50,Most Fun I Ever Had on a Bike,People watching on the beach by the ocean with very good snack places and very good bikes for rent from Perry's. Special treat to stop and watch the skateboarders. Ride on paved path from the inlet to the south all the way to Will Roger's Beach at Temescal Canyon Road in the north. This is a great way to enjoy Los Angeles.,Robert A

40,Nice,"This is a very iconic bike path, and riding along it is definitely one of the more interesting experiences when visiting southern California.",Mark42139
40,Go early or go slow,"This is an excellent path for cyclists. If you are looking to keep a decent pace you will need to be on the trail early. By late morning a lot of people who can’t read the words, “bikes only” start to wander the path. Can get very busy around SM Pier and Venice. Cafe at the north end (Will Rogers State Beach) is not always open but there a many places to stop along the way. The transition onto Washington Blvd is a but painful especially if you have kids with you so I suggest cutting through Venice side streets instead. The south end of the oath is much quieter.",Traveler2504
50,Great for walking,This is a great track for walking. We used it every morning for a long walk before we went sight seening. There is some work going on at moment but does not effect anything,Martin B

50,Bike Tour on the Beach,"In Santa Monica, you will need to rent a bike and ride from Santa Monica Pier to the Venice Pier. It is not a long ride ( 3 miles ) but along the bike path that runs thru the sand, you will see many vendors, artists, and people selling a variety of things. You will also see entertainers galore looking for a hand out. Enjoy the ride",Martin v
50,The Best,"This path is the best, such a nice place for biking, running or blading! They are currently redoing a lot of it to make it wider in Santa Monica, huge plus !",Becky RTS

50,Classic So Cal experience,We were lucky enough to visit on a clear day with no marine cloud layer - made for great pics and brought out photo worthy crowds! The rental price for the bikes were about $15. You can of course experience it on foot but we wanted the breeze in our faces!,PlayBigX
50,Beautiful and easy ride along the beach,We rented bikes from Ron's bike shop and rode our bikes from Santa Monica Pier down to Venice beach. It was fun watching the surfers and seeing the wide open beaches stretch for miles down the coast. Great people watching! Easy ride along the bike paths.,MBJ
50,Great ride along the beach .. Must Do!,"We all thoroughly enjoyed our bike ride from Santa Monica to past Venice Beach and back. We hired bikes from 4th Ave in Santa Monica for $20 all day or $15 for 2 hrs which is how long it took us. It’s an interesting ride, not particularly nice at Venice Beach with many homeless around but we rode till the path ran out and then return back to Santa Monica. November the weather was sunny but not too hot which made for a pleasant ride.",Nevest61

40,Santa Monica in October,"Great time to visit , not too many people . Had a great day cycling down past Venice and then back up,towards the Norrth.A bit of a pain that you can't cycle all the way up to Malibu as roasworks so the road is for cars only , no bikes or pedestrians. Hired the bikes from Sea Mist by Santa Monica Pier , they were great . It was a nice warm day and very easy riding , well recommended",Biggers1996
50,Don't Miss an Opportunity to Ride this Path,I've biked on this path on both of our last 2 visits to Santa Monica and it is just a beautiful way to spend a sunny afternoon in southern California. We've travelled up to Gladstone's restaurant in Pacific Palisades and down to Marina del Rey. Any direction you go is a nice ride; not crowded and no hills to deal with. Right on the beach so the views are fantastic!,Brian J R
50,Highly enjoyable to zoom along on a bike!,"This long bike path ding through Venice and Santa Monica is a lot of fun to bike, with nice wavy turns and long straight stretches. In Santa Monica the sand is regularly swept off the path, but in Venice it can get sandy, so watch out not to slip. Also be aware part of the path is shared with pedestrians, and there are crossings too. Have fun!",Bassem B.
50,Great fun,We ended up doing this a few times while on our holiday. We found it was a great way to spend the afternoon and do some sight seeing. The bike hire was very reasonable and straight forward. It was good fun and worth while.,Amy L

40,Unparalleled Ocean Front Cycling,"I have cycled this bike path MANY times. The ocean breeze, views and atmosphere are great. Care must be taken particularly in Venice, Manhattan Beach and Redondo Beach due to congestion -- skate boarders, walkers, inexperienced bicyclists and families crossing the path to get to their ideal beach blanket spot. Recently, speed limits have been posted in some areas and cyclist are required to dismount and walk bikes to protect pedestrian. Nevertheless, cycling this path should be on everyone's bucket list.",phillipkol

50,PB from New Jersey,"The 26 mile bike path is a fun way to see the coast of California. It’s an easy ride, fun for all ages",Pegge
40,Bike path is great!,This is a great bike path along the beach. However the pedestrians make it difficult by walking the path when they’re not supposed to. Be careful because the have a tendency to walk out in front of you without looking. Sand on the path can also make it dangerous. Be careful but don’t let the negatives influence your decision to go there.,Craig R
40,Nice ride and scenic.,"Rented a tandem bike and off we went. Many signs forbidding motorized bikes, skateboards and scooters but all ignored. Still no problem as there is room for all. Great experience in the sun.",Randy K

50,HIGHLIGHT,"I've always wanted to ride along Venice Beach and finally got my chance: this trip we drove and brought our bikes! Finding free or reasonably-priced parking near the beach on a busy summer Sunday afternoon was nearly impossible but, once we found somewhere, it was all worth it. We rode from Venice Pier to Santa Monica Pier and back. There are A LOT of people on this path and many different methods of transportation so don't expect to ride quickly. But that's not the point, is it? Instead, take your time and soak in the ocean, the beaches, and the people. What an amazing place to people watch (just be sure to keep your eyes on the path ahead)!",BeeDubYVR

50,The best way to see the beaches!,"I truly enjoyed the bike path. I didn't know it was 26 miles long until now 😲! It's the best way to explore the beaches and the beach side venues - stores, cafes, you name it. So easy to just park and go out and lay on the beach - eat - surf 🏄 whatever. You get the true SM and Venice vibe!!!",WanderlustStars
50,Ride to Venice Beach,"Family and I rented bikes and road to Venice Beach and North of Santa Monica. Encountered a very nice, wide bike path the entire way. At times walkers get in your way, but otherwise a very nice route.",CHRIS D
50,Great Morning Bike Ride,Stayed at the JW Marriott Merigot which offers complimentary use of bicycles. Woke up early with two of my sons and did a leisurely bike ride to the end of the bike path in Venice Beach. It’s a great way to sight see and people watch and exercise at the same time. They even provided the locks if we chose to stop & stay at a particular location. The bike trail is great though! It’s two laned and wide enough to pass. And they’re are separate lanes for walkers/runners/skateboarders/rollerbladers. Highly recommend especially in the early morning hours or late afternoon.,SparBoys
50,What a Terrific Way to Spend a Day-,"You can start in Venice if you're renting, lot's of choices for Food if you're doing Breakfast, Brunch or Lunch- if you have your own bike, then you can start anywhere where the parking is easy - and ride to Venice for Food- we like the adventure of trying the different foodie spots, supporting the local establishments and enjoying the cultural mix of L.A. Visitors, interesting Locals, Family & Friends enjoying the Fresh Ocean Air all together....",JBjeffreyl
40,Fun ride,Path in Santa Monica is cleaned everyday but Venice area is not so sand on path. Like that scooters are NOT allowed on the path,BoiseID999

50,Sights and Sounds of SoCal,"Ok, so we maybe ride about 10 total miles from north of Santa Monica to just Venice, but we got s taste of the good life just by riding and stopping al g the way to watch skateboarders, musclemen (and women) smokers, tokers and jokers. Weather was great, and kids can’t be on their phones while riding! Salt air does wonders for your attitude too.",Rick D
40,Great to be back on the bike,"Managed to hire a tandem, nice & early, before 8am. From “ The Bike Center”on Colorado St. We’d woken early after flying in from London the previous evening. Most of the other bike rentals don’t open till 9/9.30am. The young man there was very friendly & helpful, knew a thing or two about bikes which helps. Neat bike path starting by the pier & then meandering past the marina. So nice to be separated from cars.",Sue S
50,The Best Part of Our Trip!,"Such a memorable experience! Quintessential California - we felt like we were in a post card! It was an awesome way to experience the beautiful coast, eclectic people and the gorgeous sunshine!",LocalTourist85
50,It's like a beach party while you are exercising,"This blacktop path seems to go on forever and it's filled with every kind of person using every kind of wheeled device, from bikes to motor-driven skateboards and from oldsters to groups in every kind of outfit. It follows the wide Santa Monica beach and passes the big fun zone with the famous Ferris wheel, which is particularly beautiful at night or in the early morning when it is lit up. I wouldn't bother going into Venice, a place that is depressing, so go north.",CaTraveler7777
50,Awesome place to excersize or people watch,Wow! I would love for this to be my daily exercise place. Biked portions of it one day and ran portions of it another. One day my husband just walked it and people watched. There is no lack of sights!,Jen855
40,Great When Not Crowded,"The bike path can be a dream early in the morning or on cloudy days. It is very crowded on sunny days and at sunset. You're not going to speed bike at those times, but it's still a great way to enjoy the beach and get some exercise, and you can stop anywhere you want along the way.",Ricks for Free
50,Best way to get around the Bay,This is the experience you are looking for. Get it all from Malibu to Palos Verdes with every scene in between. Just don’t ride any Byrds or other electric scooters!!!!,Jim K

50,First rate bike or walking path from Pacific Palisades to below South of Venice,"Everyone on this path loves it. Run, bike or whatever these days, just get out on this path and do your thing. Be careful of individuals with disabilites and keep your speed down. THis is not a racetrack.",Gary E
50,A spectacular segment of the California Coastal Trail!!!,"Almost no other beach experience beats the 26-Mile Bike path. You can walk a few miles or ride all 26 and back in a single day. I've ridden from Santa Monica all the way to the end many times and it's always an adventure. You pass through Santa Monica to Venice across Dockweiler to Manhattan Beach and through Redondo and almost to Palos Verdes. Sure it can be crowded in some places but in others, you've got the trail to yourself. And on a weekday or off season it's pretty much wide open. It's fun to stop for food or drink along the way in one of the many places for brew or grub and you might even want to check out the action in skateboard park, muscle beach or on one of the many piers. Best part of all is if you actually ride all 26 miles and back it's a perfect workout and if you're like me, you'll probably enjoy a blissful nap at the end of the day. If I was coming to visit Los Angeles I'd check this out for sure. It's the only place in town where you can see so much up close and personal without a car. Every time I ride the path I'm thankful I get to live here. ; )",marchfool
40,"Nice winding path, well paved","I would guess this can get quite crowded in the height of the summer. For us, on a Monday, it was easy. Level riding with pleasant curves and vistas. Fun!",architect_ed

50,Great ride near the ocean,"Took a ride from Hermosa beach to the Santa Monica pier and back. During ride there was a huge variety of city scapes. Although, the ride is near the beach there are also up and down hills you will face during the path.",Jānis Baiža
50,FOLLOW THE SIGNS!,"Even as tourists flock this area I see so many people walking on a bike path where bikes and electrics and scooters are flying. You get ran over because you don’t follow the signs. There’s a walking sidewalk near the shops, not the bike path! Stay safe",JerryAscione
50,Highlight of the Trip,Loved Loved Loved cruising on the bikes to Venice beach! I would recommend the bike route vs the scooters. You can rent bikes for around $16/day,SmithTravelsAbroad
40,Glorious Beach Path!,"Loved riding bikes alongside the beach! Great for families and all ages! The path is easy, wide and well maintained. Just be careful around the sandy corners as our little guy fell off his bike and got scraped up a bit and then we saw a couple of adults wipe out around the same area. The further south you guy there are some homeless tents but the people are harmless. North side is quieter and that is the side we preferred. We rented bikes from Perry's and there are a couple of locations along the way so that if you do have any issues with your bikes you can stop at any location. Must do while in Santa Monica!",insearchofbluewater

50,Awesome!,"My daughter and I rented nicer bikes in Santa Monica and rode all the way down to Redondo beach and back. It took about six hours in total because we were going very slow and we stopped in Manhattan Beach for lunch. However, the weather was perfect and the ride was very very nice. There is one section in Marina Del Rey where you have to kind of ride on the street, through traffic, but it wasn’t bad. There are bathrooms all along the way. Highly recommended!!",amdiaz
40,beautiful and fun,We went on a sunny day and walked the path from beach to beach. This is beautiful and comfortable and except for a few places that are surrounded by people hawking stuff and bothering people along the path we really enjoyed our time here. It was definitely a must do on a saturday morning in the area!,GrnMtnGirl79
40,Bike/Walking path Santa Monica to Venice,"The path along the ocean is very nice. It has a separate area for joggers/walkers & bikers. Flat and a lot of people using the path. We started in Santa Monica and made our South past Venice Beach. Plenty of restaurants, bars and shops to eat, drink or to browse. The further South we went we saw more homeless tents, tattoo parlors and marijuana use. No one hassled us - but we felt safer closer to Santa Monica then did around VB.",Titan11Omaha
40,Fun!,"We didn’t do the entire bike path because there is a part where it stops on the beach, but it was such a fun way to see the beautiful beaches. There are bike rental places all along the trail, so you can start from anywhere you please.",summertimefun1234

50,EPIC!,The Bike Path through Santa Monica has to be one of the BEST urban bike paths in the USA. So much to see and do along the way including delicious food stands and jaw-dropping views of the Pacific Ocean. An absolute MUST DO!,misopiso88
50,Would love to ride this every day,"I make sure to rent a bike and ride this path every time I am in Santa Monica. It can get quite busy on weekends between 10am and before sunset. Then you have to watch out for pedestrians who just cannot read signs to follow the simple instruction of not walking on the bike path. Other than that it is a fantastic safe and easy ride all along the Bay past some cool beach house. You hardly interfere with cars apart from the few car park entrances and there are no other hazards (no steep hills, dips etc.) It has lots of bars, restaurants and gift shops along the way which are worthwhile to stop for to refresh or browse. There are also quite a few public restrooms if you need that other kind of break. It takes me about 2 1/2 hours from Santa Monica to Hermosa Beach and back but it is easy to stretch that out to half a day with various stops to take in the views across the beach or rest on the sand for a while. Get on a bike and do it!",Ntalabany
50,Hire a bike and enjoy 😊,"We hired bikes in Santa Monica and rode down to Venice Beach then back up and north beyond the Pier. It is a very easy ride and great fun. We visited the canals at Venice Beach too. Fabulous views, sun shining down on you made for a perfect day.",BugnBoo

50,An Asset to the City of Santa Monica!,Loved the fact that the City has invested in a great cycling and pedestrian path along the beach. We rented bikes from our hotel and enjoyed a long ride along the path. Great way to see the different beaches and piers. Lots of opportunity to stop for food/drinks and great smooth path.,Lesley C
50,Best part of Santa Monica/ Venice,"My friends and I hired bikes at Santa Monica Pier then took our time riding to Venice, stopping along the way as we wanted to.It was a really fun way to spend the afternoon and explore an iconic area.",Stacey13588
50,Great to explore the area,We took a 3 hour ride south of Santa Monica along the beaches. Very nice ride with lots of interesting people and shops around. A must do!,Andreas K
50,Electric skate board,We accessed Venice and Santa Monica beach using electric skateboards rented out the back of a van. Not to crowded and the weather couldn’t have been better. The path is smooth and well marked. Riders of all pedestrian means were very thoughtful and the wide path made passing easy. Construction around Santa Monica pier created a little dusty/debris laden path but it was a short stint.,Avakelly
50,SoCal must!!,"Was visiting the LA area for work and was looking for some fun, exercise, and Cali sun on the weekend. The Marvin Braude bike path, also know as the Strand, ended up being a blast!This bike path is pretty much flat with occasional small crests. I decided to ride the path from Redondo Beach to Santa Monica and this took me all afternoon on a Saturday. However, I did stop to shop and eat along the path. So consider this a all day trip if your looking to go the 15-20 mile mark.You can sightsee, get some exercise and soak in some sun all in one! There are many places offering rental bikes, I chose a 7 speed cruiser from Hermosa Cycling. But there are many place and many options, such as one way rentals and various bike choices ( cruisers to electric bikes ) so do your research for your preference.Overall, this bike path is highly recommended!",Laurel835
40,Relaxing,Hire a bike and use the bike path down to Venice - don't forget to have a look round the canals - set back a block from the beach. Level flat route.,Howard-Moon
50,Santa Monica Bike Path a Winner !,"My trip from Temescal Canyon to the Santa Monica Pier was a pleasant one. The weather was perfect and the sun was starting to lower over the Pacific at around 4 pm with a gentle off-shore breeze. As you head south it's pretty wide open with very few bikes and persons walking along the bike path. The closer you get to Santa Monica Pier you'll see a lot more action and persons along the beach just south of Chautauqua & Pacific Coast Highway. My final destination was Santa Monica Pier the end of Route 66 which is a historical Landmark with many tourists visiting Bubba Gumps, the Arcade, Mini Amusement Park, Mexican Restaurant Mariasol and a host of other vendors at the end of the Pier. The distance from Temescal Canyon to the Santa Monica Pier is about 3.6 miles. If you head further south you'll hit Venice Beach, Marina Del Rey, Playa Del Rey, El Segundo, Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach, Redondo Beach and the Path ends at Torrance Beach South called RAT Beach...which stands for Right After Torrance...which is a surf beach along the cliffs of Palos Verdes .... for a total of 26 Miles :-)",stevemiller007

50,Great Time of the year on the Bikepath,World class bike path - says it all. But apparently I need 100 word. I cannot tell you how much time I have spent on this path from rollerblading when I was younger to biking the entire 20 miles . Eye candy everywhere up and down.... Stop at the Beach Café in Santa Monica - It doesn’t matter what time you go early morning until sunset it’s all wonderful!,CaralinaBalerina

40,Best people watching...........so much going on,"The place is alive with activity every day. Makes me wonder if anyone works in the city. Great to walk, or hire a bike or scooter if you are a visitor. Beach was empty and the sea was fantastic if you fancy a dip.One sad note. There seems to be a lot of homeless folk about. They don't bother you, but it's just hard to reconsile with the obvious wealth of the city.",Keith W

50,Nice ride,Hired some bikes from metro bikes and it worked well went from pier to mussel beach and had a great time,Gary T
40,Be aware of your surroundings!,Path is good for the most part. Just be aware of your surroundings. You may have people run out in front of you if they are not paying attention or cyclists that are flying by next to you. Not too fond of the Venice area or Santa Monica Pier area but the rest is pretty good and clear sailing.,VizslaLI
40,"Very flat, an easy ride","Didn’t do the whole 26 Miles but did Santa Monica pier to Dockwieler beach, well marked bike path, flat ride, toilets and shops along the way. Marina del Rey was a standout, saw some seals at Fisherman’s village.",Bill252
50,Great fun riding a lot of this unique cycle path,We set off early and rode from the end of the path by the beginning of the Pacific Highway to beyond Marina del Rey passing by the pier and Santa Monica and through Venice. Very flat and easy to ride. Nice vibe with a man made path shared mostly by bikes and pedestrians. As the morning went on it became harder as the temperature rose. Lots of places to rent bicycles of all kinds and not too expensive.Would definitely recommend.,garycritten
50,Fun must do experience,"Rented bikes from just behind pier and made our way along to Venice Beach. Pricing was reasonable and they only charged for the part of the hour used rather than the whole hour. You pay at the end. Enjoyed this as a way of people watching, seeing some of the coast and feeling like we were part of things. Loved seeing all the various means of transport etc. Look out for people on electric scooters as they are sometimes moving along very quickly and not necessarily where they should be!",kathstevens2017

40,So much fun!,"We rode some bikes with the metrorail bike share program and we went from Santa Monica all the way past venice and back. It was a gorgeous trail right along the beach. It is very crowded every single day so beware if you have kids... not really ideal for ""slow riding"" since it is filled with so many people going at various speeds. Definitely something you need to check out if you got to the area!",ah0wland
50,From North to South,"Stay fit and see some amazing sites. This Path is great - from levitating jugglers outside Shutters, the madness of the Pier, the music on Venice Beach to the peacefulness of the North side it's all an experience! Lots of great bike rental venues.",Ray P
40,Good ride rude service,The ride was amazing but the guy who rent us the bikes at Perry's was very rude and he charched us more because we was late about five minutes! Don't rent from them a bike !,Gwgw Z
50,Great tome,We biked from Santa Monica to Venice and back. Easy ride however we had to dodge people most of the time. It is about 3.6 miles between the two places. Flat and wide paved path. Definitely a must do when visiting.,cw0108
50,Great experience,We hired the electric scooters at Santa Monica Beach and headed to Venice beach and back. The scooter was so much fun but best to rent a Lime Scooter as the Bird Scooters would not recognise my international drivers licence. Called into Muscle Beach and got to see the Glow cast there and had a great time at the skate park watching them do tricks. Get breezes from the beach and lots to see and do along the way. Would do it again if visiting LA!,Yvonne H
50,We went we loved we got a little tan to boot,"Rented Bikes and hit the trail or path ....Started in Santa Monica, rode thourgh venice to Marina Del Ray then went back and road to the edge of Malibu ....was a blast",Pam T
50,Great way to enjoy the beach,"We rode for about 2 hours and, aside from it being pretty hot, greatly enjoyed ourselves. Nice breeze, beautiful scenery. Go north for a less crowded experience as south of the Santa Monica pier it gets very crowded and can be a little challenging to negotiate weaving, slow riding groups, skateboards, pedestrians and (not permitted) electric scooters.Bring water and a hat.As for Venice Beach, whatever its charms, it seems to be largely a homeless encampment. People have to live somewhere but still, none too pleasant for your holiday.",Mark D
50,"Great sites, but go early and wait until fall",Leaving from Redondo and going to Marian del Ray and bake can kick your butt if your not ready for a work out. Lots of people to avoid in Hermosa and Manhattan beach cities but it is a pretty ride. Lots of decent bathrooms along the way. Bring water as not all water fountains are working well. Looking forward to doing a round trip from Redondo to Santa Monica next,llvassoc
40,Scenic Trail,Great path for beautiful beach scenery and people watching. The majority is high compression concrete so you'll definitely feel it in your knees and joints.,Andy C
50,Just do it!,"In planning our CA family trip, I ran across an article about biking the beach strand! It was amazing! We spent several hours, probably did about 25 miles, stopped for ice cream. It was a highlight of my 16 day CA adventure!",Lindy031
50,Best experience at Santa Monica and Venice beach!,"Although it was a hot summer day, all family enjoyed biking by the beach, the path is in very good condition and safe for the kids. The view is amazing. We strongly recommend it.",Yolyni
50,Great activity to appreciate the Magnificent Beach of LA,Get out and try this path if you haven't already. Our family rented bikes recently and rode about 10 miles of this path. Its fairly flat with a few hills and turns. There are lots of people sharing it but it doesn't create too much congestion. This is an amazing way to see and the wonderful coastline and appreciate the beautiful weather of Cali.,dave n
50,Truly Glorious Day!,"This route gives you so, so much to see and experience and enjoy! Set your own pace ... fast or slow... taking in the ocean views and sea breezes and the amazingly different personalities of all the different beach towns! Fancy Santa Monica, Crazy Venice, the Marina... I've done this route on foot as well (training for marathons) and no matter how you do it, there are hundreds of places worth stopping along the way. Renting those powered scooters seems to be the favored way to do it these days, but I like sticking to a bike. Just pay attention to the direction of the wind! It is quite a shock to ride with the wind at your back all morning, then have to ride upwind on the way back! (It's usually coming from the side, from the sea, so not usually an issue, but still, pay attention!)",Grateful Z
50,Lovely,We didn’t travel the full 26 miles yet we had a blast. It was a hot day (as per) and we borrowed bikes from a bike rental service. The ride was so relaxing and enjoyable; I loved every minute of it.,rainb0wreviews
10,Electric Scooters have ruined the bike path,This is now only great if you’re a self-obsessed teenager with earbuds and no respect for anyone else. If you have a young family and want to rent bikes and have a perfect day look elsewhere. 1 year ago this was perfect for that but no more. The City of Santa Monica has capitulated to the electric scooter companies and has stopped enforcing laws banning their use on the BIKE path. The result is a dramatic difference in the experience. I know of one youngster who lost three teeth to an out of control scooter rider. Beware.,brucegrn
50,Love it,"I love the vibe and this is so California just like in the movies with people skateboarding, walking, biking, rollerblading or using the Birds ... omg I enjoyed the Birds ride so much we did from Marina Del Rey to Santa Monica PierDid it in June and again with my sister in July ...Stop at the skate park, muscle beach and for a drink at Whalers",AnikF
50,Gotta Bike Venice to Santa Monica,"Too much fun. Lots of places to stop and eat and drink. But the best part about it, would be the people watching. Don't pass up spending part of your day on the best part of the LA beach scene.",philboyett
50,A Fantastic way to experience LA beaches,"Wonderful for pedal bikes, roller blading, skating, skate boards, scooters. Bring your own or rent your wheels. Keep your eyes open, no space outs here. Easy to spend a day doing this.",Mohan B
50,Brilliant way to spend time in SM,For only around $7 you can rent a bike at the Santa Monica pier and pedal your way to Venice Beach and beyond.The beach front esplanade is a great place to spend time with plenty of stops along the way. Lots of fun for the family or with friends and cheap as chips!Roller blades and scooters also available to take along the path.,Amanda C
30,Way too many motorized scooters to enjoy,"I was so glad to get away from this ""bike path""--there was no way to enjoy it because hoards of electric scooters have taken over",Terry S
50,Great Ride,"Beautiful day to ride the beach. Tons of bike rentals in Venice and we hit the path. TONS of beach. We pedalled from Marina del Rey to Santa Monica Pier (20 mins). Two lanes on the path, plus one for walkers. Most people moving responsibly except for some kids are Birds. Recommend!:)",Anilizzy
50,Awesome place to bike!,We had a fantastic time cycling along the path towards the northern stretch of the beach where the crowd thins.,YChan2016
50,A Must do activity!!,Loads of bike rental places along the front. This bike path is a must do if visiting Santa Monica. Such an idyllic cycle from the pier all the way up to Venice beach and muscle beach- taking about 15-20mins if taken leisurely. It seems to be a bit overrun with electric scooters at the moment (the new thing there) so be careful if cycling with kids or are a wary cyclist.,lauz012001
50,Highlight of our time in LA,"While in the LA area, we spent a day exploring the coast along the bike path. The scenic bike path is a very easy way to see different beach communities, take in the salt air and enjoy the sunshine! We started in Santa Monica and followed the path down to Manhattan Beach. It was wonderful! Equal parts relaxing and active so it appealed to both me and my fiance as he likes relaxing on the beach while I like exploring new places. This activity allowed equal parts of both as we made frequent stops to sit down and enjoy the soft sand and ocean breeze. One note, we picked up Bird scooters in Santa Monica to zip around on the path and once we got to Marina del Ray we were the only scooters around. After our lunch in Manhattan Beach we were unable to find any scooters in the area using the app and ended up calling a Lyft to bring us back to our accommodations in Venice. If given the option we would use the scooters again but it is important to know that you will have a hard time getting back to your starting point unless you are willing to call a ride service or keep an eye on your scooter the entire time.",Kaitlyn F
50,Love this ride,"I like to start at Wahingtom Blvd after some food at my favorite roof deck then, head thru venice to the Annenburg Beach House. Sign up to use the pool and go swim in the ocean until they text you.",Ms Maney
50,Great fun activity and for people watching,"My wife and I did not do the entire length of the path, only north of the marina. is a great way to survey the entire area before deciding on a particular location for sunbathing or stopping for a drink. Different vibes along the route and saves time to sample from a bike.",Gerard P
50,Great marathon training path,"If ever you need lots of flat miles and gorgeous views and dolphins to cheer you on through your training, this bike path is your solution.",Alex J
50,VERY COOL WAY TO VISIT THE BEACH AND CANALS OF VENICE,"This is a really good way to see most of what you need to see if you visit with family, and especially if you want to get down and into the nicer parts of Venice Beach. I highly recommend it.",David H
50,Vacatioin,Best Bike path ever been on.great pewople watching wondrful food and shopping very very very SAFE!!!!!!!!!!!,rick p
40,very nice way to go,"This path is a very nice way to enjoy the beach and the shoreline. I rented a motorized scooter and was able to travel a couple of miles in a short period of time and got to see lots of beach, people, and the shops along the road.",Misterjag
30,Watch Out for the Homeless People,"The bike path is beautiful! The city keeps the path and the beach very well maintained and clean; however, homeless people are everywhere! And at least 3 homeless men were aggressive to my family and yelled profanities. Keep your kids close!!",RoglerUGA
50,Santa Monica to Venice beach by bycycle,We rented an RV and stayed lots of places on the coast but our day in Santa Monica was a highlight. We rode our bikes to Venice beach on the 6 mile path and surfed with our kids. great ride and not to crowded.,wanterer44
50,A great way to get around...,There are rental bikes and scooters everywhere along the beach. We found Metro Bikes to be the easiest brand to rent as a tourist without a pre-existing account or US address. (Black bikes with green branding. Card payment with by the hour charging structure).I am not a confident cyclist but the bike paths here are very wide and well maintained and I did not feel crowded or unsafe.A great way to get from A to B with a beautiful view of the beach.,Laura J
50,Flat and clean road,That’s was my first cycling. But it was easy. I enjoyed cycling and meeting or watching interesting people on the beach.,Shiho K
30,"Great views, quiet pace","The path is well marked and maintained and is a great way to travel up and down the beach. There are many access walkways to get to the water, as well as numerous stores and restaurants along the way. It can get very crowded, so don't expect to whip through on your road bike at top speed. Most of the time this is a cruisers pace, shared with lots of other people, especially on weekends. Worth checking out for sure!",roscoepcoltrane
50,What a good way to take a dip in the Pacific on Saturday Morning,Road pretty much the whole trail from MDR up to Santa Monica Pier and back down from Venice around the harbor and then back down to Redondo beach. Stopped to get ice cream at Ben and Jerry's and share Sabbath services at Shul on the Beach. Traffic on the trail gets fairly heavy by 11 am so you should be on the part down before the harbor around lunch and the beaches there are much less crowded where you can stop and do Tai Chi on the shore and in the ocean. Enjoy,DrAndrewWHarrell
40,Plenty of space,"There are so many places you can hire a bike (or blades, or scooter) to ride along this stretch of coastline, and plenty to see along the way. Most people respect the 'rules of the road' and stick to the correct side of the path, but you should still keep a wary eye out for tourists taking photos - they don't always look where they're going or where they're standing! As well as excellent views, there are things like the skate park, Muscle Beach etc to stop and watch, even if you don't want to swim at the beach.",MeredithAussie
50,Trips to LA,"Super fun but you should rent a bike or motorized scooter! A great adventure as a couple or with family. Lots to see, so many places to stop and eat/drink. We rode from Santa Monica Pier and past Venice Beach!",Russ V
50,"Cycling on a beach, where can you do that???","Not many places I guess, where one can ride a two-wheeler on the beach. Perfectly wide bike-path, sometimes shared with foot traffic. Great for exploring the beach area. At first rented a bicycle for an hour, which is a better workout, but I also wanted to try out one of those electric scooters you can find all over Santa Monica. Had already registered the night before, so was able to use them fast.",Bert V
50,Bike rental from Venice Beach to Santa Monica.,"This is a scenic and busy, at times, ride. Keep your head up and and be aware but enjoy the scenery.",JALToronto

50,The atmosphere!,Such iconic views ! Feels like you are in an 80's movie etc :) Shops and food restaurants everywhere!,dimpoe
50,Long and crowded but fun,It was crowded but the bike path is a ton of fun if you rent a scooter and scoot down the path I could have done it for hours the view is also nice Right next to the ocean,Jake1275
50,Lots of T&A,So much so that you hurt your neck!Seriously though this place is amazing. By the way you could go 52 miles on the bike without leaving the path,Dave P
50,Really an absolute must do when in Santa Monica - Venice Beach area,"After walking a couple of times we decided to try the BIRD small electrical bikes, everybody seemed to be using. Took us a little while to set it up for the first time but after that everything went great.Really nice scooting around on the long Bike Path, enjoying the view of the area and peaple",BrynjarOrn61
50,Must do bike ride!,Can’t recommend this enough! great way to see the sights along the beach - easy wide bike only some shared with walkers & skaters paths.1/2 day is probably enough - you can go malibu to way past venice beach if you wish. Note nothing much happens until after 10 am. Cheap activity - great fun.,didjjetta
50,Excellent bike path,"Excellent bike path, stunning views. Flat and well maintained. Especially liked Venice boardwalk. Highly recommend.",HannatheHiker
50,Best part of our trip.,"This was the highlight of our trip. We went out on a Saturday and it was very crowded you must be on high alert at all times. As people walk on the bike trail, cross without looking and stop for no reason. With that being said I would have loved to spend more time on the trail.We rented bikes using ride share. It was about a 2.5 mile ride to Venice Beach. We stayed fairly close to Santa Monica and Venice Beach due to the service area of the bikes. I would have loved to do a full day rental and explore the area further. If your only wanting to go a couple miles check out Santa Monica Bike Share to save some money and hassle.",DESYLAY123
50,This makes the Santa Monica beach,"The Santa Monica and Venice beaches are big and very nice, don’t go on Sundays thoughWay too crowded with a mix environment of people Some coming from bad areas of LASo just go on any other dayThe bicycle track is the main reason to enjoy the beach, really beautifulThe Ocean is never warm enough to swimAnd pretty polluted tooDon’t expect the Amazing MediterraneanIt’s a very cold ocean sometimes even in July and August the weather is cold and foggyEnjoy the bicycle track instead",Mariacristina Heller
50,"Great way to enjoy the area""",We love walking and can walk forever on this path. Enjoyed seeing all the activities taking place along the path. Also can stop and grab beverages or munchies along the path. Great Southern California activity if like being at or near the beach.,pslot
50,Family bike ride,We had a lovely half day bike ride along the bike path. We hired bikes in Santa Monica and rode both south to Venice Beach and north from Santa Monica. Thoroughly enjoyable on a sunny day and good for all fitness levels.,fitzy3169
40,Rent a bike and get out there,"I rented a bike at Sea Mist right under the pier, Sean and Tim were very friendly and helpful, I got a bike and helmet for $7 an hour. Bike was in good condition, great exercise, excellent way to get the lay of the land. Stongly recommend going down the path. Caveat emptor, if you are interested in renting a bike at Sea Mist, they only take cash, and be prepared to leave your ID as a guarantee",Eduardo G
50,Great place to ride a bike or scooter.,Highly recommend renting a bike to travel along the beach. It can get crowded so be aware of the traffic flow.,angelacI4434TR
50,Rented Electric Bikes for the path to Venice!,We decided to spend the extra money and pay $100 each for electric bikes for the day. Was totally worth the money. If you want to spend some time along the beach between the Pier and Venice Beach...highly recommend renting electric bikes or razor scooters. There were A LOT of people even for April and it gets VERY crowded so if you are not comfortable riding in a tight crowed you might want to reconsider. It's like driving in L.A. traffic!! We were able to lock up our bikes to visit the pier and eat lunch in Venice Beach at the Venice Bar which I highly recommend.,Kai T
50,Must do,"When staying on or near the beach, walks, jogs, bikes or scooters this is the best way to be outside and taking in the beauty of southern California.Wonderful diversity of people and cultures mixed a long a boardwalk of activity for miles.Do not leave santa Monica without a stroll along this beach super walkway.",pcg123
50,One of the best things around,"Don't worry about how to hire the bikes - many hotels have them or are eager to help with the hiring of them. The bike path is a beautiful and fun way to see the area - go early before it gets too hot. Yes, you'll hear about the homeless who use the parkland area around the bike path - they do, and there is lots of them but they never bothered us here (San Francisco was another story but not here).",Belgo96
50,The best thing to do !!,"we hired bikes outside our hotel, they were very friendly and ensured we had the right height bikes especially as i had young children.The route is amazing ample space i have to say it was the best afternoon of my holiday.Dont worry about hiring the bikes before you get there, there is lots of people renting out bikes and it is not too expensive.",trusha2016
50,Favourite thing to do at LA beaches,Santa Monica and nearby Venice have plenty of places to rent bikes. Don't let the homeless worry you - it's still a good place to rent bikes and cruise along witnessing LA beach culture.,Saska2nian
50,A great walk well worth the time,Thoroughly enjoyed our walk on the bike path and would highly recommend it to anyone else! Great way to work off all the American food we’ve been eating!,Graeme I
50,Exercise and a show!,"The 26 mile bike path, on a picture perfect LA day, served as a great way to spend the day. We left at 9 am from Santa Monica and made our way all the way to the end at Torrence. There is something special about getting to mile 0.00...only to remember that you had to go back!We used the hotels bikes, probably not made for that long a trip , but still so glad we could pass through each town and experience the different culture and tenor of each. Loved all of the boats in Marina Del Ray, the quaintness of Manhattan beach and of course the total scene of Venice. There was so much to look at, it was hard to pay attention to the path.Lessons learned - go early in the day because the tourist traffic makes the ride both frustrating and dangerous later in the day. Don’t forget the sunscreen! The beautiful breeze fools you but that sun is still dangerous!Enjoy the ride!",JerseyAmy
30,Always crowded but fun,This is such a great bike path especially for exercise however it is incredibly crowded because it is so popular..,Lisa M
50,How can this not be Excellent!!,"The bike path is the best place you can be in Los Angeles...Sun, Sand, fresh air...a beautiful place. Great People watching,However it has become more and more crowded...so must be alert, and obey the bike and pedestrian rules...as now all kinds of mode of transportation is on the path..I don't know how so many of the ""BIRD"" scooters are being allowed on the strand..NO HELMETS! Accident waiting to happen.Personally going from MDR to Redondo is the best direction...I live here and won't do the other direction on the weekends.",Diane C
40,So fun!,A must do! Loved it so much! My teenage girls loved it too! So much to see and do. U can stop and take pics anywhere! Just beautiful. When it’s busy it’s hard to ride but still manageable .,3peepsocon
50,Excellent walk/bike path on the Santa Monica beach,"The bike path along the Santa Monica beach is excellent. Stretches from Santa Monica to Manhattan beach with amazing views of the ocean. You can rent bikes, roller blades and segways along the beach. Path is wide and is nicely marked for two way traffic. On many part of the path, you can walk along the bike path too. If you love nature and enjoy the outdoors, this is a must while visiting Santa Monica.",mcorbin560
40,Busy and filled with people who don't know how to bike,"Riding the beachside bike path is wonderful and infuriating. You got pedestrians who walk 5-abreast, people who wobble frantically all over the place and think it's funny, families who put young children on bikes and think we can see them when they suddenly dart over the yellow line. We witnessed a child get badly hurt when they just jumped out onto the path in front of a cyclist under a bridge. There was no way the cyclist could have stopped in time. If you're one of those people who thinks the rules of bike safety don't apply to you - do everyone a favour and stay off the bike path.",yycsullivan
50,Beach Ride,My two teen sons and I enjoyed renting bikes and riding along the path between Santa Monica and Venice. Rentals are $7 per hour. It was worth it!,Shannon S
30,"Hey, walkers, it's a bike path!","Lovely cycle, lots of places to see, beautiful views, and it's flat, so easy for less proficient cyclists.As for the walkers, by the end of my cycle I seriously considered the term ""justifiable homicide"". I really wish there were some enforcement, aside from being hit by s bike, which people clearly don't care about.There is a walking path LITERALLY 2 steps away, yet people insist on walking and standing in the bike lanes. At first I was like, ""look where you are, it's so beautiful, breath deeply, let it roll off you..."" By the end I was cycling very close to people hoping to scare the crap out of them and yelling ""bike path!""So, beautiful, but it will not bring out your inner calm. And tourists and people of Santa Monica, be aware of your surroundings and read a damn sign.",paynbow
50,Must do! - bike rentals a big plus!,"Definitely rent some bikes for an hour and take in the views. Absolutely loved the experience and just enough time to see the ocean, people, mountains... many walkers but bikes are the way to go.",theskiing62018
50,Fun way to hang out,"We rented bikes here and we worked on our cardio, place is really neat and roads are smooth, great way to spend your morning!",Christopher Navas Go
50,Wide open for tunners,Great path along the coast. Passes thru iconic beach locations that are worth a stop along the way. Take your time to take it all in.,JOHealy
40,Fun way to explore along the coast,Good way to get outdoors and either rent bikes or do some walking. The path is wide and has some curves. Very safe for older kids in your group.,Joe P
50,Great bike path,Great bike path along the beach. Lots to see while biking and it goes for miles and is relatively flat so the biking is easy although a little crowded in some places.,George G
50,Beautiful ride/walk,"This path is an awesome way to see some of the LA area's best beaches. There are a bunch of bike and roller blade rental places along the path, you don't have your own. Makes a really nice half day activity.",Shannon W
50,Traveling runner’s gym away from home,Staying in Venice for a few nights and ran the bike/pedestrian path 3 times. The path is well maintained including a daily street cleaner removing sand from the surface. There are a decent amount of bathrooms and garbage cans as well as decent signage to off path attractions.,dsj5777
50,Amazing bike ride,If you come to Santa Monica you have to take this ride. Great ways to see the ocean. We loved every single moment of it. Amazing.,Babumannan
50,Amazing bike path by the beach on the LA coast,"We explored this bike path from Santa Monica to Venice over a few hours and its fantastic. Enough space for everyone to move, cool sights, lots of places to stop (playgrounds, bathrooms, places to eat) and to chain up your bikes. Tons of bike rental places around. Amazing views and just a really fun way to spend a day.",David M
50,Great leisurely way to ride & get some site seeing in & tourist gawking in,"I have a thick tire coaster bike and feel comfortable riding, but have two sets of friends who have narrow tire racing bikes who have taken bad spills on a couple of the curve corners that have had sand blow up on the paved bike way - suddenly the bike just slips out from under them - also be carful of the new bird electric scooters that can sneak up on you",amynjim
50,Must do while in Santa Monica,"Your hotel may offer a bicycle as part of your room package if not there are bike rentals. I recommend riding to Venice Beach, there are many shops and restaurants as well as the Venice Beach Muscle Beach Area.",theblueox
40,See it all,"The beaches are lovely. They were pretty empty but there was lots of action along the path. We enjoyed our bike ride and saw all manner of wheeled action from bikes to skateboards to motorized scooters and rollerblades. There was a bagpiper out, some homeless people along the path, people pumping iron at Muscle Beach, and folks out slacklining. The ride up Washington to the bike trail to Marina del Rey wasn’t bad but we had to turn back before making it to Redondo Beach so I can’t speak to whether that part was worthwhile. Overall a lovely way to spend a few hours.",MJBSLC
40,Lots of fun path,"It is to be able to appreciate diversity in people, cultures and follies. I did not like that the whole path smells of marijuana, I did like that my children could experience coexistence with those who think and do differently and that it is up to each person to be whatever they want to be. Here we could see everything from semi-naked people, drugged to healthy and doing fitness, but all fun. The things that are sold in business are great and the atmosphere is spectacular. There are urban artists who sing and dance and you can interact with them all. It is a must to visit if you come to Cali.",Rafael G
50,Awesome Bike Path!,"No trip to Santa Monica is complete without riding the bike path! My wife and I rented two bikes and rode from Santa Monica to Venice and back. We had a great time sightseeing and checking out all the shops and things to do in between. I was amazed at all the different activities people were doing along the path such as yoga, volleyball, basketball, dance, spray painting, selling arts & crafts, filming a music video, etc. There was never a dull moment. I would highly recommend you ride down this bike path :)",filmmofo
50,Blading on the Bike Path,Fantastic. Love it. It is one of the best paths in the world to blade on. Some great places to stop off as well.,Altstadt_White

50,So fun!,Loved this bike path. Part of our fav thing to do during our trip to Santa Monica. Rode from Samar Monica to Venice beach and back. The path is easy to use and everyone seems to respect the designated bike path areas. A ‘must do’ for any stay in Santa Monica/Venice,Hanna W

50,My favorite part of Santa Monica,One of the best bike/walking/rollerblading paths anywhere. Beautiful scenery and everyone having fun.,SkiandSkate
50,Fun Ride through several Los Angeles Beach Neighborhoods,"I have riding this path for many years, and it is truly an iconic Los Angeles, must see-and-do highlight. A great way to see several of the most interesting beach neighborhoods in LA.For athletic and attractive people watching, to interesting street performers, to countless beach goers, as well as great sightseeing, this path has it all.Designed for cyclists, skaters and other modes of wheeled transport, this path allows for ""traffic free"" passage along the beach-front. That said, it can get busy on weekends and often pedestrians can overlook the rules, but all in all it is a great bike path where most people adopt to the rules making for a great experience.The path runs from Santa Monica Pier, South through Venice Beach and Marina Del Rey.",RG_WorldTravel
40,Great riding on weekdays in the morning,"This is an excellent bike path. Beautiful scenery, pavement in generally good condition, and if you ride the full length it passes through some of the best places in SoCal. The afternoon winds can be an issue if you're headed north in the afternoon, so schedule accordingly. But avoid it on weekends at all costs. Saturdays and Sundays bring so many utterly oblivious pedestrians that riding it will become an exercise in frustration, and actually dangerous. Summer weekday afternoons can also have similar, if slightly less extreme, conditions. And the area right around the Santa Monica pier is always pedestrian congested and they never bother to look both ways, or even look up from their phones, as the cross the path.But on quiet weekday mornings, it's utter heaven!",SharkStormsRUs
40,Great way to see the area,"We had bikes from our hotel and enjoyed a ride through Santa Monica, Venice Beach, etc. the path is well marked and large enough to share the road with walkers, skaters, and skooters. Many things and people to see along the road so you have to keep your eye on the road. We would have gone further and perhaps out to Malibu but it was slow going with our very heavy comfort bikes, 3 gears, and lots of people.",maxpaste
50,Loved biking along the ocean!!,"Loved biking along the ocean!! This is a beautiful, safe path with outstanding views. Its easy to bike to breakfast on the beach, or even other towns.",Amy H

50,Hire a bike - The pathways are great and you see alot more than by walking.,Hire your bike for the full day its much cheaper at $30US than by the hour at $10US Bikes have their own paths so you dont have to dodge those walking and your safely off the busy roads and for those who love to cycle you can take your bike and see all the beaches along the coast. The weather in January is perfect for cycling with temps around 20-24 with a nice breeze coming off the ocean - You cant beat it.,karenjwilson27

50,Great ride from Santa Monica to Venice Beach,Hired a tandem and two individual bikes to ride from Santa Monica to Venice Beach - great afternoon after a few days at Disneyland!,TravelwiththeBlakes
40,Probably the safest bike path in LA,"My friends and I always take this bike path to avoid traffic and parking during the summer months. It’s a great way to exercise and from LAX to Santa Monica, it’s only about a 30 min ride. Save gas and ride a bike.",Ruth D
50,Bike trail from pacific palisades to Palos verdes,"Great bike trail on the beach. Can go for miles. It does get really crowded in spots (Venice, Santa Monica). Flat, smooth paved bike path. Great for cruising or more stenosis biking. Please wear a helmet. So much activity and opportunity for a collision.",Mikelemberg
30,Parade of Humanity,"If you enjoy people watching and can tolerate crowds, this may be for you. Living in LA County, our expectations are clear. However, when in Santa Monica, we will do a few miles on the path for the light exercise and ocean air. For native New Yorkers, as we are, we consider this Central-Park-by-the-sea.",VictorEast
50,A must do!,My family took the bike path from the Santa Monica Pier to the end of Venice beach. It was the highlight of our trip! If I had the bike rental longer I would have taken the whole path!,carlettems
50,Can't beat this...,Absolutely amazing opportunity to see the beachside communities of LA while careening along the Pacific coast. Grab a bike or motorized scooter ...and get going!,14tidewater
50,Grab a bike and go!,"We rented bikes at Loews. $8/hr! DEAL! We had a few cruisers and a hybrid. The path is well taken care of! This makes for an easy way to see Santa Monica and Venice Beach areas! A lot of walkers wander into bike path and sometimes it is a shared path. Wave and say ""Hi"" to the most interesting humans around! I wish I had time to stop and get a massage by the beach from the therapist waiting by the path! Venice Beach is quite interesting and it educated my kids in a different way. They now know distinct smells! @_@ And they learned valuable lessons about homelessness and other lifestyles than ours. All in all a great experience! Stop and enjoy the beauty!",FlyingMommy2013
50,Awesome boardwalk to ride anything on wheels! Great beach boardwalk location!,"The best way to travel in Santa Monica on the beach! We love this bike trail! You never know what you might see! From skateboards, bikes, scooters, strollers, joggers, walkers, and our 4 legged friends everyone enjoys having the beach and open air to cruise to. Grab your Bluetooth speaker and cold drink you are sure to have a blast. Even threw Venice it seems to be a different world. We love that the entire area is diverse and outdoors! Please be mindful of the beach people and park people you see that made the beach and areas around the bathrooms there home. If you keep your eyes open you may even pass a star!",Yehbut
40,Great fun!,We rode from Santa Monica pier to Venice beach return. It was great fun and magic weather. Several places to get food/drink along the way.,JOA09
50,Awesome bike path,"Have been riding this bike path since I was a kid. The cities have done an amazing job of making this a fun and safe place to ride from town to town without worrying about cars. Good for adults and kids alike. Easy and mostly flat with a view of the beaches that can’t be topped. Only downside is lots of people, but it is LA and that is what makes it interesting. This is one of the things I miss the most since moving to San Diego, but I still come back several times a year to visit and walk/ride the strand.",Geekette92064
50,peace and biking,"don be shy, rent a bike and ride. this path is flat and fantastic, you will cross several neibourhoods and sigth seeings, but avoid the touristc attractions and popular stores, research before go, cause there is a lot of trick offers on the beach front. ask for hotel assistante and rent a bike in your hotel, its better.",Mattartrip
50,Great way to see the beach cities!,"Favorite place to walk my dog, go for a run, or just people watch in Santa Monica and Venice. You can see the vibe and atmosphere change as you travel through different cities along the path. There's muscle beach if you're in the mood for a workout, and the tight ropes and acro equipment if you want to watch people performing superhuman feats. Definitely worth an hour or two!",Ashley B
50,A pleasure,"Very nice to walk from Santa Monica to Venice , brunch at "" eggslut"" and ride the bike bath back . Sunshine and great views . Surprised to see homeless encampments .One of the simple highlights of our trip",Joan P
50,This is a must do,We had such a great time riding bikes up the Ocean to Venice beach. Ours were in with our hotel deal. They are so easy to ride to very chichi do it it’s great fun.,K B H
50,Love Riding - then you'll love this bike path,"Not only is this for bike riders, but throw in the skate-boarders, roller skaters and straight up pedestrians - makes this a hibe of activity and a great way to get into the true Californian groove. Highly recommended - for sight-seeing as well as exercising and just getting around on a budget",ChristinaMCGM
40,Be careful,"Great path but with everyone looking at the sites it can be a bit dangerous! We were there on a Saturday morning and rode from Santa Monica Pier to Venice (about 10-15 minute ride), saw a kid have a very bad wipe out with lots of cuts to knees hands and face so be careful!!!!",harrywCalgary
40,Nice route,"Here you can ride on funny looking bikes, others go inlines or rollerskating.Do not expect any tempo training, as this paved stretch will also be filled up by walkers.Also note that many turists on bicycles do it for the first time in life, so sometimes it becomes chaotic",Phayao13
50,Always a must do when visiting LA's beach towns,"The light version is to rent a bike in Santa Monica and turn around at marina del rey at Washington. This will take an hour or two depending on your speed and stoppage.The full version is to go all the way down to Manhattan beach. This requires a medium to high level of health as you will be on a bike 2 hours each way.I like to do the full and do a good 2-3 hour stop in Manhattan beach to eat and hang out at the beach...i think a lot more stuff going on then in santa monica (less tourists)alternatively, rent a bike down in Manhattan beach and do a light Manhattan to redondo round trip that will be 1-2 hours max.either way you can't lose. wear sunblock and be very careful with all the tourists crossing the bike path without watching where they are going.",ChezCarrere
50,A must do,"The best way to view the South Bay beaches is on a bike. Sun, sand, ocean, people watching, exercise. Check prices online of bike rental costs if you don't have your own bicycle as there is much variance in costs. Most of the path follows the edge of the strand, but at times will go around obstacles. Also during very busy weekends, you will be directed by signage to dismount and walk your bike for safety sake. Just remember that on a hot day the path is not circular, so you will have to cycle all the way back to your starting point.",Fish-Fun-Seaker
50,What a great way to spend the day!,"We cycled north as far as we could (not very from SM) - a lovely ride and saw a school of dolphins playing close to the shore on our return, what a thrill. South we only went as far as Venice, but stopped off along the way at the skatepark and muscle beach, and went inland at Venice to cycle round the canal area and Abbott Kinney. A great way to catch the sun and get around - would thoroughly recommend Ron at Santa Monica Bike Rental on 4th- cheap, and lovely easy service. Just be very careful not to accidentally ride down onto the freeway when coming off Ocean Ave to the sea, by the pier!",Lindsey B
40,Wonderful bike ride,"This wide and fenced bike path is perfect for the family. It is safe, wide and clean. It takes you right to the Santa Monica Pier, restaurants and shopping.",Cynthia H
40,"Long, flat bike path","You can rent bikes at several along the bike path. The middle of the day tends to get very hot, so early or later in the day works best. And watch out for pedestrians. Even though there are separate paths for bikes and pedestrians, some of them don't pay attention.",Alexandra T
40,Great SoCal Experience!,"My husband and I borrowed bikes from our hotel and rode just from Santa Monica to Venice Beach and back. We stopped for brunch in Venice Beach and spent some time watching the skaters in the skate park and the whole trip tool about 3 hours. The path is flat and pretty wide although it narrowed in Venice Beach. It was fun to see Muscle Beach, the surfers, and people watch in general. You get a fun LA vibe by doing this path. It was fairly crowded when we were there in October, so I imagine it's worse in the Summer. You just have to be patient and try not to hit the pedestrians that decide to walk on the path. It's very flat and an easy ride with great views of the beaches. I highly recommend.",Kate L
50,Worth doing,"Great flat ride with the most interesting sights and sounds along the way. However caution needed with wayward pedestrians walking along the bike path and sand making some areas a bit slippy under the wheels. Fairly easy cycling even for this 50 year old, overweight woman. Great fun would recommend.",Zonda2016
50,Favorite activity in Santa Monica,Loved renting bikes and riding down 26 mile path in Santa Monica/Venice Beach. Two seperate paths for bikes and pedestrians!,Darcy1326
50,Bike Path,"Loved this bike path. Rode in mornings up to Canyon Road intersection where path signals no bikes past a certain point, then back past the pier to Venice beach again where the path seems to divert you to a road to continue South. I think navigating past the Marina the path continues to earn its name. But wasn't quite sure of how to connect the path from Venice beach to the path past the Marina. Just got off the plan from Australia and I was a bit scared in right sided traffic and didn't really like the traffic volume on a major road that must have taken you to the path continuation. So I just did some loops of the above and loved it",andrewjpatten
50,Absolutely Excellent - Just Go Early,Hired a bike from a reputable shop and headed out from Santa Monica Pier towards Venice Beach and Marina Del Rey.Took it easy taking in the sights. Fantastic way to start the day. It gets really busy later in the morning onwards at weekends so an early start is recommended.A little snakey in parts and loose sand blown over the path means care needed...... Just don’t bomb on.Superb sights and easy to navigate too. Felt 100% safe.Came back under the pier after Venice and Marina and headed the other way to take in the less interesting but still worthwhile pathway including a steep incline up to the promenade - optional if you are not adventurous or fit.Best experience of my short stay. Fantastic experience and would highly recommend.,YorkTraveller1962
50,I wish London had this too,"It is a very safe area: safe for biking etc or simply walking. The views are also to die for and whether you are in Marina del Rey or simply walking towards Santa Monica, you have the ocean with the sand to one sand and some amazing houses, in some areas, or shops, restaurants etcYou can see the fitness fanatics or the street vendors selling some rubbish or little souvenir shops: also what I liked is that people are so friendly.Although it can be very cold when the wind picks up - so make sure you dress appropriately.",TERRAvelista
40,Great concept for a large area,"This paved walk/cycle lane is fantastic to have in such a busy tourist location.The paved cycle path is generally home to cyclists, walkers, runners, skateboarders, rollerbladers etc.The whole pathway is safe with pedestrian crossings over to the beach at safe locations.The pathway takes you from beyond Venice beach on one side right the way down Santa Monica beach and well beyond.There are garbage cans dotted along the way so usually remains clean and litter free.Dog owners are really good at cleaning up dog mess also.There's usually a police presence seen alone the long stretch usually around the Venice beach location which is reassuring.There many restroom facilities along the way also and plenty benches to sit back and enjoy the ocean.",ETHEL C
50,The famous 26 mile coastal path!,"We've done the whole ride - in stages!It is best done on a week day as weekends are quite crowded. Easier to bike during week. Any time is a good time but fall and spring especially nice as the summer crowds have thinned and the weather is usually delightful.Part of the ride we have done many times, just from Santa Monica through Venice is great fun.The characters that you see along the way are a big part of the adventure. I recommend taking plenty of time over the path - drink in the experience!",Jonathan W
50,excellent way to see the beach communities,"IF you do the whole 26 miles ....It is a long ride. It is equally fun to do portions of the bike path. It is best done on a week day as weekends are quite crowded...high speed bikers, children with poor bike control, walkers who seem unable to read the bike path sign( there is a walking path). Easier to bike during week.Any time is a good time but fall and spring especially nice as the summer crowds have thinned and the weather is usually delightful. THere are rentals just north of the Santa Monica pier and many places in between.Going just from Santa Monica through Venice is fun..stop for snacks or a meal, enjoy watching some of the skaters and boarders, admire art work and jewelry ( more on the weekend)If you elect to do the whole 26 miles you will be off the water path and on a street path to get through the marina. Do wear a helmet especially there.You could also start in Redondo beach..walk that pier, have some seafood, crack your own crabs if you like but you will smell like crab the rest of the day. The path to the marina would be a good ride. Get off the bike in Hermosa Beach or Manhattan Beach and look at the shops one block up. On second thought, might be better to bike and do those shops as a walking day later.You can watch beach volley ball players, especially by the Manhattan Beach pier. Do not turn your head to the side to ogle the players or you may go into the sand and over the handle bars head first!!!...not necessarily lethal but definitely embarrassing.IT is such fun to be out biking that you may forget to watch where you are going.",femderm13
40,Flat w/ a sea breeze,The bike path is well marked along the beach. When the path goes through Marina Del Rey it can be a little confusing. Heading down Washington turn right onto the path after the pond. Follow it along the park until you cross the street at the library. Its marked through the parking lots.If you choose to ride between santa monica and venice keep an eye out for novice riders stopping without notice and pedestrians not paying attention.,Grant D
40,Beautiful Beach Views,"Until I developed a medical disability, I used the 26 mile bike path almost daily for two years and never got bored. The views of the ocean and the backdrop of the Malibu Hills are always delightful, and the trail is great for people watching. My only caveat is that not all of those miles are created equal. Heading south from Will Rogers State Beach, you will cross two large parking lots (not scenic in themselves, but with elevated ocean views). These are usually almost empty unless the Beach is being used for a film shoot--and if it is, there's activity to dodge, but it is interesting to watch. As you descend into Santa Monica Beach, the scenery is more typically beachy and then you'll travel through a tunnel under the Santa Monica Pier and emerge into ""old"" Muscle Beach which is often full of folks doing fantastic feats on ropes, rings, and slack wires. A little farther south and you're in Venice Beach which has a whole new vibe of street vendors and performers. Here the bike trail will take you by a fantastic skateboard park, and it is worth your while to stop and watch the antics. Alas, about a half mile farther south your beach idyll is interrupted by an inland swing through Marina Del Rey. This part of the trip runs a zig-zagging course on city streets and through ugly parking lots. I usually stopped my bike path journeys at this point, preferring to cover the pretty part several times in order to increase my mileage.",Cornelius T
50,DO IT!,Rent a bike - approx. $20 per day - and do the bike path. It takes you all along the beach in both directions. The path is pretty level so no particular fitness level is required. It was a great ride with beautiful views and being right on the water you didn't overheat.,Bossy075
50,Quintessential LA experience - packed full of attractions,Have done this ride 3 times in 4 years with the kids. Each time on holidays from Australia and not staying in Santa Monica. We make the trip from DTLA just for the ride .It is a must do ... again and again ... You spend an hour or a day.So much to see and do along the ride:- Santa Monica pier- exercise equipment (have to try the ring swings)- Muscle Beach- pick up basketball- hand ball- beach volleyball- beach- ice creams stands- Venice people watching- Venice markets- skate bowlThat is all just in the short section from Santa Monica to Venice. Can also go in land at Venice to the canals and Abbott Kinney shops (both definitely worth doing).There is always something different to see or some event on as well.,Neulara
50,Terrific way to get some gentle exercise,"What a great way to see Santa Monica and Venice. Very easy ride, except coming back up the incline from beach to street level. Very well designed and maintained. A must do.",PFHK
50,Number one thing to do in Santa Monica.,Loved cycling on the cycle path. Disappears in Venice Beach so look on a google map if you want to cycle more than the 3miles from Santa Monica to Venice. Need to find the path which goes round marina del Ray,Gill F
50,Loads of fun,The bike path is awesome ! We hired bikes and road them down to Venice beach where we returned them . Great way to see Santa Monica beach .,trickytrac
50,Worth the Visit,"We were pleasantly surprised to discover the 26 mile bike path. We were staying in Venice Beach and rented bicycles from a local vendor. The bike route is amazing. It mainly runs on the bike path along the ocean, but for a brief time in Marina Del Ray, the route takes you along a busy road. So, if you have children, be aware you will need to watch them during this part of the route. The path passes by such beautiful homes and scenery, it was definitely one of the highlights of our visit to this area. There are food stands along the route so you are able to purchase snacks and fluids as needed. Enjoy!",JAH_Chicago_Paris
50,free and great to walk or bike!,you can rent bikes at various locations. Its a very easy ride! We walked it from Santa Monica through Venice and it was a great workout. plenty to see and do along the way!,Misonix
40,bikeway with lanes for both directions,"Quite broad bikeway with 2 lanes, one for each directions, so this makes this bikeway quite comfortable. It goes parallelly to the walkway most of the time.",Maximilian H
50,Endless hours of free fun !,"Epic route with great views and plenty of places to stop along the way for beach, food, relaxing, pier, shops, etc.... Rentals shops all along to pickup some bikes, segways, tandoms, etc....",Devan C
50,SEA MIST,"We rented from sea mist and hired good bikes with baskets for $20 for the dayFantastic value!We first cycled towards Malibu and considering it was a Saturday it was quietWe crashed out on the beach for an hour the came back to the pier locked the bikes and went into town for lunchWe then cycled out past Venice , again it wasn't too busyWhat a brilliant fun day out !!It'll last long in our memories after we head home to a cold rainy UK",ricmarknic
50,Tandem fun had by all,"We hired 2 tandem bikes for the family ( kids 10 and 8) and loved it, we started at Santa Monica and biked past muscle beach to the pier south of Venice beach and back, it was a great 2 hours, the bike path was excellent, busy but no dramas, this two hours was one of the highlights of our Holiday, the cost was $80USD but well worth the bike hire",Martin G
50,GO FOR THE MARATHON AND ENJOY,This resource is a cyclists or tourists dream come true. Nothing better than going for a casual bike ride for however far your budget and your butt can stand. The road system is perfect and goes on and on and on. Lots of great stops along the way including restrooms. You couldn't ask for better. Plan on at least a couple of hours so as to really enjoy the experience,SenorGancho
40,Best cycle track !!,"Borrowed bikes from our hotel and off we went not expecting such a wonderful facility - didn't attempt the full 26 miles but certainly found the route great fun - the pedestrians respect the cycle path which is wide enough to pass slower riders easily whilst avoiding oncoming cyclists - plenty of sites to see path goes via Santa Monica past Venice Beach and onwards - fresh air, exercise & sunshine included !!",mark30121963
50,Amazing bike trail along the beach,"We loved biking on the paved Marvin Braude cycling trail which goes from the Will Rogers State Beach in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles to the Torrance County Beach. The mid point is in the Playa del Rey residential area. For the vast majority of the time the trail goes along the beach, but there are occasional sections where it deviates and a few sections where you go on the road but in very well marked and safe cycle lanes. Its very easy riding, flat all the way. Its very wide with clearly marked sections for cyclists and walkers / joggers. The views are amazing all the way. Plenty of places where you can hire a bike, get a coffee or a snack or go to the rest room. We cycled from Playa Del Rey, through Marina Del Rey and Venice to Santa Monica pier and back A total distance of 16 miles. Great fun and a fantastic way to spend a morning or an afternoon, with a swim to cool down at the end of the ride.",SueJim126
50,Clearly marked track - joggers & cyclists share happily,"Son hired a bike and did the full loop to Redondo and back, daughter & I hired town bikes and went to Venice pier , over to Venice canals and back - joggers and cyclists share the pathway well, great way to see the area",julesfhants
40,"Nice ride, but a little disappointing","The 26 mile Bike trail that goes from Santa Monica to Manhattan Beach does exist. It does not however go on the beach the entire way as the map might indicate. You will be on the road , some of it busy once you get to The Venice Pier.We rented bikes in Venice from a bike shop whose name escapes me. They are are Venice Blvd right near 17th street.We headed towards Venice and found to get around Marina Del Rey you need to go on the street, then again near LAX.We stopped at Marina Del Rey, went around a little bit then came back and went through Santa Monica under the pier.The sites of Venice Beach and Muscle Beach are what you expect but it’s a “must see”. Going under the pier is an added plus.Before you rent or ride get the most updated maps. Had I not seen a police officer on a bike I would never have known which way to go.",Koyote1
50,Awesome bike path!!,"This is one of the best bike paths I've been on. It's especially wide. Separates the walkers/joggers from bikers. It also offers ample places to hope off, grab something to eat, use a restroom, etc. Great way to spend half a day.",Jkarr11
40,"Not too strenuous, but you'll work up a sweat","Rode south 10 miles from the pier (and back) to just south of LAXNice, smooth path, except for the trip around Marina Del Rey, which got a little confusing, and had to battle some street trafficNice site seeing and people watching, while getting a little exercise",txbride
50,fresh air and sea breeze on bike,"Great way to explore the coast line and beach area. plenty of shops ,sights and people watching along the way.. fascinating people from all walks of life !",j0B11
50,Great activity with teens,Loved cycling along the cycle path by the beach - interesting views. Lovely experience but you need your wits about you to avoid people meandering along the cycle path.Cycled to Marina Del Ray for lunch ( at Tony P's which was outstanding) then a little further to a beach.Most seems along the beach side but you have to go inland on roads which can seem daunting.Wish they would hire bikes with brakes and gears rather than bikes you need to back pedal to brake.,Kate N
50,Possibly the best part of our holiday,"Cycling from Santa Monica down to Venice Beach past the amazing properties, glorious beach and array of interesting people was a huge highlight of the holiday. The kids loved the freedom and exercise and we loved basking in the sun but with the breeze of a gentle bike ride. Keep your wits about you as pedestrians don't always stick to the right paths but this was so much fun. Highly recommended especially on the weekends when it's much busier and you get to see all the locals out enjoying the route too.",Jamie H
50,Amazing bike ride!,"Riding a bike from Santa Monica to Venice Beach was an awesome experience! The path runs right along the beach and it's just beautiful. No matter where you rent your bike, doing this bike path is a must!!",twinkies
50,Best way to see Santa Monica and surrounding area,"During our stay in Santa Monica, my family and I rented bicycles. If you are planning a trip there, I can't say enough about doing the same. It's the best way to see the area. It is cost effective and you can stop and go as you like. The bike path is very safe and accommodating.",Lisa R
50,Best activity in Santa Monica,I enjoyed riding the bike path so much that I insisted we do it a second time before we left town. This trail takes you along the beach and the Pacific Ocean. You'll pass the Santa Monica Pier and the eclectic shops and people in Venice.The fun does not stop at the end of the path. The Venice canals and shopping on Abbot Kinney Blvd are not too far away by bike.,Shannon C
50,Great cycle track,"Great dedicated cycle track. You will do well to cover all 26 miles as you will want to keep stopping and see some of the many sights along the way. This is a must do activity if you are in town, views are amazing, people watching brilliant.",aitkeng
50,Jealous I Can't Use This Every Day,"Great way to get out and see the beach front area. Tons of people out so not a speed route. Can be used bikes, skates, and saw some electric skateboards. Lots of spots to get off for a bite to eat, watch volleyball, check out vendors along Venice beach, or just enjoy the breeze.",Philip L
50,incredible ride!,"We rent our bikes over at the Santa Monica Bike center on 2nd street and ride the WHOLE WAY DOWN and back. It usually takes us the day, about 4-5 hours as we stop for lunch and drinks along the way. Beautiful and easy bike path if you'd like to see the Pacific Coast a more breezy way.",Trojan_traveler13
40,Cycle by the ocean,"This is a great place to cycle, more so if you feel unsure about cycling on busy LA streets. Peaceful and lovely right next to the ocean. Lovely in any season as California beach weather is always good for cycling or walking along this beach path. One of my fave places to cycle and walk.",Lala
40,Twice on rollerblades and what a challenge,"I used to be an avid, avid rollerblader and I lived for my weekends so I could get out and go up and down the bike path. I grew up in Torrance so I knew where the bike path started but hadn't put two and two together years later, when I moved to Venice, that Venice's bike path was the same! Well frankly, all the way to Pacific Palisades practically. Anyway, I had ridden it a few times on my bike and it was an amazing trip and work out but then I was like, could I do it on rollerblades? I was in good shape, young and energetic and I was a good skater so I went for it! Getting there wasn't so tough but by the time I got all the way to the end of the path, the wind had picked up and boy, was my return harder than I could have ever imagined! My saving grace was my Walkman - you remember those don't you? I had several 'high energy' dance music 'cassettes' that I had made just for my skating expeditions and they are what got me back, barely, in one piece! Incredible memories but I couldn't do that anymore! But I dare anyone else to do it- at least once! You'll never forget it!",Aricot
50,Lots of fun,Nice activity to do with children which will cost a family of 4 about USD 100. Best time to do it is around 9:00am before it gets too warm,Permart
30,Fun cycle path along the beach,"Having been in Santa Monica many times I never did the bike path. This time we got bikes from the hotel and did the bit from Santa Monica to Venice beach. Lots of things to see on the way. Skateboard park, muscle beach in Venice and the Venice Boulevard stalls. Worth doing if you have some spare time. Better than wasting your time to seen the Santa Monica pier.",ekholland27
40,Very nice,It's actually not only a bike path. You can also walk there. very even path. easy to walk on. Beautiful ocean views. If you do choose to ride... You can bring your own bike or rent from numerous places,TREK39
50,"Get out of Beverly Hills, grab a bike and go....","Beautiful way to tour Santa Monica, Venice, almost all the way up to Pacific Palisades.Rented a bike in Santa Monica - plenty of bike centers - big cushy seats and fat tires. Easy ride a block along Ocean Ave to the Pier, go down ramp and path runs under Pier. South is Venice. North is Pacific Palisades. South is busier, but good to stop and people watch. North is quieter, but good to zen on a bike.They have these Perry's stands every half mile or so. After an hour or so of biking, a cold shake from Perry's hits the spot.Do it!",joe a

50,Nice and Flat,"This bike bath is chared by all. Bikes, skatedboards, roller bladers, joggers and walkers. You can hire just about anything to go from one end of the path to the other.",Jo H
50,Santa Monica bike ride,The cycle track gives great access to a stretch of beautiful beaches and some quiet spots once you get past Santa Monica and Venice beaches. Be aware of a section that is on a very busy four lane road and not suitable for smaller children (you could get off and push as not too long). Water stops along the route. A laid back way to explore the coast. We ran out of time and couldn't do it all - lazy start and a long stop to swim in the ocean - so plan on a full day. Bike hire $20 a day. Would highly recommend.,Jenny P
20,Overcrowded and nobody follows the rules,"Everyone wants to ride bikes on the beach, so as you can imagine it's overly crowded; the bigger problem? The people walking on the bike path. It's clearly labeled but there's no dividers that keep the walkers on their side and it causes a mess and isn't safe for bikers. So, if you're going to bike or walk on it, follow the rules and think of those around you (e.g. don't just stop in the middle of the bike path).",Sabrina P
50,A must do,A must do activity while in LA. Cruise along and enjoy. Do not forget to visit the Venice canals as well ;).,EJ070
50,Superb for Sight Seeing,Great mode of transport to visit both Santa Monica Beach and Venice Beach. Bikes were easy to rent and it was a fun ride.,NorthStar510398
40,Great bike path,"A wonderful and relaxing way to spend a day. We rode from Santa Monica to Playa del Ray (17 miles return) and the path is dedicated on beach most of the way then some cycle lanes around the marina, then back to dedicated. If you have kids then maybe stick to the beach paths. We rented bikes and locked them in various locations and walked around. Whilst the paths are dedicated for bikes, rollerbladers and some walkers will use, and be cautious of skill levels from novice cyclists, there heaps of rental bikes around and many placed to rent along the way.",Grommet22

We rode our bikes to Venice and back, stopping to see some sites along the way.The bike path was great - well maintained, wide, flat, and easy to follow.We stopped at the skateboard park to watch the kids do their tricks, at the Venice art walls for pictures, Muscle Beach, and at the Venice canals (a couple blocks off the trail).It was shocking to see so many homeless people living on the beach along the trail.",dms666
50,A must do!,Rented bikes for the day. Great family activity. If you have an inexperienced rider may want to get them a tandem bike to ride with a parent as the path can be very busy in parts.,amy d
50,fun for the family,"A lot of kids and bike rentals on this path, so you don't have to dodge the racers (too much.) It's a great way to go see Venice Beach or go north to the less populated beaches. Relaxing and fun!",83problems
50,Scenic oceanside path!,"My husband and I walked over half of this path. You see a lot of cyclists, but it is not overcrowded during the daytime. In the evening the path is fairly deserted which would make for a cool, quiet ride. There are a lot of rentals nearby if you did not bring your own wheels. I would recommend this path because it has separate walking and biking, it's clean, and you have a beautiful view of the beach and ocean.",Heather S
50,Pedalling into the sun,"This is a must. Grab a bike from Santa Monica Beach Bike Rentals, head to the pier a few blocks away and cruise along the bike path. Safe and fun. Check out the skateboard park , muscle beach and the countless cafes and eateries but don't forget to lock ya ride to something when leaving it.",mikewatso
20,"Pedestrians, race bikes, and sand dunes","I took my skateboard out for a stroll and you quickly realize the same terrible drivers of Los Angeles also own bikes. Inconsiderate people who drive in oncoming lane, racer bikes who pretend this is the Tour de France last mile, and pedestrians who can’t read the signs or pavement markings and assume it’s a sidewalk.It’s still a great ride, but be ready to run over or be run over.",redneckITengineer

My wife and I spent the morning riding the path down the coast. Easy ride-flat, breezy, and beautiful! Places to stop and eat, shop, and drink. Shops also along the way.

50,Great shared space,"This space is a shared bike and walking path, can't say we travelled the whole length and it can be pretty busy, in the shared areas and sometimes there is a separate area for bikes and pedestrians. There are lots of shops and places to stop for reception and you have to pause at Muscle Beach, if only to watch and not to try and develop your own muscles. Lots to see as you walk/cycle along.",Marion N
50,Cycling in Santa Monica ? Hop on the bike at Bergamot train stop,"The bike trail is one of my preferred routes for cycling to the ocean in Santa Monica.My starting point for the bike path is Bergamot train station (about 30 blocks away from the coast)I like this route because the elevation differences are negligible on this route. That allows for a more relaxed ride as compared to using Ocean Park for cycling down to the beach. There are some steep hills to climb on the Ocean Park route.Attention; the bike path ends at 17th and Colorado. However it is pretty ok to bike on Colorado all the way down to the ocean (about 19 blocks)Colorado takes you right to the Santa Monica Pier.I have also used the bike path to bike from Bergamot metro stop to Sawtelle, Sawtelle is a great place for eating out if you crave Japanese food.",Dee_Green15

50,Love this ride. Best of L.A.,"I think it's called the Marvin Braude Memorial Trail, I've seen his name posted along it in the past. Great bike ride most right next to the ocean. Best of the beach cities. Bike rentals in SaMo, Venice, and elsewhere along the trail. Best in the morning and weekdays. Less crowded. This is why people live in L.A.",kimo213

50,Fun bike trip,Only did the stretch from Santa Monica south to Dockweiler State beach of around 15 miles round trip going through Venice and Marina del Rey. Rental bikes are easily available and the cycling is on flat well marked paths. Pedestrians can be a hazard in busier parts but are all part of the fun. A really nice way to see the coastline,LargecatsUK
50,Fun day on southern end of path!,"We rented bikes in Hermosa Beach and rode as far as Venice Beach (about 12 miles each way). We parked in the public garage near Hermosa cyclery which was very convenient. We went on a weekday so the path wasn't very crowded and we were able to get parking. On the southern end of the path, you can also rent bikes in Redondo Beach just south of Hermosa Beach. I really enjoyed Hermosa and Manhattan Beach since you have the beach on one side and interesting homes on the other with no street crossings. Once you reach Marina Del Rey, you will be riding away from the beach most of the time until you reach Venice so that part of the ride wasn't spectacular. There's not much to eat/drink once you leave Hermosa Beach until you get to Venice so plan accordingly. We didn't continue north to Santa Monica because the ride back would have been too long. Highly recommend!",warmwinds5
30,Crowded bike path,"If I were leisurely riding a tricycle for sightseeing, this would have been a 5-star rating. It is a very busy, crowded path. But since I was riding to get to a destination, and hoping for some exercise, it rates much lower. That is NOT this path.",dawnc1967

50,Great way to explore the coast!,"If you are energetic and want to catch the true local flavor, this ride is for you.The landscape changes as you ride from one beach town to another with lots of places to stop along the way.It's best to do this early in the day. Stop for lunch once you've completed the 26th mile, then head back. Late afternoons can be very crowded and much less enjoyable through certain areas like Santa Monica and Venice. The path is narrow and many people decide to walk blocking most of the path. Be careful of children in attended running out across the path.This is a great activity any time of year.",Donna M
50,Best place to rent a bike and go for a ride along the beach,We always rent a bike(s) and bike down to Venice beach and back. The people watching is amazing and there are a few good ice cream shops. Muscle beach is a sight to see.,Dr_Farmer
50,Great safe activity. It's a must do,"Rented bikes, loved every second. Around every corner was something different (we did it on a public holiday) dead flat and safe. Take it easy and enjoy. Took 2 hrs from sm to Venice and back.",Don2156
40,Great way to take it all in,Perfect way to see Santa Monica and Venice Beach.You can go as fast as you like or just take it easy like a Sunday morning.There are plenty of places to lock your bike up if you want to take a stroll around any of the areas along the route.,Dale M
50,Great for families! Ride whatever distance you want,"We went on a Tuesday after noon. We parked in the 5th parking structure, walked down Broadway to a bike shop called Public bike shop, one street away from the pier. We promptly received well maintained bikes for two adults and one 10 year old, baskets, helmets and locks promptly for $20+ each all day. I felt safe with the bikes. We crossed one street and weren't sure at first how to access the path. You ride to the left to the wooden ramp that takes you to the boardwalk, Bubba Gump's and the Ferris wheel, etc. Everybody goes down the wooden ramp to the pier. Once you descend the ramp, on your left and tucked in the back behind yellow poles is an access to the bike bath. There are some stairs that say ""to the aquarium"". Take your bikes through the poles and go the right instead, down a path, around a corner and you will see the path that goes under the boardwalk. We went to the left and toward Venice. It didn't take long to get there. I was surprised, thinking it was much further away. We loved the bike path. We only rode a couple miles each way but it was so beautiful, clean and safe. Lots of people and scenery to observe. In Venice, we saw the skate park, arts and crafts, unavoidable marijuana accessories and art, an interesting troop that put on an impromptu comedy, ""athletic"" show, and hustled people for money. Some of the guys used rough language and racial stereotypes, so I would watch for this if you have kids. In fact, some of the shops and art work, and unsavory characters are not for younger kids. Just get back on the bike path. It is safe and separated from the shops and activities on the Venice path. You have to move off the bike trail to visit the shops, and easily get back on if you don't like what you see. Highly recommended for families. Again, if you have small kids, just don't go off the trail when in Venice. Just keep riding merrily along as far as you want, then turn around and go back to the Santa Monica pier.",Jacquelyn F
50,Busy!,"This is a great facility but you need to get out past the Marina before there's enough space to pick up a bit of speed if you're cycling for fitness. It's a cycle path but expect pedestrians strolling four across, skateboarders, rollerbladers etc and the area around Santa Monica and Venice beaches is particularly crazy. Nevertheless this is a great facility and you just need to relax, talkie in the vibe and accept that you're not going to go 35km/hr.",RobinADXB
50,A must do!,"We rented bikes in Hermosa Beach and rode to Santa Monica and back. It is super flat and easy with a beach cruiser.

50,This was fun!,"We rented bikes from Perry's and had a blast on this path. We rode all the way down to Marina Del Ray and Venice beach. Make sure you take locks so you can get off the bikes when you want to explore on your feet. It was a Sunday and the path was extremely crowded, but it was still fun.Just watch out for folks crossing the path without looking to see if you are coming. They were oblivious to the bikers which caused many near miss collisions.",Patrick W

50,Excellent idea,"We didn't know about this until we visited. The pathway is clean and tidy and well maintained. The path is used by pedestrians, bikers, skate boarders and others. It's a great way to walk at the side and see most of the beach and surrounding area.",Ianbb8
30,Wear a helmet!

50,Best of L.A,This is the must experience you need to get when you coming to L.AAs a local I still go for biking on regular bases and I think this is the best L.A can offer to Tourists as well,amirk973
40,Ride Away,"It is a flat sidewalk and you can ride for miles and miles. It runs right along beside the ocean. There are two paths, one for riding a bike, skate boarding, or roller blading. The second path is for pedestrians. I did walking on the path and was very interesting.",KYPU
50,One of my fave things to do when in LA....,"Anyone staying in LA has to head to Santa Monica and hire a bike and ride along this path.....this is our fifth time riding towards LAX and Malibu, but it was our 7 year old daughters first time riding a bike on her own...she loved it and to her credit she made it all the way around....the best place to hire bikes is under the pier, genuinely friendly, the cheapest prices and a great selection of bikes.",Ashjay40
50,It's a great bike path.,This bike path goes all the way from Palos Verdes to Pacific Palisades. Along the way you're going to have to tackle Washington Blvd. The scenery and the bike path is usually in good condition but on occasion if it gets windy or rainy it can be a little bit of a challenge. Just make sure you know how to find your way to the portion in Marina Del Rey in order to get to either end. It's a total of 26 miles. Lots of nice places along the way to accumulate a few carbs(:,Richard L

50,So much fun!!,We stayed in Santa Monica for our honeymoon and absolutely loved the bike path! We went all the way to Venice and several miles north as well. We were able to visit so many wonderful spots along the way and the hulu bikes made it so convenient and affordable. The bike path was a highlight for our trip and one of my favorite things about the area!,Michelle H
50,Simply awesome!!,"After renting bikes near the SM pier we decided to tackle the popular bike path and head to Manhattan Beach, a two hour ride!We used the trail map provided and followed this well marked trail. We passed alongside Venice Beach, stopped by the canals and headed to Marina del Ray. While the trail avoids much of the busy streets, there are parts where you ride alongside traffic but nothing too stressful. The city has done a great job with this trail and it's easy to ride. I highly recommend it for even the novice rider.The ride to Manhattan Beach takes you along the ocean for much of the trial and I suggest sunscreen and water as you will get burned. Enjoy great restaurants in Manhattan Beach, explore up the hill as well as the pier but save your energy for the ride back!This trail was definitely the highlight of my visit to Santa Monica!!",TorontoJourneyman
50,Brilliant bike path,"This got to be one of the best cycle paths I have ever seen. It is so scenic and breathtaking. It is totally level, no effort needed.

50,May 2016,"On of the best urban bike paths I have been on. Fantastic scenery, so close to the ocean and some of Santa Monica's best real estate. There are not a lot of access points from Wilshire Blvd, we had to ride down to the pier but it was well worth it. Early in the morning is best as there is not a lot of traffic, you get to share the path with joggers, roller bladers.",269leanneg
50,Ride into the beach,"I finished a 2-week bikecamping trip by taking this path from Santa-Monica to Ventura and then going to the airport. It was a wonderful conclusion to my journey. The path mostly goes right through the sand, and only occasionally along the road. It is smooth, wide and offers some views that I hadn't thought actually existed outside movies and tv-series. There are facilities like toilets and bicycle parking, and the city is only one turn away. No better way to spend a sunny spring day.",helgie8888
50,Nice beach views. Be sure to stop along the way,We rented bikes and traveled from Santa Monica to Venice beach. It is an easy pedal of 5 miles or so. We rode around the Canals in Venice.

50,So happy I did this!,"This was the perfect way to see a good stretch of Beach in a relatively short time. The weather was perfect and the bike path is well maintained. You do have to be careful of pedestrians - even though they're not supposed to walk in the bike path, they do anyway! I rode from Venice Beach, through Santa Monica Beach, to Will Rogers State Park. Make it to Will Rogers if you can -- it's only a few miles more, but the views are ten times as nice, and there are hardly any people there! Don't forget sunscreen!",Michelle R

Make sure you rent a bike with a comfortable seat, multiple gears and a bike lock. Bring water also. The path travels along the ocean except for when you get to Marina Del Ray. It's a 4-6 hour day round trip. Great day!",fredraymond522
40,Fun afternoon ride,"It was fun to ride, but areas were so crowded it was almost impossible to keep the bike upright because of such slow pedaling . There were hundreds of inexperienced riders that didn't follow normal courteous rules do the road. Foreigners surely didn't know. People riding side by side and impossible to pass at times. I did ride to the end by Venice beach and that was fun to see, again very crowded there. There were spots on the path that were very sandy and easy to slip if you weren't careful. It was fun, but very crowded. I rode in late afternoon, can't imagine what it would've been like earlier.",Jubileekeepsakes

50,Great way to see the area!,"This is a wonderful bike path and it's a great way to see the entire Santa Monica bay and all of the different communities along the way. In the Palisades it zips along the open beach. The path zig zags through the craziness that is Venice Beach. And there is beautiful parkland in Marina Del Rey. It can get crowded on the weekends, particularly around Santa Monica Pier and Venice. There are plenty of restrooms, dining spots and fun opportunities along the way.

50,Fabulous Fun!,We hired bikes from the Santa Monica pier and loved our time riding down to Venice Beach. The bike path was fantastic. Wide and easy to ride. The day we were there it was fairly busy however all the traffic on the path moved well and it was easy to hop to the side and take photos along our way or simply to stop and take in sights.

50,Eclectic to Suave this has something for all,"This path runs along Santa Monica and Venice. There is absolutely no doubt when you shift from one to the other. Santa Monica is pristine and clean, Venice is eclectic and crazy. The path is smooth and well designed so as not to conflict bikers with runners/walkers. You pass by the Santa Monica pier, gymnasts, lively street performers and one of the prettiest beaches around. It was pretty windy each day, but this is a must do if you are down in that area.",C K

50,Not to be missed!,"We enjoyed our ride from Santa Monica up to Venice Beach and Marina del Rey very much. We rented a bike for the whole day and took our time, which you have to anyway, as the path is used by many many people. Bikers, walkers and rollerbladers all share the same path so drive carefully and pay attention to others.",Lolo-to-be

50,Pedaling through Beauty and Entertainment,Rent a bike right on the walking path. Walk your bike to the bike path and pedal through the beauty and culture of Santa Monica! So many people to observe and the beauty of the ocean and beach. The path is flat easy riding. Even when it's a bit crowed people are pretty considerate and you will see that people ride anything on a wheel or wheels. Its an amazing way to spend a few hrs on a beautiful day.,NYCtraveler62
50,Beautiful and Relaxing... and Weird,"Well-maintained bike path that stretches along the Pacific coast. We walked about 4 miles of the path and had a lovely time despite sketchy weather. People doing yoga on the sides and lots of bikes, scooters and skateboards zipping by. As it stretches into Venice Beach, be sure to check out the bodybuilders, the skatepark, and all the bizarre sights to behold. Really nice afternoon.",eluper

50,Great ride - but know before you go------,"Great experience. Once rode from Santa Monica south to Venice then north to end of trail and back to SM in November and early March from Santa Monica south past LAX to about 8 miles from south end of trail. Great ride but you need to know a) Santa Monica to Venice section can be crowded which will slow your pace and can be annoying b) pedestrians routinely ignore the ""bicycles only"" signs on the path out of ignorance,arrogance or both - worst offenders on SM to Venice stretch. c) At Venice pier you leave the oceanfront path, travel east on Washington Avenue (real cear/truck traffic), after first block in a marked bike lane, proceed to Midred, make a right to rejoin bike/walking path, circle perimeter of Marina del Ray (follow signs through parking lots across streets etc) and end up back on beach side path. d) about 1 mile from Marina del Rey, with right wind, planes will be taking off directly over your head as LAX runways end shortly before the beach. There are mile markers painted on the path and plenty of public restrooms and water fountains along the way. Check wind direction before you start - headwinds on ride back were a challenge and while fairly level grade, seemed to be generally ""uphill"" going north.",78chevy
50,Every Time I Go!,"I love this so much, it's a total must-do. Very inexpensive to rent bikes for a couple of hours, ride past interesting homes, scenic beaches, and interesting dog-walkers, cyclists, skate-boarders, and others. Cruising at a leisurely pace makes it easier to observe everything and everyone around you, but I've enjoyed getting aerobic too.",Mauibeth
50,Must Do!,Rollerblading/ biking along side the ocean is an experince you must have! This activitie is good for anyone and everyone at any age.,jacosta2678
50,Beautiful,This is one of the most beautiful beach bike paths. Going in two directions it goes towards Venice Beach and in the opposite direction Pacific Palisades. Mainly flat this road has amazing views of the Pacific Ocean but is only accessible by the California Incline and the highway off to the side. So if you don't want to hear the highway later on going towards Pacific Palisades this is not the right bike path for you.,Levi Miller
50,Who needs the gym when you've got an oceanside bike/run path?,Great way to get a workout along the beach. During our stay there was a half marathon going on. Fun people and dog watching along the beach.,buytravelnotstuff

50,A Great Family Bike Ride,"This is a wonderful path along the ocean from Venice to Malibu where you can walk, or bike ride or just people watch.It is one of the great joys of visiting Santa Monica.Be sure to watch the sunset from the walk!",baldac76
50,A WORKOUT BUT TOTALLY WORTH IT,Its one of the best bike rides I've ever been on. The scenery along the path is amazing. The best time to do it is mid day so you can see the sun set as well. We were fortunate enough to see dolphins swimming as we progressed along the path. There are restaurants along the way that you can stop for to eat. The downside of the path is that it takes a while to do so I recommend you go early if you plan on riding there and back.,358esaur
50,"Great exercise, then food!!","We do this ride numerous times over the summer. Start in Playa del Ray and ride to Hermosa Beach. Have breakfast, walk around a bit and ride back. It takes about 3 hrs total and is a great way to enjoy a summer's day.",Caryn C
40,Great experience with lots of variety,"The bike path was great fun, providing a wide variety of sights and experiences from beach boardwalk to canal neighborhoods to quirky/funky/creepy Venice Beach to industrial yacht brokerage areas and 7-figure beachfront residences. Added bonuses along the way are surfer-watching, a few locations near El Segundo (Dockweiler Beach) where you will come across several beached and abandoned boats, LAX flights taking off right over your heads in one area, and the variety of smaller, more charming areas like Manhattan Beach and Hermosa Beach with some great outdoor seating restaurant options. We rode 26 all level miles RT at a leisurely pace with lots of stops, away from traffic 90% of the time, ate lunch outside at Hermosa Beach, and were back in under 5 hours. There are some fairly long straight unchanging sections between Venice Beach and Manhattan Beach. A terrific way to spend a sunny day and really get a flavor for the area! Because it was close to our hotel, we rented bikes at Perry's, a beachfront place about a mile S of the Santa Monica pier, and regretted it because the rates were higher and the equipment was garbage. Rent at one of the bike shops a few blocks in from the beach, of which there are several great options.",Steve D
50,Amazing,We rented the green hulu city bikes (using the sobi [social bicycles] app). It's $7 per hour. We cycled some of this and really enjoyed it. Lots to see and do on the route as well if you want to stop. A nice gemtle pretty much entirely flat route.,Ali G

20,scenic ride needs better upkeep,we rode from santa monica pier to venice beach. it was wonderful to see the beach so full of activity. the bike path was covered in sand in 6 laces which made it a struggle for many of the tourists. there were a considerable number of homeless.It would not take much effort for someone to shovel the sand.,martinray2016

50,Best bike ride in LA,We have bike ride this path about a dozen times and it never gets old. Start birth at the volleyball courts gen ride south to Santa Monica pier then south to Venice beach and Venice area. It gets a little dicey in Marina del Rey since you have to ride in the streets with cars. So not good for anyone younger than a teen at that section. Bring cash to buy snacks and drinks along the way. The Bike Shops will give you free air or repairs if you get stuck.,Marie R
50,Sunday morning bike ride,We borrowed the bikes from our hotel (Le Meridian Santa Monica) and it was only a few blocks down the the bike path. The path is easily navigated from the pier down to Venice Beach where you have to go on the road a little bit and then pick it back up to go towards Marina Del Ray. We rode down to see the marina and then on our way back we took a detour to see the canals before heading back to the path. There are plenty of restaurants to stop at along the path and bike racks to stop and lock up your bike to explore on foot. Definitely a great way to see this part of the coast. It's an easy flat ride.,Melissa B

40,This is a must but be careful around Washington Blvd,This is a lovely half day trip. As a keen road cyclist at home in Australia I love to get out on bike and this trail is perfect for touring even though the southern section from Marina Del Ray to Huntingdon Beach is increasingly peppered with serious road cyclists! (Be careful as they don't take prisoners on corners!!)My suggestion would be to start at Santa Monica but curtail the trail to the small bridge that crosses the canal at Marina Del Ray and then work back to Venice Beach and stop for Brunch at Simmy's. This is a gem with very eclectic menu and great service. Make sure to stop at the skate park at Venice to marvel over the talented teens and tots performing amazing tricks!,SRM

40,Fun For All Bikes,"We rented bikes from a rental shop just off the Santa Monica Pier. It was a better deal than the city bike share program that charges per hour because we kept the bikes for 4+ hours and also my friends got a tandem bike (under $40, flat fee).We rode from Santa Monica Pier to Venice Beach to Marina Del Rey before turning around just before the Pacific Avenue Bridge. The ride was leisurely, not a difficult course, and there's plenty of opportunity to walk and stop around Venice Beach to look at shops and stuff going on -- we watched a Harlem Globetrotters event filmed at one of the basketball courts for ESPN. Even in December, there were lots of people out but the trail wasn't too crowded.Highly recommend it -- I'd like to finish the rest of the trail someday.",CYPhung

We stayed in Venice and rode bikes on this path to Santa Monica which only took about ten minutes. Much faster than traveling by car looking for parking and paying to park. Their are city bike rentals that you can get about a block away and return just about anywhere. This path goes along the beach with unobstructed views on the beach and ocean. Have roller blades or skates bring them with you, this path is great for all foot commuters.",Airaddict
50,Unbelievable!,"Stayed in South Bay for a week and rode this every day. From SM to Redondo Beach is 26 miles of well-maintained, easy riding, multi-purpose trail along the beach. Adjacent to Marina del Rey, there is a connecting trail along the canal that goes inland for many more miles--good news: lots of underpasses to avoid surface traffics, bad news: lots of underpasses to scale. We weren't going to bring our bikes but did on second thought and found this to be a delightful trail--one of the best!",beeedell
50,Tops,"We picked up our bikes from SM Bike Center. They have plenty of options to get riders and non riders going. We rode SM pier to Venice Pier return. Everyone on the path and the beach and it's many activities were all cool, aware of people around them, and a great vibe the length of our ride. The path was clean and busy. We were out 4hrs but we stopped for lunch at a Venice Hotel (bike chain/locks provided by SM BC). When we got to the Venice Beach area (and you will know when you do) when got off the bike path and rode with the pedestrians. Plenty of other bike riders were also and no pedestrians seem to mind.

30,Travel Insurance,"Ok people if you are going to do this ride make sure you have travel insurance....When I did it 27 Sep 16 the path leaving Santa Monica had a lot of sand on it making it very slippery and a lot of tourists that have not been on a bike in years are on the wrong side of the path making it even more dangerous. As for the ride itself you get to see a lot of homeless a very dirty Venice beach and a few weird people doing exercise along the beach gyms, not like the movies AT ALL. Other than that a pleasant ride with the beach off to one side. Tip, ensure you check the bike out before you ride off, they will make you pay if anything breaks.",E47

It was so easy to jump from one beach town to the next and really get a flavor of the area. Want to pop up to the pier? Easy. The paths are nicely marked so that bikers and walkers aren't going to run into each other (so long as the walkers stay off the bike path...haha).

50,Great biking!,"We rented bikes and rode from Santa Monica pier to Marina del Rey. What a glorious way to see the ocean -- along with all the crazy stuff in Venice Beach. Along the way we saw singers, old guys playing paddle tennis and dozens of surfers. The bike paths are wide, well-maintained and separated from pedestrians. Plenty of places to rent from and prices are all competitive ($30/day, including helmet). No need to worry if you have water or snacks because there are hundreds of vendors. We had a glorious day -- and just stopped and gazed at the waves for awhile. Do not feel you need to go all 26 miles (we didn't) or need to be in great shape (we're in our 60s). This is about as easy as bike travel gets...with an ever-changing landscape that is unique in America. Make this a priority...you won't regret it.",Bonnie R

From that point you head south and follow the bike path through Culver City and down to Manhattan Beach, Redondo Beach I'm all the way to Palos Verdes.",Richard L

A perfect way to spend a morning, not hot afternoon or early evening!",Chris Herche
40,fun experience,"the beach is very large, if you're visiting, it is a great idea to rent a bike and bike along the beach. there's plenty of the bike parking pole if you want to stop by at certain distance, it's a bit confusing when you bike from the bike rental shop to the actual bike path. the sign is not very obvious and there's lots of people and tourists around.",ppjj8
40,Worth doing.,"Got on our bicycles and off we went, wobbly at first but it's like riding a bike!

50,Great Bike Path,I have been riding on path for years. It is great because it follows along the ocean the entire way. You get to go by many different towns that give you a good overview of the area. It is will maintained but look out for the people walking on the path especially in Santa Monica and Venice. So either for a workout or sightseeing the path is a good ride.,Kent B
50,Perfect for a long distance runner,"I would think for bikers 26 miles isn't enough, but I love this path for my long distance runs. When I am in the area for the job, and preparing for a marathon, I don't think twice, this path is my favorite for long runs (3/4 marathon).",Belgianrunner

40,BEST BIKE RIDE OF YOUR LIFE!,"I am not one of the most physically active people in the world so when my better half mentioned this 26 mile bike path I envisioned an endles crowded sandy path under a searing sun, pain, a lot of sweat and harsh breathing. I came up with some world class excuses to get out of going but guess who lost the argument? So Saturday morning came, we rolled our dusty bikes out of the garage and headed towards the trail. Once I accepted the fact that this was happening I did my best to enjoy myself. One of the nice things about Santa Monica and a lot of Southern California is that they have bike lanes on almost all of the major streets. I mean, you can pretty much go anywhere you want without worrying about getting in the way of traffic or getting bumped off your bike and that was the case on the way to the trail. Just FYI, for those of you that are visiting and want to experience the path, there are countless bike rental places all along the boardwalk especially in and around Santa Monica which is also right next to the path. They're all, for the most part, very affordable and surprisingly comfortable. In addition, depending on where you choose to rent, they offer bike trailers for your kids and tandem bikes if you want to give that a whirl. The path itself is designed exclusively for bicycle riders even though you're sue to encounter people walking on it anyways but because there's also a pedestrian trail that parallels the bike path that isn't really a problem. Now here's the cool part. A good amount of the trail runs right along the beach and ocean with the mountains as a backdrop. Absolutely beautiful. AND because you are right next to the ocean, there's always a nice breeze to keep you comfortable even if it is a little warmer than you'd like. On top of that, there are a ton of shops and restaurants along the way. If you're a people watcher this is where you want to be. Quite the diverse crowd everywhere you look. The day we went there was a guy playing a grand piano right next to the beach. He was dressed in cutoff jeans and t-shirt but he played beautifully. I still can't figure out how he got that piano out there but there he was. We also passed a pretty elaborate skateboard park and the young people were simply amazing to watch. The trail itself was smooth with very little ups and downs or sand on it but I would suggest that you take it a little slow when riding around any bends, just in case. As far as what to bring besides yourselves? If you're planning an all-dayer then a backpack, some sunscreen, a couple bottles of water, a ball cap and maybe even a sweatshirt or light jacket depending on the time of year.To summarize, I have to admit that I was wrong about the trip being more work than it was worth (although it would take wild horses to get me to admit it to you know who). I highly recommend it as a great way to see a lot of natural beauty, interesting people and just plain fun. Safe travels",Joe S
50,Inspiring path,"This path makes you want to walk further, run faster or bike longer. Beautiful scenery along the beach. Lots of others around you to push you a little further without being too crowded. Must see while in Santa Monica.",Chad R
50,Great cycle paths,Santa Monica has great cycle paths and is an excellent way to get around this busy area to see the sights. Highly recommend.,Janice H
50,great activity,Bikes are cheap to hire (at Venice beach and Santa Monica pier anyway) and the ride is interesting and good fun,verluisant
40,Great afternoon activity,"A fun adventure - rent a bike in a number of places along the path and get some exercise and people watching in. The path can be busy (pay attention!) but totally worth the ride. Lots of options to stop and rest on the beach, hit a playground, shop or get a bite to eat.",Kirstin B
50,Now this is how riding on holiday should be,What a great initiative to have this amazing infrastructure available to use. I registered for a social bikes membership and jumped on a hoku bike and explored the coastline.Well maintained and the pedestrians in general are well behaved and stay out of the way (as they are not meant to be on the bike path).I rode relatively flat areas and loved the feeling of riding right next to the ocean.,Sue B
50,Enjoyed our Ride,We rode from SM to Venice! We rented bikes just North of the pier with Social Bicycles. Download the app early to save some time. Nice clean path with lots of stops if you choose to do so! We saw a lot of security and never worried about safety.,Tina Y
40,Beautiful paved stroll,"Santa Monica has been a leader in bike paths. The sidewalks which cater to bikers and walkers alike, provide a smooth (sometimes sandy) ride along the shoreline. A beautiful ride but beware of pedestrian traffic especially in the crowded summer months.",shilltravel
50,So good,So easy to hire bikes so much fun very easy cycling all beautifully organized this is a very fun experience,LondonWiggies
40,Loved it!,"We were there at the end of March. Rented 2 bikes and biked a good amount of the trail (but not all) its a great ride! You have the ocean on one side of you, and the life of Venice and Santa Monica on the other side. Lots of places to stop and see. Whether it be the shops or the water. The path is paved and separated for direction. I would definitely do this again!",Chelcey3
50,Great people watching,"We walked to 3 miles from Vince Beach to the Santa Monica pier and back. We were tired for sure, but the margaritas at the end of the pier helped! There are so many different things to do, biking, roller blading, skate boarding, etc.I enjoyed my time here and I believe you can go from Malibu all the way to Manhattan Beach on this path.",CWaters41
40,Great way to see Santa Monica and Venice,"Rent a bike and travel along the bike path to get a real feel for the area. Rent a Hulu bike in Santa Monica, ride all the way into Venice. Eat in Venice and Uber back to Santa Monica. A good day of sightseeing - be careful of the sand that can accumulate on the bike path.",Mb L
50,One of my favorites,This is a fun bike path. lots to see and you get to bike along the beach. Just be sure to have water. It can get quite warm. There is a nice and reasonably priced bike shop near the pier.,Gardenlover31
40,Excersize with beach views!,"Rented bikes to experience a bit of California weather and feel its' beach vibe so we rode from Santa Monica to Venice beach,though it was a Friday afternoon and there were throngs of tourists with a good contingent of locals as well we still found it enjoyable with one slight negative issue but I don't want to rate on that,that would be a bit unfair. Regarding that issue it concerns some of the merchants who line Venice selling souvenirs and casual beach wear... buyer beware,there are some who try to scam the unsuspecting tourist by offering deals and wording offers in such a way as to trick customers in to spending much more than they planned,just make sure that all prices are displayed and any additional costs are given consideration before committing to a purchase,be very wary!Other than that other slightly negative issues are the many homeless that inhabit parts of Santa Monica and Venice,it's disconcerting for some to deal with them but others might look at it a bit differently and see that in effect they do add some local colour to the scene. Another issue is that on busy days the less courteous cyclists seem to be most annoying.All of that being said,it is a wonderful path connecting some of the most well known beaches of the Los Angeles area,and a very enjoyable way to do excersize.Another good point that I found is that bike rentals are not so expensive. I just wish I had more time to cycle all the way tp complete what I've called the Los Angeles Beaches!",ARodriguezP

50,A must do!,"It's a great way to get around the coast and see/ hear/ smell/ experience everything along the stretch. Rent a bike from any bike rental places nearby (they should be pretty cheap, at about $8/h if I remember correctly) and cruise along the coast. It was one of my favourite activities - if there's one thing you need to do, it's this!",rrrebekah
50,"Ride, Roll, Run or Walk","I would guess I've racked up more than 20,000 miles on this path over the last 20 years! I LOVE this path! Whether you bike ride, rollerblade, walk with your dog or just come down and take a little stroll on your way to the beach for some sunbathing this is a great way to see the beautiful coast and all of the funky beach towns from Redondo Pier to the Pacific Palisades! Lots of rental and snack shops along the way along with easy parking.",SleepersGourmet
50,Amazing bike path,"Stunning views all along the bike path. Regularly rode from Marina Del Rey to Santa Monica, also cycling along Venice Beach. Be aware of people walking along the path, even though there is a designated walk ways, especially if pushing buggies. Great to just stop off along the path to visit different area.",Caroline O
40,Great exercise,"It's a great way to get exercise with fresh air from the beach. If you don't have a bike, there are many bike rental places. I paid $8 an hour. It's not crowed at the north end, above Santa Monica. Very crowded around Venice Beach.",DoctorDerm1
50,Do it everyday your not working,Watch out for peeps walking across the path do it early mornings and sunset. And enjoy the views the smells and you always bump into someone you know.,Karlsound
40,Great cycle path on beach,Such fun to cycle along the beach for miles. Unfortunately got flat tyre miles from rental shop on Santa Monica beach. Rental shops need to be checked for standards as breaks didn't fully work. Bike was extremely old. The bike rental business is a real rip off. Check your bike thoroughly before leaving.,Visi2rs
40,Nice way to kill an hour.,This is a nice way to see the beach. Although you have to watch for people just drifting into the Bike path on everything but bikes :),Grabul
50,A great activity!,"I would highly recommend taking a bike, roller skates or skateboard down the bike path as it's a really fun way to get some exercise in a beautiful location. You'll see all of SM and Venice Beach this way too!",abigailalicex
50,Wide and roomy,"With a long layover at LAX, we rented a car and took some time to explore. While at Santa Monica we took a stroll on the bike path. I live in the B&A rails to trails bike trail. The amount of room on the bike path here is great. They have lanes painted, not that they follow them all the time and no one gives a passing warning. But along the path they have many stops for other exercise you can do. Tarzan Rope swings, pull up bars, swing sets for little ones but saw many big kids using them also. Lined with Palm trees and sand on both sides. It is picturesque and a smooth ride. Enjoy.",JRSears
40,Bike!!!,"The Marvin Braude Bike Trail, also known asThe Strand, is a paved bicycle path that runs mostly along the Pacific Ocean shoreline inLos Angeles County, California.[1][2] The northern terminus of the trail is a paved Class 1 bicycle path at Will Rogers State Beach inPacific Palisades, Los Angeles. The southern terminus of the trail is in Torrance County Beach in Torrance. The path is 22 miles (35 km) long, and the midpoint between the two ends of the path is near the southern end of the Playa del Rey residential area.The Strand was officially renamed in 2006 for Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braudeand dedicated by State Senator Sheila Kuehl.[3][4]The Strand is not considered a ""boardwalk"" because it is not made out of wood boards.",Antonello M
40,Great fun,We cycled from Santa Monica pier down to the end of the path just past Venice beach. Great way to see the beaches and the skatepark. Quite a few homeless along Venice beach but didn't seem to be bothering anyone.,George C
50,Love it,"Grab your bio, your rollerblades. Your shoes. It's along the beach. It's busy. It's full of beautiful fit people. Some areas have fun stuff to stop and see. Entertainers. Skatepark. Muscle beach. Lots of fun",Vanps3
50,Santa Monica to Venice Beach,"I highly recommend renting a bike and riding it along the bike path. We went from the Santa Monica Pier to Venice Beach around 5 pm. One thing to beware of is that at the end of the day, sand has migrated onto the path so it makes for more challenging bike riding. Going the other direction from the Pier might not be as crowded either.",luvtotravel903
50,walk the bike path,"We did not cycle the 26 mile bike track but do the long walk from Marina Del Rey through Muscle beach all the way to Santa Monica beach and pier which is the end of the famous route 66 tour.Every body uses the bike path, bikers ,skate boarders and even walkers taking in the sights along the way.",SUSAN H
50,Wow !,"Loved it . Immense fun. You can hire all sorts of bikes, skates and boards at several spots along the route. If you can ride a bike, do this !",Angela S
50,California Bike Riding,Loved this experience. A great way to spend a morning checking out the different locations. Grab a bike basket and lock so you can stop along the way.,Vivienne W
40,Great for Biking,"This path is very scenic and most importantly very flat. We rented bikes while staying in Santa Monica and rode on this trail daily. I also rented a cart for the kids to sit in that I towed behind the bike. It was great exercise and a great way to get around the best part of the city. It doesn't take much to bike from Santa Monica all the way down to Marina Del Mar, there are plenty of great stops along the way. This is a must do while staying in Santa Monica",DamnRodgers

50,Bike for miles,"The bike path is excellent, flat, easy to ride along and well marked out. You can cycle for hours, iwent all the way to Manhattan beach on it and you can go even further if you've got the energy.",helendixon357
50,One of a kind bike trail,"I ride this trail with my wife and daughter from the Santa Monica pier to the Venice Pier and back for a total of 6.10 miles.It is a winding trail along the beach with dedicated bike lanes but much of the way you share the trail with skaters, runners, and so forth. We rode about 10am on a Sunday and the trail was moderately crowded but easily navigable. There are ample places to rent bike in both Venice and Santa Monica.Why this ride is so special is the trail runs parallel to the ocean with nothing but sand between you and the water most of the way. You can soak in the cool surroundings as you ride along.",AlexanderD
50,Very cool!,Great way to see the beachfront with miles of bike path. Great place to rent a bike and discover the area at your leisure. My family lived this bike path. So much fun!,FirstClass001
50,Bike anywhere with local rentals!,Rented a bike several times as I did not rent a car. Rode all the way to Manhattan Beach and up the coast as well. Beautiful ride.,Peyt36
50,Flat path but crowded,"Rented fix speed bikes and biked from Venice to Santa Monica Beach. The path can be crowded, we ave 10mph. Folks do stop for taking pics, walker and runner can be in the way too. Its a great path for casual stroll.",ZFoodieMSP

40,Fun!,We got bikes with our rental but you can hire them cheaply on the front. The cycle path is really flat and very easy to cycle even for small children or older folks- I am not fit and despite the hot day it was an easy ride.We stopped off by the Venice Beach houses to look at the canals- we locked our bikes on the beach to a lamp post got ice creams and went for a wander- easier than taking bikes with you as there are steps and the canal path is quite narrow.Then we had a wander and cycled more.You can go as far or as little as you want and if you go late afternoon it is less busy and the sun set is beautiful,allotment1
40,The Marvin Braude Bike Trail Rocks!!!,"This smooth and easy to cruise concrete bike path, which extends for miles along the coastline in LA County, is right on the beach and sandwiched between the ocean and beautiful, unique and mostly contemporary homes (in some areas). Along the path are plenty of restrooms, some restaurants/food vendors, and easy access to bordering towns. There is also a steady cool breeze. Of course, you can always pull over to take a break from biking and take a dip in the ocean, relax on the beach, play a game of volley ball, explore nearby shops, walk to the edge of the pier and/or utilize one of the many fire pits on the beach. For the most part, the trail is flat save few exceptions, and while there is a power plant and/or waste station and some slightly less desirable areas along the way, the foregoing did not detract from the overall amazing and invigorating experience. Don't forget to wear sunblock, bring bike locks, rent a bike with a basket, and bring towels!!!",TravelerDSS
50,this is what SoCal is about!,"A great way to enjoy the best of Southern California. Rent or borrow a bike (there's path-adjacent rental shops along the way). We like to start in Torrance and ride to Playa del Rey for lunch--especially love going under the LAX flight path for amazing sonic-accented views of the Pacific. The path is flat, swept and divided for two-way bike traffic and pedestrians. You can cruise leisurely, speed for exercise or make frequent stops for food or swimming. Perfect anytime of year!",ViviGo2
40,Great way to take in Venice Beach!,"We spent 2 weeks on a family holiday in Marina deal Rey and rode on the cycle path up past Santa Monica pier most days. The scenery is beautiful, of course. Although the path is meant for cycles only in some parts, you wind up sharing it with pedestrians. Just call out to them ""on your left"" as you approach (or ring a bell if your bike has one) and they'll usually step aside.",Alison T
40,Easy Rider,"A must do for casual riders and first time guests. It can get crowded so go early in the day and mid-week. Santa Monica pier north to Will Rogers will work up a little sweat, as will Marina del Rey south to Redondo Beach. Warning! The Progressive era freak show in path's Venice Beach midsection is not for every family.",DoYork

50,Must do to visit beach area in LA,"The path is dedicated to bikes, pedestrians have another one. It offers an amazing ride with great views of Santa Monica, Venice Marina del Rey, ... beaches. Nice stops on the way such as the roller coasters park, the Venice beach street. We continued up until the Venice Canal Walkway and Abbot Kinney shops, Main street shops and then back to the Bike Center. Beautiful ride of 2 hours.",Tanmouss

50,Favourite activity,"We always wanted to ride bikes here and took advantage riding between Santa Monica and Venice Beach . Great fun for most of ride just to watch what is going on , which is everything! Most of path stays clear for cyclists but occasionally , especially in Venice Beach it doesn't so you have to have your wits about you. Entertaining though . Just do it !",Chris&Janey
50,Great way to take in all the sights,We rented bikes from J's Rental in Venice Beach on the day of our arrival and the morning of our departure. We pedaled about 4 miles north and about a mile south of VB. Saturday morning was the best with everyone out doing some sort of sport.,SATXKen
40,A nice ride,"This bike path offers a nice ride. pedestrians have their own area to walk so as not to get in your way, but they don't always follow that , so be careful. Parts of this ride pass through beach areas, but others parts, such as the part through Venice Beach, can get very crowded. You will have to drive slower. It is a great way to see the coast, beaches, and unique areas like muscle beach.",Susan R
50,Great ride from Washington St in Marina Del Rey to Malibu!,"The 26 mile bike path ends or begins at the end of Washington St. in Marina Del Rey and runs parallel, well almost, to the walking path where you will find interesting vendors in Venice, several Perry's Cafes on the sand with not the cleanest restrooms, but a great playground for children. If you ride on the walking path you could be fined by the police, so walk your bike on the walk path!Bike rentals including ones for those who are mobility challenged are found in Santa Monica, Venice, and Marina Del Rey on the walk path, and a few near Perry's Cafe in Santa Monica and Venice Beach, where there is also beach parking. If you are staying at Shutters on the Beach they have cool beach cruisers for their guests. Bike locks are necessary as is a credit card to rent.There are several places besides Perry's to stop for a break along the way. The best places to take a break with children would be on the Pier in Santa Monica or further up at the Annenberg Community Center. There is enough to keep them entertained and the restrooms are relatively clean, although I'd pack wet wipes, hand sanitizers, and seriously try not to sit down.... lol. There are gazillions of visitors every year and while they are cleaned and sanitized often, seat protectors are not provided in the public restrooms. So beware!The restaurant at Annenberg Community Center, is on the sand has indoor and outdoor seating with umbrellas and a walk up snack bar. Annenberg Community Center offers tours of Marion Davies beach pad, a community swimming pool (fee charged), free splash water pad, children's playground, clean restrooms, benches in shady areas, and a nice place to relax and take a break.If you have mobility issues, there is a nice walkway out to the sand with a bench at the end for those in wheelchairs or non beach attire. And if you wish to order in advance they have beach wheelchairs and a concierge who will pack a beach picnic lunch and set up / break down it for you. You would need to arrange it through the Perry's Cafe that is closest to Annenberg Community Center. There is also conference and party rooms & parking.I haven't ventured much further than Annenberg, but it's a nice ride into Malibu. It's breezy and fun, a bit chaotic though Venice because of excessive sand on the bike path in some areas (may be seasonal) and many foreign visitors tend to walk onto the bike path instead of the walking path, although clearly marked, so you would need to slow down. In Santa Monica the bike path goes underneath the Pier, if you wish to see the pier, it's easier to walk the bike on the walk path once you reach the SandPiper and Lowes Hotels, you'll see the bike racks right away and not have to backtrack.Once past Annenberg you should be able to pick up speed. This is where many biking club members ride like the wind super fast, so if you are just a day rider out for a beach cruise I'd not venture on the path or get in their way. At those speeds someone could get hurt. Be safe and wear a helmet, check your rear view mirror often and watch out for the sand on the bike path, it makes tires super slippery and I've seen a few painful spills by riders going too fast on curves even those riding recumbent three wheelers.Those curves look like they are no big deal and then someone hits the pavement. If someone is too close behind you it's a pile up and not fun.So be safe and have a great time. It really is fun, but just pedal smart and wear a helmet!",L B
50,family fun,rented bikes from vendor close to Santa Monica Pier - hourly rate with $25 a day maximum - close to bike path..Got a tandem bike for me and my 11 year old to ride. Rode the quiet path to the north first and stopped at the ocean with a public restroom and shower and bike lock area to rinse off. Then rode south to Venice Beach - much busier this direction. Stopped for ice cream in Venice and Muscle Beach before returning bikes,angielesan
50,Fun,Its a great way to see all the beach. Bike a must.Its a fun but busy. Its quite a long path so you need a bike as its too hot to walk all the way.,YorkshireSusie
50,A must,"The whole family loved the ride both north and south of Santa Monica pier. Not sure if it is 26 miles long as it ended as far as we could see south of Venice beach and as you get near LAX, however no complaints as the beach there is great.North towards Malibu is also a worthwhile ride which is quieter and the cycle path is closer to the ocean as you travel north.Agree with other comments regarding peds not respecting the 'bike only' signs, but a small gripe.",Besty_11
50,Easy ride,"Love the smooth ride and interesting scenery - Wish all the walkers would read the BIKES ONLY signs everywhere though! Definitely the best activity for our family - great way to see Muscle Beach - new and original, shops and eateries in Venice, and even rode on further south through the neighborhoods through Venice. Would love to travel further north next time - might bring a little bell as well.",Shelly S

50,A lovely path,This cycle path is great. It goes along the beach and is a great way to cycle between places like Santa Monica and Venice beach. It can be busy but just take your time and go at your own pace. Walkers on it can get in the way and this can be frustrating. I did a cycle on this path every morning i was in the LA. Great thing to do.,Centre p
50,Fun day!,Hired bikes from Santa Monica Beach Bicycle rentals as recommended on trip advisor and had a great time cycling from Santa Monica to Venice Beach. Lovely to bike along and take in all the views. Don't forget to make a stop at Muscle Beach to see the guys working out and the skateboarders further along are good to stand and watch. We also walked our bikes around the Venice canals which are beautiful. An easy enjoyable ride.,Jayne1904

50,Great Family Activity in Santa Monica,Loved hiring the bikes and cycling from Santa Monica down past Marina Del Rey which took about an hour. Hired the bikes from next to the pier for $7 per hour. We were given a map and some advise about where to stop to eat and off we went. The route is pretty flat and you don't have to be too fit. Cycled past Venice and muscle beach which were great to see. A great family activity but do it early before it gets too hot.,YorkMark
40,Soaking in the sunshine and beach breeze,"I heard about the famous bike path from friends recommending this as a 'must do' in LA and if you are visiting Santa Monica area. So I decided to rent a bike at Santa Monica Beach Bike on 5th street - make sure you check the bike before you take off, no deposit required, just leave your driver license there, pay when you return. It's about $15-20 a day ($10 after 4pm which I recommend, the sunset is around 8:30pm so you have plenty of time to explore, it's also less burning hot if you are visiting in the middle of summer, bring enough water!)It is not easy to ride to the beach from the rental place (better walk it - especially heaps of people in the middle of the road trying to catch pokemon) but after you reach the bike path it's much easier. Very flat, easy, pleasant ride, sometimes have to watch out for people crossing unexpectedly or bikers racing or skaters passing you fast. You can still take your own speed and enjoy the scenery as much as you can. The bike rental place also provides a lock so if you wish to stop at any place just lock up your bike in the nearby station. We did a ride and a few stops from Santa Monica beach to Venice beach, return in 3 hours. The ride itself I think is just under 1.5 hours.We visited on a Sunday, definitely more crowded than weekdays (so try to avoid weekend if you can). Parking is frustrating and can be expensive. Try take public transport (the blue bus) or uber in. Cheapest parking nearby is on 5th street (next to Citi Bank) $8 per day. Some along the beach can go up to $16 a day.Definitely worth going as a couple, group of friends or even just by yourself.",Monica T
50,Great fun!,Rent a bike and you'll see so much more while riding past different places along the beach. The bike path is a little busy in the busier towns so just be careful and be mindful of other cyclists and watch your children are safe if you've got any. Would highly recommend!,domgreen93
50,A Great Part of LA,"You can bike on paths (with a few street detours) from Pacific Palisades to almost Redondo Beach - its fantastic. Its flat, but on windy days its like climbing the steepest hill. If you get tired of flat, save your energy and climb Palos Verdes at the end.",Surfarizona
50,A great bike path!,This bike path runs all the way from Pacific Palisades down to the Palos Verdes Peninsula along the Santa Monica and Southbay beaches. In order to do the whole bike path you're going to have to ride on the streets for a little while I think the best thing to do is get a map so you totally understand how to do the whole bike-path. If you want to do the shorter version you're going to go from the Venice pier to the end by to Temescal Canyon or you can go from Marina Del Rey all the way to the Palos Verdes Peninsula.,Richard L
40,Always recommended,"A must if you are in Santa Monica or Venice beachEnjoy strolling on a bike pat that will take you aOMT the beach from the Santa Monica Pier and the Venice Beach PierYou'll get a chance to hit the bars and shops around the area,Keep in mind that Venice us ""colorful"" and you'll find the good, the bad and the ugly...",Jimmychild
50,Great bike path for any level fitness,From Santa Monica you can go either north for - few miles which is nice and quiet or south down to Venice beach (busy) and beyond. It's a nice wide path good for any level fitness. You can rent bikes anywhere or right at the pier and go as little or as far as you want. There are many places to rent the Hulu bikes however I would recommend renting regular bikes from a rental place. My friend rented the Hulu and it's a little heavier so a little harder to bike.,Helena6040
40,Well worth it if you have the time.,"Great way to see what its like to live like a local. You can rent bikes at various places, and that's what I recommend. If you want to see a lot of beach, head out towards Malibu. But, I recommend heading toward Venice. It's more crowded, but you just never know what you'll see:Boy's in bikinisGirls in surfboardsEverybody's rockin'Everybody's frugginGuys working out, people roller skating, maybe even some chainsaw juggling. You just never know. If you're up for a big ride, you can go all the way through Manhattan Beach to Redondo. Plenty of places for drinks and eats just off The Strand in the South Bay.",FABourdain

40,User friendly bike path,Travelled from Santa Monica pier to Marina del Rey covering about 10 miles round trip on a highly enjoyable bike ride in the Californian sunshine. Path is heavily used so be aware that some areas are slower but it just adds to the fun. Frequent stops are a must as there is always something to see. Venice beach area isn't as seedy as some suggest ( reminded me of any seaside area in the UK ). Please be aware that some areas approaching the marina have sections that require using the roads. Whilst safe to travel use caution if teenagers have chosen brake free bikes.,Adrian M
40,Diverse,Heading north from Santa Monica once you pass freak ville of Venice this is a great ride. The cycle path takes you away from the beach around Del Ray but is interesting. Stop of for coffee and crepes at the light house. The beaches of Manhattan and Hermosa are interesting past the fire pits at Dockweiler. It's all flat but the wind makes it a bit of an exertion.,tcp1002017
50,So much fun!!,"This is by far my favorite thing to do in the LA area. Flat, clean, well maintained Strand is the BEST way to see the coast. From north Santa Monica Beach all the way to Redondo Beach you'll see beautiful beach side homes, lovely ocean views as well as great seaside beac towns. Stop for lunch in Hermosa, have a drink in Redondo. Great way to spend a day!!",theresaw
50,Cool views,You can rent bikes from almost any corner and spend hours riding and stopping along the way for treats or a dip in the waves. The views are incredible and the price is right. (About $12/ hour) I think this is a California must do,amy c

50,Worth a ride,"Honestly we only took the path from Santa Monica to Venice beach, but we enjoyed it very much. It was pretty crowded and you have to navigate some walkers, skateboarders, etc but the winding path has awesome views and feels very Cali. Be sure to stop at the skatepark in Venice, fun to watch.",ItsDee9
40,Lots of fun,"this path is so cool, running along Santa Monica and Venice beaches. You can run, walk, cycle or even rollerblade and you can hire bikes and blaeds just south at the base of Santa Monica Pier",Troy010

40,Great beach path to cycle,"3 of us hired bikes at the Santa Monica pier and biked almost to Manhattan beach. We stopped off and shopped, watched some awesome skateboarders at the board park, crushed along on our bikes and ended with a stop off at one the many cafe and bars for food and drinks. This is the best and easiest place to ride along the beach we have found in California. Heaps of people but as there is a dedicated bike pathway it was easy. We",Henwoods24
50,A must do in Santa Monica!,Great afternoon riding bikes on this picturesque trail system. Won't miss the opportunity on our next trip! Lots of people watching and interesting artisans. First Friday is super busy but lots to see!,Mom_2_the_4th_Power
50,Great path,"Lots of room for cycles, all flat, we did 20 miles of it from pier to south and north, places to stop and eat, but make sure you leave cycles locked and in view, some have been stolen south of the pier, cycle hire does give you locks but not that strong",Steve T
50,26 mile bike path,This is a must do when in Santa Monica. It is a great scenic ride through Santa Monica and Venice. Worth checking out......,IAMTHETRAVELGOD

40,Beautiful views!,"Biked with the family from Venice Beach to Santa Monica and back. Wonderful bike path. Heads up though. The sand on the path in some places can make the path very slippery, and the segway traffic is annoying on what is suppose to be a bicycle path.",Sally M
40,Great cycle track in Santa Monica,"Hired bikes at Santa Monica pier (sorry forgot name). Excellent service, recommendations and rates. Cycled to Venice beach and then on to the fantastic stores in Abbot Kinney Road. Great shopping for my daughters and we had coffee at intelligentsia. All good and was easy and safe to cycle to.",bart_thompson
50,Great way to experience the la area beaches....,This is a great family or even adult activity if your in the area visiting or even if you live here. It's a perfect way to take in all the local beaches and get a glimpse of each ones individuality. We rented bikes right by the Santa Monica Pier and took off south! What a ride and so much fun. We stopped off at a few spots. Let the kids play on the playground and checked out a couple shops. It's a great way to get exercise and take it the awesome California coast in the LA Area.,Ctinac777
50,Best trip ever!!,Hire a bike from Santa Monica pier and just drive on a relaxed pace.. Enough to see!Stop at Muscle beach and have a stroll on a market on the way.Stop for a beer and drive back when your hour is over..Amazing relaxing trip for everybody who loves people watching and being outdoors!!,Bram
50,Awesome bike ride,"I really suggest to everyone visiting LA to rent a bike for 20$/day and bike on this bike path. You can see beautiful places and all the beaches near LA. I biked the entire path in 3 days. The first day I rented a bike by Santa Monica Pier and biked till Dogweiler beach (which is just after Marina del Rey), the weekend after I rented one in Marina del Rey and biked till Manhattan, the week after again I rented one in Manhattan beach and biked till Torrance beach at the very end of the path. If you have to choose one part of the path, I'd go for the most famous part that runs from Santa Monica Pier to Venice!Don't miss this when going to LA!",Francyfre
50,No better place to ride in LA,"Especially in the less crowded mornings, the bike path is great for biking and skating. You can always see the ocean and sailboats, and it's great for people watching. You can rent bikes at several stands, and the guys at Perry's are always helpful when my son has a bike issue. Today they showed us how to tighten the bolt and the lever the you clamp to keep the seat at the right height. You can rent bikes and helmets for all ages at several locations. I recommend parking midway between the pier and Venice so it's convenient to do either or both.",CindyZach
50,A must-do while in Santa Monica!,"My husband and I love riding our bikes back home in Baltimore and we try to make a point of riding bikes in new cities we visit too! It's the best way to see everything and this path is one not to be missed! We rented bikes from Sea Mist rentals right near the start of the pier, can't recommend them more highly! We didn't have time to do the entire trail unfortunately, but we did make to the end of Venice Beach and then back up again all the way past Will Rogers State beach. The path was beautiful right along the beach and the views were awesome. The path was understandably less crowded outside of Venice. We made a bunch of stops along the way to take in the sights and relax on the beach and there were plenty of accessible bike racks along the way! This trail is a must-see while in town!",Marlena W
50,Wonderful atmosphere!,"I have mostly been biking this path to/from the Santa Monica Pier to Venice. But just that part of the trail is so fantastic. Enjoy a relaxing ride on bike, rollerblades, segways, or whatever you prefer.",Victor F
50,Cruise along the beaches,A very good bike ride along the beaches and see some awesome things..Very recommended if you have a few hours to knock away.Bikes plenty to rent on the beach no problem..,bjvink
50,Great way to spend some time,"I've been to Santa Monica three times and all three, I've rented bikes or roller blades (from Sea Mist rentals) and cruised between Santa Monica and Venice. I've never gone more than a few miles, but it's a lot of fun. Smooth trail. Great people watching. And there's nothing like getting a little exercise while a cool ocean breeze wafts through your hair. Two thumbs up!",Garnet_Gyrl
50,Cudos to the town,"We walked 4 miles from where we were staying to Venice Beach. It was a Saturday and somewhat gloomy until much later in the day, but the bike path/walking path was well used even so. What a wonderful job has been done in the creation & maintenance of the path. There is the ocean, volleyball, muscle beach, restaurants and more along the way. Given the day, it was not overcrowded, but still well used. One can rent bikes at several places along the route. There are plenty of public restrooms if needed. The beaches appeared to be clean & well maintained. There are miles of them on which to walk or plop down for some sun. The beaches are manned with lifeguards. Family friendly with so many options for enjoyment.",michele s
50,Best bike path I've ever been on,We only did about a 3rd of the path but it was awesome! Everyone on the trail was so polite with great riding etiquette. You don't have to worry about cars and the scenery is beautiful. Who wouldn't want to ride with the ocean at your side!,Dawn
50,a must do,"our first day we went south form about the Santa Monica pier down past Venice Beach. talk about people watching! we watched street performers an skateboarders, and checked out the Venice beach shops,which seemed to be mostly T shirt shops, head shops and tattoo parlors. The next few times we went north of the Pier. The weather was good and it was scenic and relaxing",Howard S
40,Flat and fun,A nice bike ride.We were able to rent bikes for 10$/h.Had fun riding along the beach while enjoying the view.,Nicolas B
40,Extensive bike path through diverse neighbourhoods,"This is a great activity for cyclists of all abilities to explore the beach neighborhoods of Los Angeles. An easy flat ride , you can just tour the popular strip between Santa Monica and Venice, or extend your ride along the less crowded stretches. The path is safe and easy to follow along the beach front sections, but is a little bit tricky to follow as it detours around Marina Del Rey, and you do need to ride (in a cycle lane) along a few busy stretches of road. Bike hire is really easy from many locations along the path. A great way to spend a day, or a few shorter rides during your stay.",Lindsay M
50,Great path along scenic soythbay beaches,"Great biking, excellent site seeing. Can get a little busy with foot traffic on the weekends but as expected, nearly broke a leg dodging an unspuversied 2 year old that walked into the bike path. Try to go early in the morning if on weekend.",StonedTraveler
50,"Walk it, bike it, rollerskate it and feel the breeze of the Pacific ocean","Go early, just after sunrise if you can and watch the dolphins having fun in the pacific. You can start the Bike path in Santa Monica, Venice, Marina del Rey or anywhere in between Santa Monica (Pacific Pallisades) to Manhattan Beach. Later on the day it gets crowded with roller skaters and some tourists who're on a bike for the first time. You want to look around and take in the varied scenery, not having to watch out for pedestrians or careless bikers and skateboarders. It's the perfect way to discover the LA coast!",Li_Isings
50,Its all here!,"Long walks? Training runs? Beach volleyball? Its all here. Watching the waves, the people, the artists, the dog walkers, the rollerbladers, the lovebirds...great escape when you need one.",tigerlilyone

50,Great place to people watch and get some excerize at the same time.,"Walk it, rent a bike and ride it, run it, jog it, just do it. It is a great way to get some excellent exercise, see an amazing array of people, some beautiful ocean and great air.",Mark D
50,Fun way to cruise from Santa Monica to Venice,"We walk part of the way and rented bikes the other half. Is a very fun way to pass an afternoon. Get the chains for the bikes in case you want to get off and explore the different things you'll find through the path. Be careful while running, since there are people that don't respect the bicycle paths and just walk through the middle. Bikes cost around 20 dollars and hour, but the'll charge you according to use.",Tania
40,Good day activity,"The is a good route for biking with the ocean views all along the way. But it is not as fun on there weekends, since there are so many people around the pier. The rest of the route its pretty good.",vpd
50,The Best Bike Path in California,"There is nothing better than the Bike Path. It starts in Santa Monica, but you can grab it anywhere. It goes through Venice and continues all the way to Manhattan Beach. It can be crowded on the weekends so I avoid that and go on the weekdays. If you are not from LA, just rent a bike and have fun. It is safe and the views are beautiful. And no, you will not be using it late at night.",elizabethlascheid
50,Must DO!,"The 26 mile Bike Path is amazing. Round trip your looking at 52 miles of sun and sand and ocean most of the way; except an excursion thought the Marina.If you can, try to avoid doing this ride on holiday weekends and May through September, because it's very crowded!",kookat456
50,Nice way to see Santa Monica and Venice beaches,"We borrowed bikes at our hotel and went from the Santa Monica pier all the way to Marina del Rey and back, stopping on the way to check out the skate park and the promenade on Venice. Great experience!",Peter Munster
50,26 mile bike path Marina Del Rey - Venice - Santa Monica /Pacific Palisades - Malibu,"No matter where you start it is awesome, but watch out for pedestrians in Venice, so slow down many of the tourists do not read the no pedestrian signs and just walk into the path in front of you.You can rent bikes in Venice and Santa Monica and there are places to stop for food and drinks, as well as water fountains and public restrooms.Places to stop along the way, or at beginning or end of day, bring a lock!!!and follow rules regarding walking the bike at Washington St. People do get tickets!:Marina Del Rey, there is a small restaurant a few steps from the path and a Starbucks further down on Washington St for coffee, fruit or oatmeal, eggs or whatever.Venice, there are a few sidewalk cafes but more than a few homeless mostly harmless, be sure to stay on the bike path, if not you must walk the bike if heavy pedestrian foot traffic which is a separate path. There are sidewalk art and crafts vendors, best to go earlier am or later pm to get great deals.Shutters hotel has an upscale oceanfront restaurant open to everyone, and if staying there you can rent on of their teal beach cruisers.Santa Monica side walk food stands near the pier, outdoor cafes serve beer, wine, ice cream, steaks, salads, across from the Santa Monica Aquarium which is small scale compared to the Long Beach one but really great for smaller children to have a general understanding of sea life.There are Perry's Beach Cafes all along the bike path area, be sure to bring a lock.The bathrooms aren't great so wait until you hit tone ones actually on the Pier, or after the Pier isn't too bad, best is at at the Annenberg Community Complex. Seriously! Take Lysol hand wipes and or seat covers.The Pier has amusement rides, vendors, a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, pizza and sit down fish restaurants including Forest Gumps and a very nice upscale Fish restaurant.On Ocean Ave near the Pier is an excellent mexican food restaurant with highly rated margaritas. Also can watch trapeze artists, play pinball in arcade, ride the merry go round, more ice cream with sundaes, floats, whatever!Best area to take a bathroom break, is safe... police station is there before going on to Malibu.See the Jonathan Beach Club, can't really stop there, it's a belong to very pricey club.As well as the Santa Monica Bay Club which is for residents who live at the top of the hill.Best stop is Annenberg Community Complex, great indoor / outdoor, an on the sand restaurant, and walk up counter that has not too pricey great lattes if you just want coffee, tea, or water and a snack.There is a pool with activities, a great play ground for kids with swing sets, monkey bars, found water fountain to cool off, take a tour of Marian Davies beach front home or sit in the shade to cool off. Public restrooms and if you reserve early enough through Perry's Beach Cafe you can order a Concierge umbrella and lunch setup for more than a few dollars.Further up in Malibu / Palisades section of the path ..... haven't gone much further than Annenberg. It's really a fun ride, nice breezes, Venice is a bit gnarly!I used to live there and rode the path frequently.Have fun!",Leah B
40,The best thing about Venice Beach,This is the best thing about Venice Beach. The very fact you can avoid and cycle away from all of the nutters and druggies is a massive bonus. It's seems this is a place where you can't just have a nice stroll without someone begging for money or weed.,M15KY
30,Santa Monica Pier to Venice Pier,"We hired 2 bikes today for 2hrs. We enjoyed ourselves and the bike path facilities. We didn't complete the full 26 miles!! It's great that they had a separate walking/running path to the bike riders. You can't complain about the view but there isn't a lot along the way. We thought there would be more stalls, shops, coffee shops etc. I think the biggest deterrent was the large population of homeless as you ride past. It makes you feel unsafe and also takes away from the experience. There are plenty of toilet facilities and water fountains as you ride. There isn't any coverage from the sun so make sure you wear plenty of sunscreen, a hat and appropriate clothing. We hired our bikes from Sea mist and we're happy with their prices.",Stefandjules
40,Great busy bike path,"Hired a couple of bikes with my lovely lady and road the length of this path. It goes right along the sand and goes through all the major coastal spots. Very busy path so keep your wits about you, however great scenery all the way along.",Hugh J
50,Needed the exercise,After good eating on a cruise we needed to hire a couple of bikes from the pier and get some leg action going. Went North first as quieter and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.After our return we headed South towards Venice Beach (that's an eye opener-homeless people although no-one bothers you and spaced out people). We continued on hoping to get to Del Ray Marina but the path runs out and you have to negotiate the road way with other traffic - a bit scary. We gave up and headed back to the Pier. It cost us $18US for 2 bikes for about 3 hrs. A lot of fun and highly recommend.,blondy36
30,"Long, scenic ride","From Malibu to Redondo Beach, you can bicycle along the Pacific Ocean and enjoy the sites and sounds of the many beach communities and the beaches.",buffalojim67

50,Superb,Best activity to do when you stay in Santa Monica.Rent a bike and spend your time on the and around the beach.There is always a lot to see and to do.Just cruising along the beach is always fun!I recommend to do this,Carlvanloey
50,Excellent Facility,We walked several miles around Santa Monica Pier. Access to the path is free but you will probably have to pay to park if you arrive by car. The hard-surface path is wonderfully maintained and there are designated areas for bicycles and pedestrians (though not everyone was paying attention to this). Bicycle rentals and public restrooms are available. The beach view is beautiful and the path is excellent for people-watching. We used a wheelchair on the path and access was great.,CrankingChick
40,Gliding along in paradise,"If you like people watching, the ocean, sun and sand, then this is the place for you. We enjoy riding bikes to Venice and then north of the SM Pier. Along the way you'll see surfers, roller hockey players, tourists on Segways, body builders and sun worshippers. Fun for all.",terere2
40,You cannot visit without experiencing the Bike path,"You should not come to Santa Monica and not go for a ride on the Bike Path, it is just one of those thing you will probably remember for ever. With all the characters you meet on the path, everything from the swimsuit model on rollerblades, local bike clubs exercising , and a skateboarder wearing nothing but an adult diaper (true story every account). You can rent a bike in several locations, and grab breakfast or lunch on the way. If you stay at the Fairmont Miramar they can lend you bikes for free.",Magnus K
50,Bike path with an unbeatable view,"Although it is officially a bike path, be prepared to share it with pedestrians and skaters, especially in the more congested areas around Santa Monica and Venice Beach. On a busy weekend don't be surprised if you find it easier to walk your bike through the Venice area. However, these congested areas offer great people watching (muscle beach, the Venice Boardwalk, kite flyers, street performers) as well as many places to stop for refreshments, including places on the Santa Monica Pier. Be sure to lock your bike. Also, be aware that in some places, especially in Venice, the sand on the bike path can be dangerously slippery and falls are common (I have bruises to prove it) even at slow speeds. North of Santa Monica, the crowds are lighter and you have sweeping views of the ocean, the Marion Davis beach house (Annenberg Beach House), vollyball players, and the Pacific Palisades. Take in the view, people watch, enjoy a snack, and get some exercise on a fairly level and well maintained bike path. If you rent a bike from one of the vendors along the beach, allow at least two hours (minimum) because you will probably want to ride farther than you think and it will take longer than you estimate, especially on a Sat or Sun.",OnlyJoe
50,Great relaxing cycle along the path.,"If you require a relaxing morning or afternoon hiring a bike and taking the path is great, just wish it was a little longer.",RedPartridge

It was a bit warm that day and we could have used something to drink. There are not any places to buy drinks once you leave Venice beach--at least not until El Segundo. Beautiful bike ride. Very safe. Easy. Highly recommend for all!",olgabs
40,Ocean view bike trail,"It is really wonderful to have such a moderate bike trail nearby. There is one stretch (1 mile, perhaps?) that takes you on some busy Venice Beach streets but it is mostly uncrowded and beautiful. I rode from Santa Monica to Manhatten Beach, found a lovely restaurant, enjoyed lunch and rode back.",MarilynLA
50,Great walk any time of day (or cycle of course),We walked down here each morning (before it got too hot) and enjoyed a coffee overlooking the beach where there were all sorts of activities. We were even lucky enough to see Dolphins breaking the surf on our last morning.A beautiful area of the world and one I very much want to take my children back to.,howlifeismeanttobe

We started in Santa Monica and rode to Venice (stopping at playgrounds etc along the way), then we parked our bikes at Venice for a couple of hours and ate & explored all around Venice. Later in the day we rode back past Santa Monica and kept riding up the coast towards Malibu. Tired legs eventually asked us to stop & turn around but it would have been lovely to just keep on riding! It's very easy/flat riding & so much to see along the way.We finished the day with a couple of rides at Santa Monica pier. Perfect family fun day.",Travelbug070

50,Every chance I get,"Took a short 6 mile ride yesterday and will go farther and north tomorrow, weather permitting.Ride through Marina del Rey is going to get a whole lot nicer when the soon to be completed bike path off Washington Blvd is finished and opened.Was happy when we stopped at the MDR Info lighthouse and could borrow a screwdriver from the staff for a minor repair. Thank you, it was much appreciated! Great tourism info there, too.Fisherman's Village had such potential and some nice restaurants and Hornblower cruises: I wish more people would go and enjoy the lovely, peaceful setting.You can ride all the way south to Torrance (but it seems I never get south of Dockweiler Beach when I stop to watch planes)!Riding north from Venice Pier you do have to be careful of the random pedestrian tourists walking in the bike path/lane without regard to all the bikes whizzing by them. That's frustrating. Lots of places to fill up with water or use the bathroom. Stop for lunch in SMO. Ride all the way to Will Rogers SP. looking forward to my next ride!",Saranger
40,Loved riding with my kids!,"We had a lovely time riding along the bike path at Santa Monica - wasn't crowded on a Sunday afternoon, most people obeyed the pedestrian/biking lanes (not all....) and the view is just amazing. Everything is in great condition, bathrooms at regular intervals, and just can't beat being close to the water. We loved it, and want to go back!",Maria B
20,Be Careful on the Bike path,We live in Santa Monica and used to go to the bike path along the beach on a weekly basis. It is crowded now and the skaters and bicyclists are not very observant or careful. On one occasion a cyclist hit my wife's bike and she fell and was not really hurt. On another occasion a cyclist hit my wife bike and she fell and was severely injured. She had a broken collar bone and numerous abrasions and road burns which took a long time to heal. Cyclists in Los Angeles and Santa Monica and Long Beach do not obey the rules of the road so you must watch for them.,Philly1314
40,Great! Good views! Take a ride!,"Mostly well-maintained (hey, Venice Beach, can you blow some sand off?), and you'll ride through all the beach towns.To be avoided at all cost on summer weekends, unless you're out good and early, like before 9 a.m.but the price is right, right?",KALKAT
50,Great way to explore,"We hired bikes from a local bike shop in 4th Street. They were $15 per day per bike. After only a few hundred meters one of the bikes had a flat tyre. A quick phone call to our hire shop they asked us to go to the Perry's bike shop and get the tyre fixed and they pay us back which they did. From then it was smooth sailing and we had a lovely afternoon. We cruised down the beach to Marina Del Rey, went through the canals of Venice and than back to Santa Monica. It was a great way of exploring the area, being active and independent. We loved it",globalbabe50
40,Take your time and enjoy!,We loved hiring bikes from just near the pier and spending the afternoon riding down to Venice Beach and also Marina Del Ray. It's beautiful along the coast and the bike paths are really well set up. Be prepared to see a lot of homeless people who have set up camp along the beach.,Josh_soph
50,Not only for bikes,"This wonderful bike path is at the beach. It is not only for bikes ,anybody can walk , run or roller skate . It is a great people watching while enjoying the beautiful , wide and clean beach and the mesmerizing waters of the ocean, admiring at the same time the mountains that surrounds it . If hungry there are plenty of eateries on the beach.But the best part is watching the most incredible sunsets, they have been determined to be among the 10 most beautiful in the world. At that moment it seems that the time stands still , everybody stops (except for taking pictures) and absorbs the magnificent red and pinks and yellows within a background of the most clear and blue skies.If in the area, make sure you enjoy the bike path with everything it has to offer.",Delga

50,A fun day,We hired the shared social bikes (Hulu) because they appeared to be newer and in better condition than a lot of the beach hire bikes.My 10 year old daughter and I had a great day - we started at the Pier and rode down to Marina Del Ray. We stopped at Venice and watched some street entertainers before heading to Shutter's for lunch.It was a great way to explore the beach area.,kaiah04

50,Rent bikes and spend all day exploring beach towns!,"My husband and I do this every time we come to Santa Monica, and we come a couple times a year. You can rent bikes anywhere in Santa Monica, but the most convenient is on the beach by the pier. Make sure you get a lock for the bike. Head towards Venice, stop and have a drink and explore this crazy beach town, then head on down to Marina del Ray, then you'll hit Manhattan Beach, and Hermosa Beach, where you can stop and have lunch. Great beach town. Lots of activities. The ride is flat, right on the beach, and absolutely stunning on a sunny day! Love! Love!, Love!",Randy W
50,Beautiful Path Next to Ocean,"So glad my husband and I decided to rent bikes to fully appreciate Santa Monica and Venice Beach. A long, easy way to get your exercise while taking in the sights. In one direction you see the fun and craziness of Venice Beach while the other direction takes you to a quiet, residential area, all with a gorgeous view of the ocean.",BethNBK
40,This was such a fun activity!,"Our family of 4 rented bikes one afternoon and rode from Santa Monica to Muscle Beach. We had a great time, stopping and looking at the skaters in the park and just people watching while we rode. The path was well-maintained and since we went early in the day, it was relaxing and we could check out all the beauty and interesting sites along the way. We had lunch in Venice Beach and rode back after lunch when the path was pretty crowded with people walking slowly and we had to stop a lot. Nothing you can do about this, but it was the only negative. Our advice would be to go early.",Wethreetravellots
50,Best way to get around,"We rode from Casa del Mar north to see the Eames House in Pacific Palisades, and south to Venice. Great people watching and ocean breezes",austininternational
40,Bike It!,We were going to walk from the Pier to Venice Beach and decided to rent bikes instead. Got them from Shutters Hotel right near the path. Glad we did! It was really fun. Best way to cover lots of area and not get too tired.,theheatonfamily
50,Awesome place for exercising!,"This path is awesome for all types of exercising. You can run, jog, bike, roller blade, skate board or just stroll. The views are specular and it makes for some great people watching too!!",Cynthia A
50,We loved riding our bikes with the kids!,No need for gears! This path is flat! It was a great way to spend the day exploring. We rented bikes under the Santa Monica Pier for $20/day (they give you bike locks)! So fun,6ettin-out-there-
50,the Bike Path,"If you love riding your bike at the beach, this is a great path. Most of it is for bikes only, although some of the path is shared with pedestrians. You start up at Pacific Palisades and ride south..pass thru Santa Monica, Venice, Marina del Rey, Manhattan Beach, Redondo, etc...... Just be aware that on Sundays..it's really crowded !!",airbrush1212
30,Be careful,"My daughter had a tough fall on this path due to a cyclist crossing into her lane on a tight curve. Sand gets on the paths in the Venice Beach area, causing slippery biking. She likely sprained or broke her wrist-so enjoy, but do be careful",happytarheel
40,Great views!,"A nice, relaxing ride with great views along the way. Gets crowded as the day goes on. Better to ride earlier in the day. Venice area a little dicey-but I didn't get off my bike there. Locked it up in Santa Monica and walked up to Main St. to enjoy shops and lunch.",Deborah R
40,A Southern California Adventure,"It has been a while since we have done the bike path. It is great fun but it is a long ride. It's not the 26 mile part, it's the 26 mile part x two since you have to ride back. The last time we rode back we had the wind in our face so we were pretty exhausted. The best time to do it would be during the week when it is not so crowded. There are places to stop along the way and you can ride all the way down to Palos Verdes. It's a great ride - the only part that is a bit tricky is when you get to Marina Del Rey, you have to ride in the street for a while and it can be pretty busy. That part isn't a long distance - maybe 1 1/2 miles. You also get to ride through the boat yards and through part of Marina Del Rey which is nice. The other nice direction to go is north towards Santa Monica. You ride under the pier, keep going, and you will reach a restaurant called ""Back on the Beach Cafe"" (in Santa Monica) where you can sit at a table on the sand. Haven't been here since they changed the menu but it has always been a nice place to sit, eat, watch the waves and stare out at the beautiful Pacific Ocean in front of you.",HappyTravelersJD
50,Bike electric style,"We rented a regular city bike and an electric bike from the Santa Monica bike rental store across from the Pier. It was a bit chaotic picking them up, but the bikes worked well!What a glorious fun time to ride down the double wide concrete paths along the beach!The electric bike was especially fun for the ""momma"" in the group!",T&MWallis

50,Perfect Way to Explore!,"We did not have a car during our stay and did not want to take a very long trip by public transportation to only go 3 miles away. So...we rented two bikes right near the Santa Monica Pier for a decent price (I think we looked up a coupon online for it). We biked from Santa Monica to Venice Beach on a beautiful afternoon/evening. The path is somewhat busy with bikers, but pretty wide and suitable for the amount of traffic (at least in this stretch of the path). This is only a couple miles, so not far at all! We did not have time to go any further; however this is a perfect distance for people who just want leisurely fun and to explore Venice Beach. The views of the beach and getting to visit the scenes of Venice Beach were definitely worth the cost of renting the bikes!",Halle R
50,Amazing!,"If in Santa Monica or Venice, you have to ride/walk/skate down this path. The weather is amazing. the views are great. The trip is worth the time and you get a great workout.",bmalin77
50,Great cycle path,"A well signed and patched cycle way that keeps you away from the traffic. It's all easy and flat going and is well signposted. In parts it's busy with walkers, runners, roller bladers and skateboarders but it's all part of the fun. We went from redonda beach to Santa Monica with ease. There were plenty of bike rental sites along the route, we used one in Redondo.",Mikesalter
50,Really wonderfully designed bike path along beach.,"great bike path, wanted to ride to Manhattan Beach but was on the street in Venice for about a mile each way to continue to dedicated bike path..",goldengirl618
50,Great ride,"This bike path is perfectly flat and well maintained making it an easy ride for all. The path goes along the beach and is used by thousands daily. The best way to describe this path is is "" a very pleasant ride""",Jgoldchain
50,Very nice path,"This is a must if you go to Santa Monica. You can just rent a bike at any of the companies that offer it, and bike from there to Venice Beach. There is nice places where you can stop, sit down, take a drink, people watch, etc.",josepmaria83
50,Wonderful exercise!,"Don't forget if you are visiting S.M. to put on your shorts and tee shirt and take a long walk along this iconic pathway from S.M. to the one and only famous Venice Beach and beyond. You can eat, buy ice cream + +. Don't forget to bring your bottle of water and your sun screen. Plenty of people watching. If you want to bring your towel you can sit on the sand and watch the Pacific. Lovely!",TheFlyingFrock
50,Nothing beats the weather in sunny SoCal,"Rent some bikes at Santa Monica cycle and enjoy the great scenic ride under the sun down to Venice beach. We rode with our two kids and it was fantastic to start from the pier and bask in the sun. You can stop to eat ice cream, play at the jungle gyms, have a hot dog, watch the skaters, and play in the sand. This is truly California living. Two hours is a perfect ride but you can ride for longer if you like.",Alex N
40,Great cycling attraction,"Great cycling lanes, wide and fun, with beautiful beach scenery.lots of rental shops if you don't have you own.Expect to see lots of weirdos too",Shay M
50,Best fun in Los Angeles,"This is one of the best fun activity in Los Angeles. If you have your own bike it's better. However if you don't, there are many places you can rent around Santa Monica pier. This is what I do all the time. I rent from Santa Monica pier, then I ride to Pacific Palisades. Then I turn back to Santa Monica, follow the bike path to Venice Beach. At Venice Beach, you need to ride a short distance on Washington Boulevard with traffic. Then bike path resumes in Marina Del Rey along Admiralty way. Follow the signs that shows bike route and you'll end up in Playa Del Rey. Keep following bike path, pass Dockweiler beach, you will arrive Manhattan Beach; bikepath continuous through Hermosa Beach and I suggest you stop at Redondo beach and come back to Santa Monica. You will have so much fun, scenery is amazing. Good for kids and elderly, everyone in the family.",Mert51
40,Cruising Venice on a Bike,"This is the best way to cruise the area. Once you get to the area and find parking this will be the best bet to access one area to the other. There are bike paths and pedestrian paths. This keeps the fast movers separate from the slower ones. I can't imagine doing this in super hot weather, we did it in February which was perfect weather. Although if you don't bike often it can hurt the cooch. 🙄",Toni W
50,Great way to get around PCH on foot or 2 wheels!,"This was a scenic, easy path for bikes, roller blades, joggers and walkers. Just relaxing with great views. We walked 1.5 miles of this from the Annenberg Community Beach House/ Marion Davies Guest House to the Santa Monica Pier and back. Great way to see both sites without having to drive between.",Katherine S
50,A great way to explore beach towns,"The bike path runs along the beach from Santa Monica to Redondo Beach. Most of the bike path is on protected dedicated bike paths. You are riding on public streets only when you are going from Venice Beach to Marina Del Rey. There are so many interesting places to explore along this route. In Santa Monica, check out the 3rd Street Promenade with lots of history in the area, lots of restaurants and shops. Santa Monica Place is also worth a visit. This large mall has been remodeled and is full of great shops and restaurants. In Venice, there is, of course, the Venice Beach. Funky tourist shops. Great place to people watch. Muscle Beach is found there. Don't miss the Venice Canals. This is a residential area which was built, I believe in the 20's, to replicate Venice Italy. Quiet, beautiful, and close in proximity to Venice Beach. Next, you are in Marina Del Rey, a large boating harbor. Completely different scenery. Transitioning from Venice to Marina Del Rey, you will need to travel on Washington Blvd a short distance. A good stop is Burton Chase Park. This is a beautifully situated park in the Marina. Nice place to stroll. Another good stop is Fisherman's Village. On weekends in the early afternoon there is usually live free entertainment. Good place to stop and dance. Going from Marina Del Rey to Playa Del Rey, there is a stretch of the bike path where you have the Marina on one side and Ballona Creek on the other. It is my favorite part of the bike path. You then bike through Playa Del Rey, Hermosa Beach and Redondo Beach. Redondo Beach has a pier with lots of boats, restaurants and shops.",Annette M
50,Must Use!,"There is an amazing bike path on the beach that will rent you bikes, it's easy to ride to venice beach! Great for getting some sun and being active in a cute area!",Nicolas S

30,Pedestrians beware,Unfortunate experience for pedestrians just trying to get to the beach. There wasn't adequate room for walking. But it's great if you're on a bicycle,Travelin-Renoite
50,So much fun!,"I've been to California a number of times for work. But this trip was for fun. And I had so much fun riding bikes along the beach on the bike path. I parked in the large lot by the pier in Santa Monica which was really convenient for a central spot, easy parking, and plenty of bike rentals nearby. I rented a bike from a group just south of the pier. They were the least expensive because they charged by the hour instead of per bike. Make sure you think about how many hours you'll be riding so you spend the right amount of money for the time. Get a bike lock from the rental company so you can stop along the path. Lots of cool places to see along the path! The path ends on Venice which is a must see part of your trip on the path!",Kingjaners
40,go early in the day,We have done this a few times - can get a little scary when little children are on their bicycles if crowded,Barb B
50,Perfect day,"We hired bikes at Santa Monica bike centre. Got $10 off for renting before 10am. It took about 2 hours to get to Rodondo pier where we turned around. This was at a very leisurely pace and we stopped at a cafe on route too. We got a bit confused by the trail at Venice beach. The rest was easy. Check out the map at the cycle hire place before you leave. I never cycle normally and the last hour on the return leg I was fairly tired. Great day out, lovely views of the waves crashing on the beach, surfers, beach front houses. If I went back to Santa Monica I would do the same day out.",bridgejet

50,Best Day - so much to see and do along the way,"We rented our bikes from Sea Mist Skate & Bike Rentals under the pier at Santa Monica. It was cheap and cheerful, bikes looked well used but were in great working order and easy to ride. Staff were efficient. We got a ladies cruiser, a mens mountain bike with tag along and a BMX. They had a great variety of bikes. Children had to wear helmets which was great.Lots of people along the way but traffic moved well with pedestrian crossings and things well signed to make it enjoyable and accessible for everyone.We were warned to keep a close eye on our bikes we hired a lock ($20 refundable deposit when returned) we followed this advice and had no trouble.We travelled from Santa Monica to Venice Beach and back with ease. We had 7 & 9 year old children with us and there was not one complaint. We then travelled past the pier and rode towards Malibu. We rode from 11am - the shop shut at 5pm and could've kept going. A fantastic day out for the whole family. Enjoy.",Cara M

This walkable, laid back town has great shopping, art galleries, restaurants, and outdoor activities including the bike path. We rented bikes from the new Hulu services - which was convenient but not for leaving the city limits - and rode down to Venice Beach, where there is a lively boardwalk, lovely canal walk, and upscale shopping. The views and sunsets along this wide beach are spectacular! We stayed at an Airbnb apartment and there are many available that are convenient to the downtown. I already want to go back, slow down, have a glass of wine and watch the sun go down over Santa Monica Blvd.",Liz G

50,Must-do when in Santa Monica,Pleasant experience to get the feel of Santa Monica and Venice Beach. Recommend visit Venice Canals afterarriving on the end of the Bike Path in Venice.,juliopizzi
50,Great bike path,"This is one of the best things to do when visiting LA or if you live here. Spend a day leisurely biking the path and stopping to eat or grab a coffee along the way. You go through many different beach towns and each one is worth a stop. Only tricky part is going through Marina Del Rey harbor because you have to go inland a little bit and cross some main roads. The go around the perimeter of the harbor but there are some great boats to see. You can rent bikes if visiting. The wind is usually behind you one direction and against you the other, sometimes it's quite strong. Bring water and a lock so you can walk about it take a dip in the ocean. The beach is very wide so you wouldn't want to wheel the bike to the water through the sand.",Claudia M

There are so many restaurants/cafes along the way and plenty of great buildings and people to watch along the way.

There are plenty of people on the bike path, stick to the right and everyone will go at their own pace.",EliseH9
50,Must Do!,"How fun is this! The views, the scenery! Think waves hitting the shores and water splashing near the path in places. Think of small shops along the way to stop and browse as well as outdoor cafes. If you are a more serious rider, don't expect a PR.

50,A Very Unique and Fun Experience,"We are 66-year-old retirees who gave up biking a few years ago, but decided to dust off our wheels to take advantage of this wonderful opportunity that is so unique to SoCal - and we had a fantastic experience! The path, called The Strand by locals, runs 26 miles from Will Rogers State Beach just north of Santa Monica south down to Torrance Beach. We started from the Santa Monica pier and pedaled a 20-mile loop almost to El Segundo and back. This was on the Monday of Christmas week. The path was fairly clear when we started at 11:30 a.m., but the Santa Monica/Venice section was overcrowded with bikers. skateboarders, roller skaters, joggers, walkers and bikers of every conceivable ilk when we returned around 4:00 pm. While the crowd provided an amazing opportunity to just ""people watch,"" navigating through it reduced the fun of the biking experience itself. If you choose to go further south than Venice, the path leaves the beach front and you will have to navigate your way along a busy city street (Washington) for several blocks and around Marina del Rey before you rejoin the beach front south of the marinas. This was a bit of a challenge for first-time riders, but the path is well marked and we benefited from an excellent map provided by our bike rental. South of Marina del Rey, the path rejoins the beach and you are given the opportunity to bike much more freely without the congested crowds, The flights leaving directly overhead from LAX are a noise nuisance, but also a source of entertainment as you ride along.. There are several options for quality bike rentals. We chose the Bike Shop on the corner of 2nd and Colorado in Santa Monica, because its rates were the most reasonable ($20 each for an entire day/ more than 3 hours), the shop appeared to be a little more professional and better maintained than others, and they took credit. A disadvantage is that it is located about three blocks uphill from the path, so we needed 10 minutes to walk our bikes down to the path (not comfortable immediately riding the bikes downhill in heavy city traffic), and then walking them back up the steep hill after our ride. Regardless, I would use them again. Other options are Perry's ($30/day, cash only) which has multiple locations along the path, and Breezebikeshare.com which has several locations, but requires setting up an on-line account before you can use the service. Whatever your choice of route and bike rental, it would be a shame for any visitor who is physically capable to leave Santa Monica without taking advantage of this wonderful path.",westsidecouple
50,It's a pretty amazing ride.,"The trail is one that is shared by bikes, skaters, runners, dogs, and who knows what else as you pass through Venice Beach. So, it isn't a place where you are going to set any speed records. However, if you find yourself zipping along the PCH on your carbon-framed speed machine, take the time to hop off the road and enjoy this short, interesting, relaxing and beautiful stretch of pavement that winds it's way down the center of a beach that is like no other. You won't be sorry you took the detour.",TeamRoadKill

40,If you want to explore the beach cities that's an option. But not for a speed work out,"This legendary bike trail in 2006 was named after of Marvin Braude, Los Angeles City Councilman. Formerly it was known simply as The Strand.Starting at Will Rogers State Beach near Palisades, it runs along the ocean, passing Santa Monica Pier and Venice Beach, then it goes away from the coast, skirting Marina del Rey and returns to the coast at the mouth of Ballona Creek and continuing further along all Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach, Redondo Beach. It ends at Torrance Beach at the foot of the Palos Verdes Hills.If you want to explore the beach cities, be imbued with an eclectic atmosphere of Venice, hear the sound of the ocean waves and breathe it’s brisk scent, rent a bicycle at one of the many rental agencies at Santa Monica beach. But keep in mind that during weekend the trail is very crowded by the same cyclists, runners, roller skaters, and just idly loitering public and gapers, so you have to be extremely careful and use caution. Local cyclists try to avoid this path during their workouts, and use it just as an access to PCH route or to the hills of Palos Verdes.",MT W

It gets a little crowded north of Marina del Rey, but still a lot of fun since there is so much to see.Aside from the random tourist walker crossing the path unknowing, this path is well maintained and avoids any traffic.Best time of year is post September - End of May.",VickiLosAngeles

You weave your way through miles of beach front and see some pretty interesting people and things along the way...Venice beach is as if the circus stopped for lunch and never left town. There is an opportunity for some quality people watching here...amazing skate park where kids and adults are ripping it up and doing things you see on TV on skateboards and BMX bikes...Venice beach sometimes gets a bad rap, but make your way through the communitt onto AbBot Kinney Street and see what best about Venice. This ride will take you through Marina e Del Ray and airport area. You will get away from the beach side of things, but there is a marked bike path pretty much entire way. Lots of great spots to stop and go for a swim in the ocean. Once you get to Manhattan have lunch near the pier and make your way home....awesome way to spend a day!!",kidcollins
50,Highlight of our trip,"My husband and I love to bike but we are not hard core , however we do it regularly.While staying in LA we rented bikes for two days and the highlight of our trip was biking along the strand. We started out in Santa Monica and followed the path all the way to Manhattan Beach, around 15 miles one way. Spectacular views of the ocean with many wonderful stops along the way. You can bike for as little or as long as you like it was a wonderful experience I highly recommend it.",Racquel W
50,Good exercise and fun,"My wife and I cycled this path fom Venice Beach, past Santa Monica Pier, and all the way up to the Northern entrance to the Pacific Palasides (Temesala Canyon Road). We did it on a Sunday morning at 08:30am, there were absolutely loads of people either running, cycling, or walking. We saw a famous celebrity run past us, and even saw a MTV pop video being filmed, with the film crews on motorized scooters.Well worth hiring a bicycle, ours had pedal-back brakes, which my wife found hard to use, she never had a BMX as a kid.",Ray_Finkle_9
50,"A wonderful area to ride, easy level path, minor diversion through Venice","You really have to do this whilst in that area of beach. Hire a bike. Enjoy the sights - both the people watching, the views, the changing beaches. A great, relaxing and easy way to cover a lot of ground.",GlennMans
50,Nice way to see Venice beach area.,We stayed in Santa Monica and biked down past Venice Beach and down the path about 6 miles and turned around. It was a hot day so we didn't go the whole 26 miles . Great way to see the other areas:),JDA9DJALK
50,The best way to spend a day off!!!,"Amazing views of the ocean. My favorite way to spend a sunny day off and also a fun, affordable activity to do with out-of-town visitors! If you’re visiting or just don’t have a bike, there are plenty of places along the Strand where you can rent one for the day. The sights, the breeze, and the exercise are so worth it!!!",Cassandra816
50,"Hire a bike, feel healthy and enjoy the breeze",This is a great way to see Santa Monica and Venice Beach. Hire a bike and feel like a local riding alongside the sand with the breeze in your hair.Make sure you stop at the skatepark and watch the guys performing tricks.,MikeManchesterUK
50,Seen it on TV ...now done it,"So many TV shows and Movies feature suntanned Californians cycling ,jogging or roller skating along this beachside cycle path. We rented bikes at Santa Monica Pier and did the Venice beach to Will Rogers beach section and back .... glad we did, it was fantastic. It's a must do",Mike R
50,Ha must do in Santa Monica,The bike path is a great way to see the Santa Monica frontPrices seem to range from $15-$25 depending on quality of bike and durationThere are no inclines it's flat all the way,TheAJFexperience
50,"Super biking experience, best on the West Coast",One of the joys of living in the People's Republic of Santa Monica is the Pacific ocean. And one of the best ways to savor the beachfront is to amble along the path on ones bicycle. It can get pretty hot and crowded during the summer so get up early. 6 am is best!,vincemc
50,Also known as the Strand,"I lived at the Oakwood Apts at the end of Washington, then the Marina City Club, both of which provided easy access to this 26 mile uninterrupted stretch of roller blade and bike friendly sidewalk that snakes thru all flavors and looks of Southern California. The locals wear it out... Although I got shot at one night next to Venice... Weird...",Steve O
50,Great trip for views of the ocean,"It was a great trail. Nice views of the ocean. Had to rent a bike, wish I had one of my own to make it a little more expedient and comfortable.",Brian V
40,Great bike path,We hired bikes and robe down to Venice beach. Loved the diversity and sights we saw. Easy ride as we had two kids with us who did it also. Ended the ride with a beer at the pub next to the hire place and watched the locals enjoy the first NFL game of the season.,tracy b
40,Fun Spot,"We lived in corporate housing for a few months next to the bike path and we enjoyed plenty of time on it! My husband and I LOVE to walk, so we spent hours on this path walking from Santa Monica to Venice or the other way (towards Malibu).My one pet peeve is the bikers who get in the pedestrian lane because there is a dedicated BIKE lane. This would be especially irritating when I was walking my very small dog, people didn't seem to care if they got their bikes close to him.Be careful of the Lance Armstrong types that think this path is the Tour de France, some people do ride way too fast on here and aren't conscientious enough to slow down in the spots that allow pedestrian crossings. I watched a few of these people wipe out when they had to stop suddenly. LOLSeriously though, be careful because sand does end up on the path and it can be quite slippery if you are biking or rollerblading. I used to rollerblade a LOT and I would be wary of skating on this with the loose sand.Enough kvetching, this is a BEAUTIFUL spot to take a leisurely stroll and not have to worry too much about getting hit by moving vehicles.",NYCaliKara
50,Must Do,"My husband and I rented bikes and rode on the bike path along the beach. It was beautiful and relaxing. Riding through different areas gave us a good sense of the different areas. The views were beautiful. Highly recommend.Of note - Not a difficult ride - I hadn't ridden a bike in years. I was tired after, but it is flat and easy to stop and walk if needed. Do not be scared away if you are nervous about not bike riding in some time.Also, when renting bikes they do provide a lock and key so if you wanted to leave bike to grab something to eat or shop, it is very doable.",Jennifer S
50,I beautiful safe family bike ride,"I did this on a hire bike, the best way to seek out the best places to eat and visit along the strip. Hire a bike from anywhere on the front and have a nice safe family bike ride. I put mine on my STRAVA for posterity and to show off",Lance B
50,So Much Fun,"We had such a great time doing the 26 mile bike path. I hadn't been on a bike in ages and I had forgotten how fun it is.This is a very scenic bike path, we stopped quite a few times to explore the area. Venice Beach was a very interesting place to visit and we spent quite a bit of time there.We hired our bikes through Sea Mist Bike Rentals and only cost us $20 each for the day... can highly recommend them.Definitely worth doing during your trip to Santa Monica!",Holden-Gal
50,No Trip to Socal is Complete without Time on this Trail!!!!!,"You can walk. You can run, bike, blade, skateboard or roll…However you like to move, this path is the place. So get there! Do a mile or 10 or all 26. It's truly a scenic scene not to be missed!!!! PS…if you need wheels, there's lots of rentals right on the strand!",SleepersGourmet
50,A must do!!,Really amazing bike path! We rode from Wiltshire blvd to Venice beach and back at a leisurely pace in just over an hour,Lorraine P
50,Perfect walk,We parked at Santa Monica Pier and walked part of the cycle path to Venice Beach. It's really well maintained and easy to walk along. Great views of the ocean and the beautiful beach. It's hard for someone from England to get their head around how big this is! It's a great place to walk very relaxed and chilled. Lots of great memories to last a lifetime,gilberri
40,Made a wrong turn but got back on track,"We did this on a Sunday morning, with bikes we borrowed from our hotel. It was a really nice way to see the area. I will say that at one point, the path somewhat split off at a parking lot and we lost the trail for a while. On our return we were able to follow it back and found where we`d gone wrong. The same blunder happened with friends who went out after us. So I would say it could use slightly better demarcation in one of two areas, but other than that it is very well done.I would recommend it, it`s a great way to get exercise and it`s a beautiful ride.",TBRx
40,"Awesome path, just needs a few more signs","The bike path is fantastic and I had a really enjoyable couple of hours pedaling along the beautiful southern Californian coastline. Don't expect this to be a training run for solid cyclists as it tends to have too many walkers and joggers treading the path as well as the odd kid crossing to and from the beach. However, it is long enough for most people to get plenty of worthwhile exercise even at a slower pace. There are plenty of attractions along the way and places to stop and refresh. I took a wrong turn at one point and got lost for a while and I also got a little confused when the path merged with a road at one point before merging back onto the path. A few directional signs at key locations would be helpful.",Geoff M
50,I walked it.,Technically this is a bike path but I actually walked it. Seems much safer than the city streets. Very nice and scenic path. Takes you from one city to another. You don't have to do the entire path.,Flhappy

50,One of the Best things we did when visiting LA,"One of the best things we did on our trip to LA was drive out to Santa Monica and rented bikes for the day. Great experience and a truly enjoyable biking day along the beach. We grabbed lunch in town along the way. Lots of public restrooms along the beach. Beautiful, wide, paved path on the beach to bike.",Judy H
50,"Great exercise, Great fun.","My husband and I drove to Los Angeles to pick up my husband's brother and wife. They wanted to see Venus Beach, Muscle Beach, Santa Monica Pier and to eat at one of the local restaurants along the beach. What better way to do it than by bike. We rented bikes at Daniel's Bicycle Rentals and started off on the Marvin Braude Bike Trail portion of the 26 mile bike path. We then went to the Santa Monica Pier. It was easy to lock our bikes up wherever we went, and walk the pier, and other places also.In some places, for about 3-4 miles, the 26-mile bike path parallels Santa Monica Beach. In a couple of other places you are on the actual roadway with traffic, which is really freaky for me, but I survived by staying on the sidewalk in the scariest places for myself and my sister-in-law.We had to go the entire route, from Manhattan Beach to Venice beach and back. It was great fun and I highly recommend it. We stopped at Venice Whaler Bar and Grill for a fantastic fish taco lunch, served with a huge glob of guacamole.Read more: http://www.city-data.com/articles/26-Mile-Bike-Path.html#ixzz3lMaeEHdO",NickiG555
50,Fabulous ride through the whole spectrum of southern California beach life.,"While the exciting part of the trail takes you through Venice and Santa Monica on a dedicated bike path, a small jaunt around Marina del Rey is an adventure in longer rides.Note that the stretch from LAX to Palos Verde is much quieter. Riding past LAX there is a stretch of strand which is all barbeques and fire pits. The vastness of the beaches here create a sense of emptiness. Each community is different, and as you get to Manhattan Beach, the residential nature of the trail gives way to a bit more commerce.",The City Trekker
50,Great place to burn off some calories and enjoy the views,"Excellent, well-maintained and heavily used path. I was not alone on my 6 am run. I had other runners, bikers, bladers, walkers, and boot campers on the path with me. Loved the run which I've not done in several years. It's a pleasure to see how well it's maintained.",DGomez70
50,Amazing Ride!,"We rented bikes for a full day on Sunday so we could ride along the beach and visit other neighbouring cities. At first, we visited the Bike Center, which was the more popular rental place, closer to our hotel and the beach but found that the prices were higher ($30 full day rental) than another shop we had previously walked by so we decided to head to Santa Monica Bike Rental on 4th and Broadway, which was $15 for the whole day. Make sure to bring your picture ID as they need to hold onto it for the duration of the rental and they take cash only so make sure to bring that along as well. Your $15 includes your beach cruise, a basket and a lock. This was one of the best days we had so I would definitely recommend doing this!",kareVancouver_BC
40,Lovely ride,I'd highly recommend a ride down the bike path - a great way to get a feel of the beaches and neighborhoods.,Suzft
50,Great bike path but very crowded,"I have ridden and walked this bike and walk path several times. It is a nice bike path, once or twice for touring, and seeing the beach. If you rent a cruiser and take some drinks and some tunes, it can be a lot of fun. It is not great for exercising during peak hours as it is packed with people on bikes, people running, people roller skating and blading and many other things.It is a fun path and you can make it an afternoon or a whole day depending on what your appetite is.",J S

There are a couple of points to note:The majority of the path is traffic free, but there is a small on-road section around Marina Del Rey.The section between Venice Beach and Santa Monica Pier gets very busy, particularly during weekend afternoons.We prefer the other parts of the path.",x229
40,Early Morning Run,"Went for a run from Santa Monica to Venice Beach one morning.

40,Ride the bike in Santa Monica,Traversing the bike lane from the Santa Monica pier to marina del ray was very amusing and fun-to-do list if you are planning to visit Santa Monica because of its exclusive boke lane for people who love bicycling and along the way you get to smell the beach side and you can stop in every point were people usually go. Really fun-derful!,Uhlen T
50,"Blissful way to spend a few hours, and really interesting","We hired the bikes arouns noon, cycled 2 hours (including photo stops and getting a little lost around Venice) to Manhattan Beach, where we had lunch.Then 1.5 hrs back to Santa Monica. You could have travelled further, to Redondo, but we were in 100F heat and I have one who doesn't particularly like cycling!It was amazing to see how the beach-life changes, the incredible beachside properties, and generally see how LA beach life is lived!One point to note is that you should ideally have a map (available at our buke hire place in SM) as the route digresses from beach-side to inland and around the very pretty canal area of Venice before getting beach-side again at Marina del Rey/Long Beach.My favourite day of the holiday was doing this.",sbizzle

50,Great way to take in the beach area!,"Such a great way to see the sites along the beach and boardwalk and get excersise. You can rent bikes or skates all along the boardwalk and the pier for those that want to bike together they have the bike for two. I love to walk and take it all in, as you go along there is people singing and playing instruments, art, shops, restaurants to stop and take a breather. The path goes for miles so going north it quiets down and not so many people. south can have more people. You can even take a stroll on the santa monica pier for a break. Enjoy!",sday2014

Sometimes it gets a little congested and may be difficult for smaller children to bike on, my kids are older and managed to enjoy the ride. Stopped a number of places along the path to check out the local scenes. There are a number of public restrooms along the path as well as showers to wash off the sand.

50,A great way to see Vencie Beach and Santa Monica Beach,"My favorite part of our visit to Venice Beach was riding our bicycles along the beach. It was a fun ride from Venice Beach Pier to the Santa Monica Pier. You pass by Muscle Beach, various shops and street performers. None of the homeless people bothered us during the week we were there. There are restrooms along the way and facilities to rinse the sand off your feet. There is a place to change into your bathing suit at the Santa Monica Pier. Also, there are places to park your bikes. To be safe, I would lock my bike. The cheapest place to rent bikes that I found was between 19th and 21sth ave on ocean front walk in Venice Beach (Sorry, I forget the exact location and name). They had bikes for as little as $16 a day or even less per day if you rent by the week.",HarleyRider1948

Of course the ocean breez and sunshine are also enjoyable.",Victor H
40,Santa Monica to Torrance Beach life guard station,"Up early and hired a Trek road bike (not a beach cruiser) for a ride down the beach path to Torrance. I had been told that the beach houses on Manhattan Beach are something to see! The only confusing part of the ride is when you come off the beach at Venice Pier and need to skirt around Marina Del Rey. Try to stay on Washington Blvd until Via Marina (turn Right) and then (Left) on to Admiralty Way. Follow that and you should pick up the Cycle Path on the right hand side of the road. Follow that to Fiji Way and (Turn Right) further down you are cycling on a spit of land with the harbour on the right and a canal on the left. there is a bridge that that crosses the canal and you are now on the cycle path for the next 8 miles or so.The path is clear and clean. Early in the morning (07:00 start) there is not too much open, but still lots of people running, cycling and dragging beach toys out of 4X4s.Although pretty much flat it is an enjoyable ride with plenty to see and a changing view as you pass the Marina, LAX, LA's water facility, El Segundo (there's a Robbie Williams reference in there) and on to Manhattan Beach. And they were right, some of these houses are amazing, others well not my taste.The ride there and back took about 1 hour forty five minutes, but if it were later in the day, I am sure I would have stopped for coffee and cake, but I had the family to get back to and breakfast somewhere yummy in Santa Monica.A good ride with wonderful weather.",Simon M
50,a must do!,"AMAZING. this was the best way to spend a morning (before the sun gets too hot!) we cycled from Santa Monica to Venice Beach, stopping every so often for photos, then back and up north of Santa Monica.

My family and I were staying in Santa Monica and my friend came with us, only my friend and I set of to ride bikes while my parents decided to relax at the pool!!Our hotel rented out bikes however there are places along the bike trail where you can rent them and there are many options, don't necessarily feel the need to ride a BIKE, there were several people with Go Karts, scooters, skate boards, roller skates etc.The atmosphere and the views are amazing, we only rode for 1.5 hours and most definitely were not planning on completing the whole trail, haha! But its a great option to help get to know the area and experience the real californian crazy atmosphere as it is also a great place to ride if you are more of a pro. Its a great place for everyone.Riding past muscle beach was fantastic, seeing everyone from fitness freaks to small children join in with the tightropes, bars and activities, another crazy fun place is of course the santa Monica pier which is great to stop of to catch in some rides, a spot of lunch or an ice cream.It is an easy ride as it lis flat ground however constantly busy. Do not expect people to move out of your way, because they won't. The little tool known as a bell on most bike handles does not come in handy as no one listens to it which was slightly annoying but the overall experience was a lot of fun and worth it!",Hannah B

40,fun 1.5 hours,We rented bikes with our kids and loved cruising the path. It was about 6 pm so it was a little too crowded though. Go earlier if you can.

A great ride all the way to Malibu where unfortunately you would need to get onto the PCH to continue.",Patrick M
50,Great bike path along the beach,"Great windy bike path along the beach from Redondo Beach to Santa Monica. From Rosecrans in Manhattan Beach I rode north around Marina Del Rey to Washington Blvd and down to the start of Venice Beach, a nice 10 mile ride.Then from Washington Blvd north to Santa Monica is one of the most famous stretches of beach in the world containing Muscle Beach, Venice Boardwalk (all cement of course) and dozens of shops, restaurants and vendors of everything. One ride I took about 6 months months ago there were 3 different filming locations setup and active. Months later I saw the comercial that had been filming as I rode by. Wow!!

The trail is great, but dodging walkers, strollers, skateboarders, and other people who I don't think should be on this path was tricky for my daughter, who isn't a confident rider.I was also getting frustrated by one ""serious cyclist"" who was going back and forth as quickly as he could, yelling at everyone who he thought was doing the wrong thing. I used to be a serious cyclist. You know where I rode? I rode in the hills and mountains with challenging terrain. I think there's some of that in California. You know where I didn't ride? I didn't ride on the busiest, most touristy street in my town.",John S

50,Great cycling in the sunshine,"We are a family of 4 (parents and two teens). None of us are regular cyclists. We hired bikes at the Santa Monica Bike Centre. The beach cycle path is mainly flat, so not hard going. It was hot (sun cream is a must), but really pleasant to cycle along. You can choose your pace. You need to go on the road to get round the harbour at Marina Del Rey, but there are bike lanes on the roads so it is ok, even for an inexperienced cyclist. We stopped for lunch at a little surf place on El Segundo beach (which served a decent range of food) and decided to head back. With a stop off for a wander at Venice Beach on the way out and on the way back, as well as lunch, we spent about 6 leisurely hours. A really enjoyable day.",Diane B
50,Great People Watching Ride,"Great ride. Will be crowded with various levels and types of bikers, skaters and runners Get off the path and walk the bikes through pedestrian shopping area of Venice on your way back. Only way to see basketball courts used in ""White Men Can't Jump"" and muscle beach. As well as all the great people watching in Venice and Santa Monica",Frank F
40,Great family bike ride,Great views of the oceans other cyclastists were very nice and helpful only problem is one part of it is very confusing and we ending up doing a 2 mile detour,Jeff F

50,things to do in santa monica,loved how the bike bath wound you through beach and town.. Great access to many different areas.. Really enjoyed it,tskelly
50,Riding on the Strand,The path is nice and flat and goes right along the beach. It was an easy ride but somewhat crowded so best to early in the morning.,Bill G
40,Great way to tour,"We did a Segway Tour down the bike path. It was great! We only had a few days in the city and never imaged we'd be able to see so much. We saw surfers and volley ball players and skateboarders (great skateboard park on the route). Runners, walkers, bikers, Segways, skateboards. Any way you want to go - it definitely gives you a good look at the variety of life that is available in California! Bring your camera! There are things that aren't to be missed. You could spend the day strolling or an hour on a run. It's all up to you. You'll find places off the path to stop and visit, if you so desire.",Lissy0717
50,Good 5 mile run,"I was with my family for a day at the beach. Since we were travelling from the midwest I took the opportunity to get my daily run in. It was so much fun running along the coast and the path was perfect to do so. I saw so many interesting places and people, would highly recommend for a run or bike ride.",iroamaround67801
50,A MUST DO,Biked all the way from Santa Monica to Venice Beach and back. Such a wonderful experience. A must do when visiting Santa Monica. They have bike rentals at $20 per day or by the hour. Really good deal for your buck. Awesome bike ride!,Goldenbluize
50,Bike till you drop,"One of my favorite all time activities is riding a bike forever on this amazing endless path. Go North, go South, it doesn't matter!",egrade
50,Healthy and fun!,A few minute walk from most hotels in the area. Rent a bike right on the strip. The bike path runs all the way to the crazy Venice Beach. Great for a bike ride or run. Beautiful weather and view.,JessicaSummer
50,So Much Fun in The Sun,"Take your time and enjoy the day. Lots of fun in the Sun. Travel through Venice and on to Marina Del Rey. You Can rent bikes and they seem to be a tad cheaper off the boardwalk. Either way, take a few hours and enjoy the ride!",NYLivinLAdreamin
40,Great way to see the coastline,Initially we had a lot of difficulty getting these bikes out of their stands as the machines were faulty & we needed to try several different stands. We were 5 & found this a great way to cover several kilometres along the boardwalk. Lots of people near Santa Monica beach on the boardwalk but as it is wide no problem to share with roller bladers etc.Some stunning homes along the coastline & plenty to see as you cruise along on your bike.,Wendy w
50,Lovely Path,We did the whole path and loved it! Stopping en route for food and drinks. A beautiful way to experience the coast.,LovinEveryMinute
40,Asfalt on the beach,"We'll all been there, found a nice beach and want to take a run or riding a bike, but as we all know, it's really hard to ride a bicycle in the sand.The solution is a 26-mile bike path that runs next to the beach so you can get the feeling on being on the beach, see the ocean but still be able to use your bicycle.Lots of places to rent a bicycle and plenty of people using this path.",DanielHenrysson
50,Great for biking or jogging,"Beautiful views of the beach and ocean, though watch for pedestrians crossing. Clean public restrooms and drinking fountains near the north end of the path.",Julie M
50,Amazing ride,"Great chance to cruise with the beautiful - and not so beautiful - people. No need to exert yourself. We mooched after a late start and still made it from the Santa Monica Pier down to Manhattan Beach and back over an afternoon, spinning tales as we did so about the occupants of the beachfront houses and apartments. Plenty of places for great photos - and apart from navigating the marina del rey everything was easy peasy on the bikes.",LucienOSS
50,Great morning exercise,"Loved going for some early morning activities!!! I didn't have any dislikes! In fact, there are so many fun things to do along this great area. You can even meditate and enjoy the peacefulness of the ocean.",Alex T
50,Could've spent the whole day here!,"We all enjoyed our walk alongside (and on it when necessary) from the pier for a few miles. There's just no place like this on the east coast where we live, and it was very enjoyable! The breeze, the people watching, and gorgeous views are all amazing here!We are planning another longer trip to this area, so we can bike the whole path!",Kathy M
50,Strand...Great trip,"We do about 22 miles of the 26...we turn around at Will Rogers beach then ride back thru Venice, the Marina, Dockwieler, Manhattan, Hermosa, Redondo down to Torrance beach. Each community is unique with plenty to see. Lots of good food stops. Water and bathrooms along the way. Most of the way you are right along side the ocean. Fantastic experience",Jud J
40,Heavily exercise,What a wonderful way to get in a little exercise . We hired bikes for an hr and cycled to Venice beach . Stopping at a cafe playing jazz along the way . There are unfortunately a few cyclist who are going to fast and want to get past you without prior warnings,Merle h
50,"Ride, Run and even Walk the Bay","I was on the bike path today in Santa Monica, just before the 4th of July weekend. It is crowded but fun. I've lived on or near the path for over 30 years. If you are into a fast bike ride get up early in the morning and start at the north end and go all the way to the south in Torrance (26 miles). When you get there turn around and go back to State Beach (50+ miles in 5 hours!). If you want to make a day of it then start at the Santa Monica Pier and go to Venice (45 min walk/15 min bike) in the late morning. Take a quick look at things along the famous Venice Boardwalk and then move on around the boats to the south at Marina Del Rey. Stop at Fisherman's Village (1 hour walk/30 minutes bike). If you are walking you might want to turn around here and head back to Venice. After you leave there on your bike as you head south to Manhattan Beach you will be in the flight path of LAX. You'll see the jumbos just a couple of thousand feet above you heading for Asia, Australia and South America. When you get to Manhattan Beach (1 hour past Fisherman's Village) have some drinks above the Pier or watch some volleyball. Now, head back to Venice for your sunset.",Mitchel N
50,Must do when in LA,"Great way toSpend a few hours, parked at Santa Monica pier and walked along down to Venice beach, great vibe and lots of peopleWatching.",Barry D
50,"Awesome, loved it!","Great bike path, lots of people and interesting sights. We had a great time, the whole family loved it and can't wait to do it again!",Renaesmart
50,Best in LA,"After a pleasant drive around Beverly Hills and exhausting walk along Hollywood blvd, Santa Monica bike ride is just the best place to be. Although the bike path ends at the half way to Malibu, there are plenty of breathtaking views before the final point.",Elena_travaller
50,The best thing around - leisure or exercise,"You can ride all the way: from the south to north - Palos Verdes, Redondo, Hermosa, Manhattan, El Segundo, Playa del Rey, Marina Del Rey, Venice, Santa Monica, edge of Pacific Palisades. Our favorite is the MDR-Palos Verdes part because it has a bit less traffic on the weekend, there are a ton of places to stop and eat (try the fish market in Redondo!) - always be sure to take your locks. On weekends, stay away from MDR-Venice-Santa Monica route and definitely don't do it with young kids - you have to stay very aware, especially of pedestrians on the bike path, crossing to get to beaches. No matter how hot it is elsewhere, there's always a cool breeze on the path. Pull over to the rocks and watch the surfers in the Manhattan Beach area. Watch the boats go in and out of the channel at Marina Del Rey. Parts of the ""path"" are on the main streets (Washington Blvd in MDR/Venice), also in Hermosa/Redondo - but they are almost all marked bikeways. Mostly flat but a few hills. If you don't stop to eat, there are plenty of beach restrooms if you need.",a-travelin-foodie
50,A leisurely bike ride with plenty to see,The ride was very easy and flat. We hired bikes across the road from our hotel. Their price perhaps $15 for 4 hours. The bikes were in good order and we had lots of fun stopping at Muscle Beach etc. A great activity if you enjoy riding.,Jeff G
40,Great for walking too!!,"A wonderful wide cement path for bikes, roller bladers and walkers that winds alongside the beach. Gorgeous to be beside the sand and the sea, beautiful at sunset. Not so nice at the Venice Beach end, but South and north of Santa Monica it's highly recommended. We enjoyed most early In the morning, when it was fairly quiet and deserted",Deena63
40,What a great feature,This was so nice to have a paved walking area to get around. We enjoyed walking to Venice Beach and along Santa Monica to see the sunset without getting sand in our shoes :),Neekster
40,Great for various activities,"A great way to exercise along the beachfront with mostly beautiful views. You will find bikers, rollerbladders, skateboarders, etc. using the path throughout the day. Avoid the Venice area and south. Stick to Santa Monica and north. Much nicer.",vittoriarenee
50,So refreshing.,Anytime I am in town I do my best to make it to the bike path. It's so relaxing to cruise up and down the beach at your own leisure. I usually go from Marina Del Ray/Venice up past Santa Monica. The ocean always cools you off and it's always fun to people watch a little bit.I've seen Dolphins in the ocean and I've seen Kevin Bacon all while riding bikes here.You never know WHAT you'll see! Haha,SizzleBean
50,A relaxing and enjoyable trip,"We hired bikes in Santa Monica and did the route South to Venice Beach and then North to Will Rogers beach. The path is very flat and we went on a week day mid morning so it wasn't crowded, this made it a very relaxed trip.We stopped at Back on the Beach Cafe (near Annenberg community Beach House) which served a good burger for lunch.We went on the roads briefly at Venice, but didn't go as far as the bike path at marina del rey. The roads are fine to cycle on for confident cyclists but the beach path (up to Venice Beach) is much more enjoyable and relaxing.",Mefgreg
50,Great bike path for viewing beach and people,"Easy and not expensive to rent a bike. Very relaxing to ride along beach, and then stop for a beer of course.",flyingkdj
50,Keeping the blood going whilst enjoying your surroundings,"Santa Monica is my favourite place in the world, so this may come across a little biased, but it feels objective as I write. This stretch of path is an awesome way to see all of the best bits of LA beachfront housing whilst enjoying brilliant views of the ocean and dolphins following you along it. It also keeps your blood moving in an otherwise very calm/chilled atmosphere. I love getting a bike or skates from one of the two hire places just over from the Pier and then taking some time to travel up to Manhattan Beach for lunch. As you get passed the inlet next to Marina Del Ray the properties are fantastic: each being different from the next as well as a few being wacky and fun (a Spanish Galleon complete with wheel!). There are so many people out and about on weird and wonderful forms of transport too that you're never far from seeing something or someone amazing.",SHoweBathUK
40,North is nice. South is a little creepy.,"This trail is beautiful. I suggest riding it during a weekday. I do have to add that, the deeper into Venice, the more creepy the people we encountered on the trail. We were happy to turn around and head back to Santa Monica.",WorldTravelGoddess
50,Bicycle rental,Do a little research. We found bikes a few blocks from the beach for $15 a day. A lock was included. Most places charged by the hour.,Marie M
50,With the ride to Venice Beach,The Wyndham at Santa Monica provides bicycles if you're a Wyndham member. It's always worth a ride to Venice Beach to watch the weird and wonderful people it attracts!,Kerry P
50,brilliant!,We only used the stretch between Santa monica and Venice beach but it was great. Felt safe and breathtaking views.,Termer13
40,Santa Monica to venice,This walk you're able to leave shoes on or not! Great people watching opportunity. Bike it or walk or skate all possible on these paths.,Leona S
50,Highlight of our trip,"Best part of our vacation!Fun & enjoyable on easy to use, smooth bikes in wonderful colors.Our guide, Steve, was so knowledgeable & gave us the history of each area we went to & even had photos on hand.It was a flat ride, not very long spent on streets, got to see muscle beach, William Randolph Hurst's beach house, Venice & the canals, Santa Monica pier & carousel.It was a nice cool morning, it is a must-do!Don't let the 26-mile scare you, it's easily done & fun & educational!!",Lynn B
50,FIT bike ride,its the best way to get around and see the beach side of Santa Monica and Venice Beach and anyone can do it leisurely.. just make sure you wear a helmet!,ccuizon
50,Family Fun!,"The bike ride was most relaxing and enjoyable. We biked slowly so we could enjoy the nice sea breeze, warm sun, and the perfect temperature. It was also a good way to people watch and see different parts on the Santa Monica beach and Venice beach.",Peter1030
40,Bike Path also has Pedestrian Path,"I love walking the Santa Monica Beach on the 26-Mile Bike Path as their is an adjacent Pedestrian Path. I walk from Pacific Palisades to Venice, a real vigorous exercise with a view of the beach, with little cafes & little beach shops from Santa Monica to Venice. Street Vendors in Venice sell art & other cool items along this path. The incredible views of the beach alone are worth it. Weekends for cyclist can be insanely busy. Weekdays are relaxing. The path has plenty of Public Restrooms & places to stop & enjoy the beach. If you need to rent a bike there are several locations to rent all different styles of bike. You can also rent rollerblades and kayaks.",Akiko A
50,Beautiful place to exercise,"I ran along this place everyday when I stayed in Santa Monica this weekend. Next time I return I will definitely rent a bike for it, too. The views are great and the path is very smooth and well maintained. Of course, because it is such a special place, it gets pretty crowded, but nothing I couldn't work around.",Tom W
40,Nice Easy Walk at Beach Level-But Lots of Homeless,"Walked from Santa Monica to Venice Beach. Nice, flat, easy walk. Places to eat along the way. Unfortunately, there are lots of homeless.",xnewyauka
50,I wished it could last forever,"It doesn't matter if you are fit or not, the bike path alond Monica Beach and beyond it's a must! You will find all sort of people along the way. Running, skating, walking, dancing, singing doing exercises of all sort. If you need to stop for a toilet you will find lots on the way. .. I loved it I wish I could do it every day",dandani08
50,Must do!,"Walking the beach is fine, but cycling is better. Excellent bike path that has changing landside views of everything from exclusive apartments to the freaksville of Venice Beach and the tacky Santa Monica Pier. Hire a bike and go for it, but don't forget you have to ride back to where the bike was hired. Bike hire prices vary at different places along the beach from $10 an hour at Ocean Shores to $7 at Santa Monica and Venice Beach. Much quieter and enjoyable on week days than with huge crowds on summer weekends.",Warwick C
40,Flat and Easy,Worth hiring a bike for but once you get to Marina Del Rey but once you get to Marina Del Rey you have to go on the road which was a bit scary with our kids. However there is a cycle lane and the bike path is well sign-posted and maintained.,DonnaKeebab
50,A great way to spend a half day - and getting some exercise.,"What a great way to spend a few hours. Rent a bike at the place under Santa Monica Pier, with a front basket for your stuff, and a lock so you can stop and park along the way, and off you go. Venice Beach is a bohemian must see place to stop and wander around, including the canals and Muscle Beach and then head to the more exclusive and quieter Marina Del Rey. Watch all the outdoor activities and enjoy some good food and drink.",RogerB2000
50,WONDERFUL BIKE TRIP TO HERMOSA AND BACK,We love doing this bike ride every 2 years or so. You can bike all the way from Santa Monica to Hermosa and even further. Be careful in Venice Beach where you will have to bike the streets for a mile or 2. We take lunch in Hermosa (several good options) and then go back. Just wonderful on a Sunny day.,JoepMens
30,"worth doing, but keep your eyes open","Cycling along the beach is a lovely way to see a lot of Santa Monica and Venice Beach.However, people are floating everywhere on the bike path, crossing and cutting you off. Just don't expect to get anywhere in a hurry and be aware of wandering locals and tourists who could take you out.",Rednessie23
50,Santa Monica to Marina Del Ray and Back,The concrete cycle path is right on the beach and you can cycle a small or large distance. It is safe for any cycling capability and you can easily stop and start to take in any attractions or craft stalls that take your fancy. The Marina at the end of the trip is a great area particularly if you like looking at great cruisers and yachts,Paul H
50,Great,"Very good for a ride! If you don't have a bike, you can rent one. There are a lot of rental shops near the path.",Avalenca
50,Well worth doing,Very well designed and smooth bike path - pleasure to cycle along taking in the views. We cycled from West Channel Road all the way to Marina Del Rey and it was beautiful.,Cathy S
50,Get exercise while watching the crowds,Santa Monica's bike path is a must for visitors and locals. Weather is always great while you ride past all of the interesting attractions including the famous pier and muscle beach. You can rent a bike or a Segway if you do not have your own ride.,Susan90405
30,A nice ride but don't expect seafront all the way,We rented bikes and set off on this bike trail from Santa Monica towards Venice beach. We went as far as the Ballona wetlands which are just after Marina del Rey. The bike path veers off down some more regular routes in order to get around the Marina. We got a bit lost on the way and ended up cycling what seemed to be a long meandering way around the marina and through some nice neighborhoods. We kept to the trail on the way back and it was much faster.,ParisFifi
50,Beautiful bike path over looking ocean,The views are to die for. They are absolutely wonderful. Imagine a bike path that is on the ocean? It just does not get better than that.,AnthonyAlegrete
40,Lots of fun,"My friend and I had a great afternoon riding along the bike path from Santa Monica to Venice Beach and back. It is a well built path and lots of fun. There were A LOT of people on this path which made it difficult at times especially when groups of girls looking at their cellphones or bunches of self-important muscle men just wander down the middle of the 'bike path' without any recognition of the people on actual bikes using the path. But that aside, it is definitely a fun thing to do and a good way to get outdoors with the family/friends.My tip is to wander down the path a bit before hiring your bikes. We got ours from the first place we saw right by Muscle Beach, we (fortunately) got their last bikes. But on our travels further down the trail there were many more bike rental places with lots of bikes (and potentially cheaper prices) on display.",Hayley R
50,"Great ride, family friendly","Staying at Santa Monica and wanting to have a leisurely day sightseeing, we hired three wheeler bikes (I suffer from vertigo so these bikes were perfect) and we rode from Santa Monica Pier to the end of the Venice Beach stalls.Definitely one of the most fun days sightseeing and a great way to check out Muscle Beach, the iconic ""Baywatch"" lifesavers towers and the general hustle and bustle along the bike path. Would probably be quicker by normal bike but loved every minute (although my legs were rather sore the next day!). Loved being able to stop whenever we felt like it and took advantage by stopping at the market stalls, watching the buff muscle men, and eating the most delicious sorbet I've had anywhere. Just a great, easy fun ride!Highly recommend this to anyone, you can spend a couple of hours or take all day - just remember to take sunscreen as we all got burnt even on an overcast day!",Christy B
50,The Strand bike path,"The whole family rented bikes at the pier, we had a great time riding along the bike path. Highly recommend visiting the venice canals (you have to walk your bike but it is so peaceful)",annsE3962TK
30,Beware of scofflaws,"By law, and by signage, this is a BIKE PATH. In places the pavement is marked ""BIKES ONLY"". But there are a plethora of others who use the path and police rarely enforce the law in this case.There are many pedestrians, joggers, dog walkers with the leash draped across the path, skate boarders, minimally supervised children.Many of these scofflaws do not watch where they are going and create a hazard for cyclists. I agree with the advantages of the path touted by other reviewers, but I never ride the path any more because of the hazards and because I'm just supremely annoyed by the scofflaws. Now I ride the Palos Verdes Peninsua and the Santa Monica Mountains.If you do decide to ride the path beware of the risks. I used to ride the path every weekend and witnessed several bike crashes.",lzzzz
40,Pier to pier,Great fun but too many people to go fast. Started in Santa Monica and stopped in Marina Del Ray. Cows end coffee shop has wonderful coffee and sandwiches,georgemor
40,Very cool!,"We didn't ride the trail but walked alongside a good portion of it. Because there's a separate path for walkers, there is plenty of space for bikes to pass each other as it quite wide. I wouldn't ride here if I was a serious/professional cyclist but definitely for a casual ride this is ideal. Just keep an eye out for pedestrians crossing and make sure your bell works!",MikeStrachan
40,"One of those ""got to do it"" experiences","Such a relaxing way to enjoy this coast line and people watch at the same time. You can't help but relax and take a breath. We hit a sunny day, and being a Tuesday in April, not as busy as some days. Everyone seemed easy going - I went reasonably slow as just soaking it up, whilst my boys might speed along and pass people. Various music or musicians along the way to relax too, I would definitely recommend this. Easy to hire bikes in lots of spots - we got them just down from the pier at $7 an hour, best thing is that you don't have to decide how long you will have them - so you can decide while you are out - max for a day was $20 per bike. Only thing I found a bit unsettling was the number of homeless people around, as when I wanted to stop and sit there was generally someone there, and I was wary with the kids particularly if my husband had gone on further. We found the Venice Beach shop fronts (by the cycle way) not that interesting, it all seemed to be the same, and not of that much quality - definitely for the tourists.",rosebeets
40,Very nice bike path,"Very nice bike path on the beach. We vacationed in Santa Monica in hopes to ride this bike path at least a few times for the great views and some exercise as well. We rented our bikes from SMC, Santa Monica bike center off of Colorado Street and they took very good care of us. The path itself was really fun and if you ride it all the way down to Redondo beach, most of it is on path with very little that you have to ride along the roadway. Everyone on the bike path seemed pretty courteous of one another helping with the right-of-way. The restaurant areas are separated by approximately 5 to 8 miles. You have your restaurants in Santa Monica, going south the next would be in the Venice Beach area, next would be at Manhattan Beach and finally in Redondo. Santa Monica and Manhattan Beach had the best restaurant selections by far. From Santa Monica to Redondo and back is about a 40 mile round-trip. We were able to get in about 20 miles each day. The earlier you can go the better it would be for less tourist congestion. Anyway it's a very fun trail and definitely worth the ride.",Weissman22
50,Nice Bike Ride,Biking down the beach was an excellent adventure. This path goes from Venice Beach and way past Santa Monica.,Tom F
50,Bike path sights,"Great way to get some exercise and see the sights. Very easy to stop and get something to eat, shop or just watch the nut cases that call the beachfront home.",Bruce M
50,A Great Relaxing Ride,Able to rent a tandem for my husband and son. I rode a coaster. Lots of fun taking in the sites :) Rented from Perrys - located along the stretch. They also have great food for a bite to eat on the beach.,azd87
40,Be careful!,"This is a very crowded bike path, that is not really just for bikes... There are many skaters, and many walkers... Although I am not sure why the walkers don't walk on the walking path!? Many families w small children who are unsure of themselves and the bikes they are riding...this bike path is very dangerous!",Sara G
40,Great ride by the ocean,"Go to 2nd and Colorado, there's a bike rental there, their bikes are in much better shape then rentals on the beach and they cost the same if not less. The bike path is nice, watch for others. Much like driving, there are plenty of people on them, some pay no attention to others, some are too busy on their cell phones while biking, and some walk the path but shouldn't. But it's a great time, great way to see the area and the ocean.",JB travels
50,Loved this Bike Path,"Sure, I love a good hard ride through the wilderness. But who doesn't love a leisurely ride along the beach?This was as good as it got for my family and I. There were more numerous bike rental shops to choose from, which helps for all those trying to stretch their dollar. But once you get that part of the equation taken care of, the rest is just heavenly. Depending on the time of day, day of the week, etc...sure, this attraction can get somewhat crowded. But it's so much worth the time when your mind and body need a break from the stresses of the world. We definitely loved it, and it was a nice and inexpensive family q-time session.Would definitely recommend it to others.",J E
50,This is one of the best bike paths,"This is an amazing riding path.fresh air and long distances, plenty of places to stop and rest, and also, a number of rental services along the way",srimanone
50,Great exercise- beautiful scenery,You can travel to Malibu or the other direction to Venice. You ride along a path that is only for bikes so it is safe. Some of the bikes you rent are not easy to ride so make sure you get a good bike.,carolschaefer
40,Guaranteed a good ride but allow time to get back,"This is a very appealing ride set against the Pacific back drop and sold as the dedicated bike route . However there are certain aspects to take into consideration. make sure you hire one of the more decent bikes with proper gears and check that the saddle won't move once you have altered the height. These bikes are very over used. Most of the distance is from the Santa Monica Pier to Torrance Beach . From the pier to Venice you will be avoiding the walkers, rollerbladers and the occasional child that wonders in your way plus the cyclists who meander so be patient and enjoy the surrounds . When you get to Venice the trail stops and takes you on the road along a cycle path next to traffic who frankly would prefer that you were not there. Do be careful and watch out for the turning off Washington Boulevard just after the Garden Hilton hotel . It is not obvious . This path takes you round the Marina del Rey and eventually onto a canal that leads to the beach path . Once you get to the canal it is all very pretty and you will cycle past the airport and eventually get to Torrence . Of course you know that this is not a circular ride so allow time to retrace your tracks and head back to Santa Monica .Take water with you and have comfortable clothes . This is quite an energetic ride even though it is flat and the ride along the beach path can be very windy . Enjoy",Lynne G
50,Fantastic way to experience the beach scene,"We rode from Redondo beach to Santa Monica and back on a three speed in about five hours. We hired the bikes from marina bike rentals in Redondo beach. They are good, and it was great that they have their own free parking which otherwise would have been an added expense.Riding on a bike up the coast let's you set your own pace to suit the stuff going on. Dawdle past the interesting sea front houses, and volley ball games, where the path is busy with walkers, joggers, skaters, other bikers and mums with buggies. Race along past the industrial bits. I liked the way the path was interesting even along deserted beach stretches, where it rises and falls and curves around the sand.Cost us about 30 dollars each for a memorable day.",peter s
50,a must do in Santa Monica,"We were there in early spring, the beach was deserted so we had vast acres of sand, blue skies, cool air and a wonderful ride up and down the coast.",GethenWellington
40,Southern California!!,"Nothing like biking gently on the flat and well maintained bike path - it starts by Washington Blvd in Venice, and takes you all the up to Will Rogers Beach in Pacific Palisades. Crossing in front of multi million beach houses, the tourist attractions on Venice Beach, Santa Monica pier, and the beaches along the way, the bike path is probably one of the best ways to sightsee and people watch on the coast. Bike rental places are plentiful along the path, there are some decent food joints (don't expect much, and the prices are a bit on the high side - it is a tourist attraction, after all), but the best is actually the cold breeze throughout the year from the ocean. Just watch out for the runners on the path (the path is supposedly only for bikers, but you will see joggers, skaters, and baby strollers).",Michael K
50,Great Time,"My teenage son and I decided to rent bikes and go up and down the coast. What a great experience. So many different things to see, the volleyball games to venice beach and its eclectic shops then to the pier and so much more to see. It was a great way to see all the different areas of the beach towns. Absolutely worth the time in anyone's vacation.",Lifeisatrip4me
40,Beautiful space and pretty decent seafood,"only issue, is crowded, sometimes tough to park and too expensive. though, right at the entrance of the pier, so park here (got to pay), have a ""happy hour"" drink, then walk down onto the pier for a more reasonably priced meal.",pandpCalifornia
50,Fun run.,"I enjoy taking in the local sights on a run and there's plenty to see up and down this beach side path - from the color of Venice, to the specticle of Muscle Beach, and the fun of Santa Monica Pier, the scenery should keep most runners well-entertained while clocking the miles.",BUgrad85

50,Great for Exercise and Sightseeing!,"If you like to bike and enjoy nature, go visit the bike path. There are rentals where you can rent bikes (solo, tandem, you name it). Along the way, we pass through many skateboard parks, volleyball courts, shops, and lovely houses. The view of the ocean is amazing.",Alysta L
50,Fun Biking!,Great path very quiet early in the morning. We went from Santa Monica to Venice Beach. Enjoyed it a lot!,Stacey H
50,Great way to spend a day!,We rented bikes and spent the whole day! Great fun riding from one beach to the next. Be careful in the busy areas around the Pier and Venice Beach. Lots of pedestrians make maneuvering the pathway challenging. Stop at Venice Beach and lock up your bikes and shop and eat at all the vendors. You may even see a glass walker!,abcdef_99
40,Flat and easy,"Great way to really get to know coastal LA.Be careful around the busy hubs where pedestrians and bikes meet, especially around Manhattan Beach, and Hermosa.....where you either need to lift your bike up a few stairs, or ride on the street behind the beach",Lisa V
40,Nice ride,Biggest problem is finding where the path continues going South once you get through Venice. It is not marked any place I could find.,MODIAM
20,No enforcement,Pedestrians have taken over the bike paths and the police are not doing anything about it. Bikers have little or no space to ride and pedestrians are rude and have overblown senses of entitlement.It's another good idea gone wrong because of lack of supervision and enforcement.,Jack C
50,Great healthy way to see numerous beaches,"Although I do not live in L.A., I keep a bicycle with a friend who lives in Venice Beach, and ride this route every time I can, when visiting So. Cal. Beautiful views, and a great and not too challenging ride.Rent a Bike. You will Love It!",MaryBethEss
50,A glimpse of California,"You have to do this, just rent a bike and start peddling. I recommend Sea Mist Rentals near Santa Monica Pear, $18.00 dollars all day. Don't forget your camera!",majomaol
50,This is a must do when in Santa Monica!,Definitely have to do this. Amazing views and great way to see all the different areas around Santa Monica. This was my favourite thing I done when i was in LA. Wish I was back there on the bikes. Truly amazing experience.,Louise A
50,Pretty views in city life,"If you are looking for that typical SoCal life then this is the place to be. Tourists and locals flock to this path for its amazing views and fabulous location. You'll be dodging all sorts of human obstacles like bikes, strollers, scooters, skaters, walkers, runners, children playing and just about anything else you may or may not expect at the beach.",Haute Travel Girl
50,Great scenic ride,"Great ride along the beach to experience Santa Monica, Venice, Marina del Rey, Segundo Beach and Mahattan Beach! The ride is pretty flat so you can do it on a cruiser or a 10 speed bike.",Yogajohnny
50,Easier by bike,It's so easy to hire a bike and see the sights that way. The path is flat so the ride is easy and you can stop and eat and drink along the path. You can even do something strenuous when you get to Muscle Beach!.,Willo04
50,Great trail!,"This is a great trail, I love that fact pedestrians have one trail and bikes have another trail. A couple different places you have to dodge people but not too many. We started at Will Rogers State Beach and rode south. At Venice Pier the trail seems to end. To re-connect to the bike trail ride up Washington Blvd (you are sharing the road with cars) about 3 or 4 signals. At one of the lights, look to your ride and you will see the bike trail again. It was next to a green construction fence. Enjoy the ride.",J P
50,AWESOME!!!,"I loved this patch along the Santa Monica pier. I would move here just for that! It's a runners or cycler's dream! wide, long, beautiful view, Muscle Beach, what more could an athlete ask for??",Shmoopy_12
40,Great long bike path,"Nice long uninterrupted path to the beach, easy on/off from many major streets where you can join from home or park and hop on. Sometimes harder when there are a lot of pedestrians walking on the bike part of the path, also not a super wide path. Fine when there are others later in the day, but would not go alone in early morning (as a woman).",TriGirlLA
50,bike ride,we cycled from santa monica to venice beach making stops along the way. stopped at shutters for lunch which was a perfect pit stop. be careful if you have kids that like to cycle ahead as there are colourful characters along the way!!,Purplebunny24
50,Cool!,"If you love active recreation, whether it be the bicycle, run or walking, being in Santa Monica, I recommend to overcome this route in whole or in part! It is the longest way in the world passing along the ocean. You will be able to see noisy and cheerful Venice Beach, respectable Manhattan Beach, the surfers who are catching a wave, and flying up directly over the head of huge airliners. The good mood and excellent types are guaranteed to you!",Sergey Shestakov
50,Great path,"smooth, well maintained, heavily used, and totally worth every second spent on it. An easy way to visit Santa Monica and Venice beaches",sequitur
50,Excercise and fun in one!,I have always wanted to go for a bike ride along the beach and finally can tick that one off the list. It wasca perfect day and a ride to Venice beach for a look around then onto the pier lookout and back...2 hours and cheap entertainment.,melinda e
50,Go early in the morning to avoid the madness!,The scenery is breathtaking. The pedestrians on the bike-only path are not aware of traffic sometimes.,bikerchick66
50,Good fun ride,Very good fun ride with kids on a nice day. The environment needs an update though LA. Venice beach environment is a disgrace!,Murray F
30,Misleading,"We started at the top end of Santa Monica with bikes from our hotel, the the path is excellent and goes along the beach, we were super psyched to do all 26 miles however when you get to Venice the path on the beach comes to an end and there is a sign which says dismount. We followed the cycle sign arrow onto a busy road where the path continues. I thought the path went all the way down the side of the beach where there would be no cars. We followed the path which then split and the route we took the path just ended. We then had no idea where the path went or if it joined back on the beach so we just turned round and went back. We probably cycled about 8 miles there and back. I have no idea why they stop the path as there is plenty of room on the beach to continue it along. I am not a fan of cycling in traffic so wouldn't recommend this.",Out And About With Liz
40,Scenic route,"If you want an easy, gorgeous bike ride directly on the beach..this is for you! Anyone can bike this route that stretches for miles along the beach and by many great spots…Santa Monica, Venice Beach etc..It is VERY busy so you need to be very alert and pay attention but so worth renting bikes for a few hours!",Lisa K
50,Wonderful Afternoon,"Be sure to set aside time to rent bikes and travel all or just some of this path. With several options for bike rentals, it's easy and reasonable. It is nice to be on a bike when traveling through some of the homeless camping areas.",Tiffany H
50,Rent a Bike and Enjoy the Ride,"One of the major attractions of Santa Monica is the bike path. We love to hire bikes and go for a nice long bike ride in the mornings, and in the evenings go for a walk while the kids skateboard and rollerblade. Is a great way to enjoy the view, people watch, relax and get a little exercise.",tripgirl680
50,The Marvin Braude Trail!,Best bike trail in LA. Can ride all the way from from Santa Monica Beach to Manhattan Beach with gorgeous views all along.,Frindlerta
40,Bikes You've Never Seen,We love this biking trail. Great way to be at the ocean in often perfect weather weather (cool breeze with warm sun) and one of our favorite parts of this easy peasy ride is the variety of bikes and different ways people move on wheels.You have to see it to believe it!,CindyLeighCohn
50,"Fresh air, fun, bike and views",If you've never been to Santa Monica/Venice this is a do not miss. Bike along many miles of beach in a protected no car zone and/or designated bike path.,Sailtheworld2
40,Beach Cycle,Awesome stop an eat along the way. Cafes restaurants shops and swimming. Great for exercise enthusiasts and children with Santa Monica Pier not far,Monica T
50,That is 52-miles return!,"Must do. Lovely flat cycle path down the beaches. Each beach community has its own vibe from the crazyness of Venice, to the sailors of Playa del Rey and the yuppies of Manhattan!PS Its ""only"" 22.3 miles from Will Rogers Beach to Torrance Beach - and 22.3 back - no problem!",TonyVanDer
50,A must do in Santa Monica,"This is a great way to explore and enjoy the beach area. We biked from Santa Monica to Venice -- checked out Muscle Beach and walked around Venice Beach. We went over to Marina Del Rey, too. It's easy riding, and you get a great feel for ""California living.""",Amanda H
50,BEST WAY TO SEE EVERYTHING,Rented a pedal bike from Fisherman's Village for $7 per hour after parking for free in Dock 52 in Marina Del Rey. It is the BEST way to get around and see everything.,Nattysimps

50,Best Place to ride your bike,"Nothing beats taking your bike for a very easy, non-stenuous ride along one of the best coastlines in the US. Never gets too crowded that riding becomes a hassle. Plenty of interesting places to stop along the way for people-watching, food, etc. Can't be beat.",Polaroids & Drinkin Stories

50,Awe inspiring,"This is an amazing cycle route, I've never experienced one like it anywhere else. The views are incredible and it's easy to cycle 20+ miles without even noticing. Highly recommended.",RichS67
50,Bike The Beach,"If you are in Southern California, you simply must take the time to bike the beach on the boardwalk. I recommend starting in Santa Monica and make your way through Venice Beach and intoManhattan Beach. Great sights with lots to see and do.",Rob B
40,Very nice,"I was in Santa Monica for a conference and stayed at the Fairmont Miramar. They had complimentary bike rentals. I rode my bike from Santa Monica to Venice. It was so nice. I was there in mid Nov and the beach was not busy at all, almost deserted. Bike paths were created on the beach...so nice. Hope to come back again soon!",pammyvancouver
50,Great View,"A bike ride with an incredibly beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean from Santa Monica, Venice Beach, next to the iconic Boardwalk, Marina Del Rey to Redondo Beach. It's a long ride but well worth it and there are plenty of places to stop to shop and eat. Had a great time!",Marla57
50,Bike path,While on vacation in California I found my new happy place. It is bike riding on the 26 mile bike path along the beach. We stayed in Santa Monica which was pretty much in the middle. We rode to the end in both directions with Venice being our favorite spot. The weather was fabulous! My 13 year old daughter does not like to ride bikes. She was not interested in participating but because she was out numbered she came along. We rented a tandem for my husband and daughter and a single for myself. SHE LOVED IT. When we stopped at the Santa Monica Pier she kept pestering me to get back on the bikes. We ended up renting the bikes for 2 whole days!,Maureen R
40,A feast for the eyes,"Easy, flat ride that snakes along the beach by the PCH. It gets a bit crowded so you need to really pay attention to other bikers or pedestrians. It passes Muscle Beach and right into Venice so there's lots to see along the way. Just keep your eyes in front of you when you can. You may spot a celeb during their workout too! We rented from Perrys. It was about $20 for two bikes for an hour. They were closing or we may have gone for a little longer and rode thru Venice which is very pretty.",tanlinesallyear
40,Great path amazing views,Great path to ride/jog down with views over the beach the whole way. Lots of characters to see on the way with locals and tourists providing entertainment all down the beach. From buskers to magicians. A good way to get fit and see the coast.,Morrisguides
50,Best Bike Path in California,"Bring your bikes if you are going to be visiting any of the beach towns from Pacific Palisades to Palos Verdes. We live here, but often pretend we are tourists and try to see the bike path with new eyes. Nearly a half-century ride if you ride from one end to the other, and then back. No danger from traffic as only on the beach. Each beach has its own personality---with Manhattan's surf community at El Porto, great restaurants in Hermosa, pristine stretches with nothing in some places, and, of course, insane Venice to spark things up a bit. We usually reward ourselves with fish tacos at La Playita in Hermosa; a small, family friendly little cafe right off the Strand behind a small park. Wonderful with a Pacifico, and the chips are the best in LA. Rent a bike if you don't have one. But GO. Best free entertainment in LA!",AliLosAngeles
50,Its easy and flat!,I try to do this every time I visit LA. Rent a bike - get out and do it! It is the best way to experience the magnificent beaches that LA has. Lots of washrooms and cafes along the way to make the experience enjoyable.,Cindy_GoldenLake
50,Fabulous,"Joggers in packs, skaters, hordes of homeless waking up, cyclists, bikers, families running pushing prams.... The beach has it all in the early morning sunshine of a weekend day. The smog on the horizon can't be ignored, as the horizon was grey then blue instead of the clear blue one should expect, nor can the amount of trash from people living on the beach...",Passepartout1
30,Pedestrians!,"If you're on wheels watch out. Despite the many signs most pedestrians just don't seem to pay attention and wander all over and in the way and... They will cross without looking. Go real slow and it will be ok. Anyway, head south to Venice Beach. Lots going on. Feels like a carnival. Good fun. Go North and you reach Malibu beaches. Less crowded and nice big beaches. You'll find cafes and beach side restaurants along the way. Have fun.",Michael G
40,Nice but be careful,"This has to be one of the most scenic bike paths in the country if you like the beach. It also can be one of the most dangerous. Dangerous in the sense that cyclists have to share with skaters, parents pushing their babies in strollers, people walking their dogs on and off leash, areas of deep sand, etc.If I use this path it normally is during weekdays, not the weekend so traffic is at a minumum.",Bob P
50,Great Ride With A View,"Here's a bike ride with an incredibly beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean from Santa Monica, Venice Beach, next to the iconic Boardwalk, Marina Del Rey to Redondo Beach. It's a long ride but well worth it and there are plenty of places to stop to shop and eat. Be sure to return to Santa Monica around sunset because the pier at sunset is magnificent with the ocean view. You will be tired but excited that you had such a wonderful day.",Cori C
50,Beautiful Beachside Bike Ride!,"It's just about the best place to ride your bike or run at the beach! You can run in the sand, at the waves, and then back up to the path for as little or as much as you want. Stop for food, to shop, to stare at the oddballs in Venice or the performers along the way. Playgrounds, water fountains, juice bars, all there to give you a rest when you need it. They have some snazzy new bathrooms down there now as well. Bring a bike lock and a bell. Beware! the pedestrians tend to cross the path without paying any attention!!",Kellie H
50,Nice to bike all beach,"Great to rent bikes and cycle all beach front. Well organised, safe and fun. We cycled all the way one way and then walked back to see all the shops and local activity",Couldbeeating
40,A real parade!,"We travelled this path from north Santa Monica to Marina del Rey several times. walking and by bike. We enjoyed the sights and found lots of runners, joggers casual and racing cyclists. The path is busy and caution must be excercised. Many don't seem to understand what ""on the left!"" means and at times their are pedestrians in areas marked for bikes only. But it is beautiful and a nice way to get to the pier or Venice Beach without a car.",AEBlumberg
50,Perfect way to see the beaches,"My mom was pretty reluctant at first, thinking it might be to busy and so not easy to bike. We did it on a monday though, and it was not busy at all. It was amazing! The sunshine, the sea: it was just like in the movies. A must do!",Tessa
40,"Fun, Relaxing Scenic Bike Ride","I was pleasantly surprised that I did not see or hear any altercations, everyone was patient and shared the path. No road rage on this path.",74carrot
40,Go early and avoid crowds.,"My son (college student) and I rented our bikes from Sea Mist bike rentals under the Pier. Quick and easy process, like others have said. Take an extra ID, we were prepared thanks to TA reviewers. Get a basket and lock for sure. We started our ride at 10:45 on a Sunday morning and missed the crowds between SM and Venice, we rode to Manhattan Beach and had lunch (26 miles round trip). Absolutely stunning views along the way. The street portion in Venice to get around the marina is a little crazy and I was wishing I had a helmet, esp on the return when traffic was much heavier but it's doable and if you do not go south on the path out of Venice you've really missed a pretty part of the ride. Our return was around 4-4:30 and the stretch between Muscle Beach and SM pier was a nightmare, people, dogs, skate boarders and inexperienced bikers on the bike path. We avoided this in the morning thank goodness, was not really prepared for the hoards of people in the afternoon. Just be very careful, more than likely you will run off the path trying to avoid someone.",Travelmom29
50,Worth seeing!,"When you are in Santa Monica, you should definitely try out the 26-Mile Bike Path. It is a very nice activity. Rent a bike in one of the bike shops and go cruising. You will pass by some really nice houses, other town centers like Venice, the famous muscle beach etc. Be aware that close to Venice there is a section where the path shares the road with motorists.",derflieger2003
20,It's not all off the roads,"There is a significant stretch in Venice where you have to share the road with motorists who would prefer not to do so. Instead of going end to end, break it up by starting in Santa Monica, go to Pallasaides, stop by Patrick's Road House for lunch, turn around and ride to Venice Beach, turn around and return to Santa Monica. Bike rentals are available behind the Lowes Hotel. Then start your trip again in Redondo, ride up to Marina Del Rey and back down. It was a huge disappointment that the motorists were so disrespectful in Venice and ruined our hope of doing the whole trail in one day.",EZGoingTraveler10001
50,Great way to see the sights,We hired bikes from our hotel Shutters and cycled down to the end of Venice Beach at a very leisurely pace - great way to see the different neighbourhoods. Wear a hat if sunny - because you get a bit of a breeze when cycling you forget how hot the sun is!,TinaTpot
50,FANTASTIC,A cycle you won't forget... It goes through some of best towns and boardwalks in California. Rent a bike at many locations along the route and get peddling. Between Venice beach - Santa Monica will be the best people watching you'll ever see. Truly entertaining,royclarke61
40,Fun and interesting,Rented bikes at the top of the pier. Very convenient. Biked along the beach and over to Venice. So many neat things to see and just a fun experience. Very crowded on a Saturday but that's part of the fun :),Katy C
50,Great scenery,"We rented bikes and went for around 5 miles towards Venice Beach and beyond and then back to Santa Monica Pier. Absolutely fantastic, the wind in the hair, the sun, the beaches and the sights you remember from the series when you grew up. Can only recommend everyone to do this. We had the bikes for only an hour, which was a bit too short. You cannot bike fast due to all the ""traffic"" but it does not matter, you will have more time to soak in everything.",JeLundgren
50,Great for skating,"We skated a few miles of the path and it was gorgeous and flat, with amazing view! Would have liked to explore more",Lizzy B

You can easily go from venice, past santa monica, and further north. There is exercise equipment, swings, etc at Santa Monica beach. There are restaurants at different points along the path.

40,"Enjoy SoCal life -- beach, sun, people watching, diverse neighborhoods, and more!","Wanna enjoy SoCal life? Bring or rent a bike and ride (or skate or walk) the wide bike path from Pacific Palisades (Will Rogers State Beach) to Palos Verdes Peninsula. Serious cyclists and leisurely riders both enjoy riding next to the sand with a view to the west of the Pacific Ocean and to the east the various neighborhoods ... passing under the Santa Monica Pier, next to the colorful Venice Beach boardwalk, watch body builders work out at Muscle Beach, pass the Venice Pier, wind your way around the docks in Marina del Rey, check out volleyball in Manhattan Beach, pass the Manhattan Beach and Redondo Beach piers and check out the marine life in Palos Verdes.This is good for family, friends, couples, and solo adventurers. Go at your own pace. Just watch out for the serious cyclists riding fast ... especially between Redondo Beach and Venice.Take a break and people watch. There are many restaurants, cafes, coffee houses, juice shacks, benches, wide sandy beaches, green spaces, and other places to rest along the way.Some have travelled the path on fund-raising bar-rides (think bar-crawl, only on wheels). If you do, be certain to stay under the legal limit ... LA County Sheriffs do patrol the path (typically on bikes).",ConduitConsulting

10,Disappointed Customer Service,"I made a reservation for the bike tour in Santa Monica via Viator. Unfortunately on the same day of the tour I was ill and couldn't physically make the tour. The first thing I did was to cancel the trip from the Viator iPhone app, providing the reason and asking for a refund. I requested the cancellation 3 hours before the tour. At the time of the tour, Viator contacted me asking where i was (apparently the iPhone app doesn't work properly or they have a service a issue as they claimed never to have received notice). After explanation, they rebooked me for the following day. On the next day, I called the same person asking for the meeting point, and he told me their records showed I am cancelled. I explained that the only cancellation I sent was through the iPhone app (which I had already explained the prior day), before they rebooked me. At this point the Viator staff got unreasonably upset, and said things were too confusing and that they couldn't do business with me anymore or give me a refund. He also said"" you have a phone number why not you call us instead of cancelling via iPhone?"" well first of all, they made the iphone app. Secondly, if there is anything confusing, they also have my phone number! When I asked about the local guide's information to contact him directly, he told me ""couldn't engage at this point"" and ""had to decline me"". I can say that this was the WORST tourism customer experience I received in my whole life!Here is the summery that I think they can do better -A. Was not able to get refund when I feel sick, People could get sick when they travel, this is not something that is predictable"" with 48 hours' notice""!B. Their internal communication channel is terrible, what i sent from the iPhone app overwrites what has been discussed on the phone later and no one contacts me when there is a confusionC. Their customer service isn't professional at all",Elin W

40,Bike and Beer!,"I ride on the bike path every time I visit Santa Monica. It is a wonderful way to see the beach and watch people, especially in Venice Beach. The trail extends several miles north of the Santa Monica Pier to Will Rogers State Beach and Temescal Canyon Road. It extends south through Venice Beach to the Venice Pier. From there, the trail runs up Washington Boulevard and through a forest of sailboats docked in Marina del Rey, before crossing over Ballona Creek. It then becomes the South Bay Trail, which hugs the coast past LAX south to Redondo Beach.There are several bicycle rental places at both Santa Monica and Venice piers which charge $8-10/hour for rentals. Perry's (http://www.perryscafe.com/#/home/) has 9 locations to rent bikes and 4 open air cafes where you can grab breakfast or a snack. Perry's charges $10/hour for rentals.TIP #1: If you want serious exercise, you should plan to run/bike/rollerblade earlier in the day before the trail gets crowded in the mid-morning and afternoon. The trail is often congested at Windward Circle in Venice Beach.TIP #2: The trail is mostly flat, but riding north of the Santa Monica pier toward will take you slightly uphill and into a headwind for a less crowded workout.TIP #3: If you ride south toward Venice Beach, stop at On the Waterfront Cafe for their Happy Hour (6-8 pm). The people watching is great, you can often listen to street musicians perform, and for $3.50, a 1/2 liter of authentic German beer is both a good value and a nice reward after all that exercise!",Niborder
50,Nice family bike ride,"We hired bikes and rode from Santa Monica pier to Marina Del Ray with the children which is about 7 miles. 90% is on the bike path, the kids really enjoyed it. Great way to see Venice beach, the lovely beach properties plus all the quirky people ;)We rented our bikes from Santa Monica Bike Centre which is a block back from the beach front.Note: apply lots of sunscreen from head to toe on those warm windy days!",Vicky Mc

50,Totally Awesome!!,"We rented bikes at the Santa Monica pier and rode to Venice Beach. The day we went it was absolutely gorgeous. The temperature was about 78 to 80 degrees with a wonderful breeze coming off the ocean. The bike path is really great. It is flat which makes for a very relaxed enjoyable ride. I guess I was enjoying the ride so much, I really didn't notice that it was crowded. There are restaurants and bars along the way as well as numerous restrooms. If you have the opportunity while at the beach, I really recommend riding bikes, so worth it.",Kay S
50,best LA activity,"We spent a week in Los Angeles. The best activity we did was the bike path. Because we wanted to stop and see several things along the way we spent 2 days on the path. 1 day we went from Hermosa Beach about 1/2 way up the trail and back. Another day we started in Santa Monica and came 1/2 way down and back. This trail is absolutely beautiful. The beaches are terrific. We took our beach gear along and stopped whenever we were in the mood to relax and swim. There are several towns along the way with shops and restaurants. You can stay on the path, or venture off to explore these little towns. The views from the path great. If possible, try to do this on a weekday as the path gets very crowded on weekends. For us, we were in no hurry so the occasional crowded weekday stretches were no issue. For bike rentals I would recommend Hermosa Cyclery and Santa Monica Beach Bicycle Rentals.",HoneyBrookMhh
50,Super fun!,"So... I fell off my bike. Realllly fell off it. Hard. But that was because I was so busy gawping atthe gorgeous view rather than looking ahead at my husband who had stopped for pedestrians.But, even with grazed knees and elbows I carried on because riding along the 26mile path was great fun. Stopping at the basketball courts of Venice Beach and finding a quiet beach area near Malibu were highlights. We loved the people watching most of all.",lovelazysundays
50,Incredible fun!,"There are a number of places where you can hire bikes to do this ride but we chose the Bike Centre because it's situated close to the bus stop just off Ocean Ave up Colorado Ave. hire costs are reasonable: $20 for 1-2hours, which is ample for a trip down via Venice Beach to Marina del Rey and back, allowing for stops to sightsee and take photos along the way too. For those not from the USA, don't forget that GST is not inclusive and the tax is quite high in California. It's possible to take the bikes for longer and there is a 61-km round-trip you can do, but unless you're a serious cyclist you'll probably just want to stick to the beach track. It's an easy ride and interesting. Our advice is to take your time and enjoy the sights. There's plenty to see!",Kathy S
50,Great activity - might move too fast for small kids on weekends,"This is a very beautiful and fun way to see the coast. Some weekends in the summer can be quite busy and fast paced so I might not take a younger child on the path. There are people who use the path who are trying to get a workout and go quite fast - they will often yell at you if you are taking your time. Also be mindful when crossing the path because many people are using rented equipment and might not have great stopping abilities. If you want to see funky, go south of the pier towards Venice. If you want solitude and what I consider the better view, go north (towards Malibu) on the path. There are places to stop to eat going South but not many going North.",travelingworkingmom
40,A bit of a stretch,"Nice relaxing bike ride hired from Colorado Ave .. opposite the beach and bike trail. It was a very warm day, but we as a family of 4 hired 4 bikes...dont hire at beach, its cheaper on the street opposite. We went to the place next to mcdonalds and subway... you'll find it !!!! Lots of bikes outside. staff friendly enough.",JAG069
40,Very scenic...but busy,"One of the most scenic bike trails that I have been on. Ride along the beach and ocean. There are many rest rooms and restaurants along the way should you need. We only went from Santa Monica to Venice and back but very enjoyable. On a weekend, the bicycle traffic is quite heavy so you must stay alert!",Kelly W
40,Great except for the people,"We rented some bikes and rode down the Venice Beach part of the path. It was beautiful. Unfortunately, there were many people on the bike path despite the signs for ""bikes only"" and pedestrian sidewalks right next to it. There were quite a few times when we had to stop or really slow down to try to get through.",jennacole6
50,"Ocean Breezes, Hot Scenery",Great way to see Santa Monica and SoCal. Several bike rental operators nearby. Very popular trail w/lots of pretty people - including Hollywood celebrities.,Todd H
50,Totally fun!,"Best beach walk ever. Awesome people watching, great food options and fun shopping on the Venice stretch. Totally flat so easy bike riding. Also, has many fitness courses along the way.",Kirk R
50,Stunning,The path was amazing. While riding on the path you have a stunning view of the beach. On the other side of the beach was beautiful lush lawns.,Abba W
50,Nice way to see several different beach areas,"We rented our bikes at the East end of the Santa Monica Pier but there are rental places at many locations along the route. The bike path had a lot of pedestrians to avoid around the pier area but past that area was pretty much just cyclists. We made it south to Venice beach and walked the bikes past the little shops, stands, and performers. The path continues further South but weaves inland a bit and we lost the trail. North of Santa Monica Pier was even less people. Miles of beaches. Went up to the lifeguard headquarters and took pics of the Baywatch lifeguard boat. Would definitely do again. Use lots of sunscreen especially on the back of your hands. Do any turns and curves slowly, the sand makes them tricky.",Bruna F
40,Great for walking/running/biking,"Wonderful for evening walks can be busy in the morning. Obey the rules, the path is for everyone and outlined for everyone's pleasure.",notaholidayToronto
40,Brilliant Bike Path,"We hired our bikes from Sea Mist Rentals at the foot of Santa Monica Pier - we didn't make a booking however there was still plenty of bikes available to choose from. $18 will get you a bike for the whole day.A really great bike path to ride along with plenty to see along the way. There are several restuarant located just to the side of the path as you go. It is an easy flat ride to Venice Beach and likewise in the opposite direction. The bike path was very busy with cyclists, rollerbladers and walkers so careful as you go.",KiwiTraveller85
40,Pleasant way to spend a few hours,"We hired our bikes from Blazing Saddles on Santa Monica Pier ($10/hr), no booking required, you have to leave a deposit and sign a waiver. No easy access from the pier to the beach, so we ended up carrying our bikes down the stairs! Great path surface to cycle on, a lovely easy bike ride to Venice Beach passing Muscle Beach (unfortunately no major body builders working out for our visit), detoured up to the Canals area and back down to the beach bike path for our return to Santa Monica. If we'd had more time it would have been nice to discover other areas along the bike path. The beach is big so you are quite a way from the water. Get there early - we went on a Sunday and found parking right by the pier at about 10am but by the time we were leaving early afternoon, the traffic queues to park anywhere in the area were crazy!",rayman4
50,Excellent cycle path,Great way to exercise and see around the coast.Good variety of bikes available for hire. Be careful to take note where you hire the bike as a lot of the areas look the same when you decide to return your bike.,mushuBelfast
50,great place,"great place to bike, walk, jog or what have you.good place for pictures and just to enjoy the lovely southern california weather.",Curtez151
50,A significant highlight of the Beach experience!,"We rode this fabulous path from Redondo Beach to Santa Monica. There is much to see and do. Each beach community has a unique and special personality. Great shops, cafés, photo opportunities and bars along the way. The only comment is be aware of the high traffic during afternoons on the weekend! All good. All fun. Enjoy the ride. I will definitely be back......hopefully soon!",ckm444
40,Great way to see a stretch of the coast,"Have ridden a couple of times this summer from Temescal Canyon to Marina Del Rey. Yes, it's very crowded by the Santa Monica Pier and it's incredible the pedestrians who ignore the ""bikes only"" logos painted on the lanes...walking three abreast totally ignoring the oncoming bikes. So no, can't ride fast but you will still go through some beautiful sections of beach with plenty of opportunity to stop and rest under the palm trees or at one of the beach front cafes. Plenty of clean, well-maintained restrooms along the way. Very easy to stop to go off the path, explore Santa Monica, the Venice Canals, etc. You do leave the beach front once you get to the Venice/Marina Del Rey area and into street traffic but a few nice restaurants to be found up Washington Blvd. North of the SM Pier is much less crowded",jerjon
40,Great Way to Excercise and See Venice Beach,"There are bicycle rental locations all along this route, most only charging $5 an hour. You will see me on the bike path almost every day while I'm in Santa Monica! It's a great ride and it's fun looking at all the beautiful homes along the waterfront. My favorite destination is Venice Beach because of the fabulously freaky people and their unique art for sale. The only downside to heading this direction is the number of other bikers, skaters and meanderers also taking up space on the path. Heading north is more peaceful especially during high season. All in all though, a perfect way to spend an hour or two while you're there!",Karen G
40,Ride to See,"We rented bikes from the Bike Centre in Santa Monica with the intention of riding to Manahattan Beach and back. We good a little passed LAX before deciding tHat was enough.The ride (39kms) took us passed Santa Monica Pier, Venice Beach, Marina Del Rey and beyond.We managed to successfully get lost trying to cross over from Venice to the southern side of Marina Del Rey.Well worth doing.",AL9999q

50,Huge plus,"We were staying at the Fairmont hotel right across the water, and this Bike Path made for the perfect early morning ride we were looking forward to!The ride is flat and smooth, and best of all, safe.Perfect for walkers, runners, bikers, skateboarders, roller skaters, dog walkers, whatever you may be, this is the perfect spot.Great cultural ride, you get to see some great sights in Venice Beach, as well as the amazing view of the pier and the mountains of Malibu to the North.A MUST ride for all ages",Alex S
50,Must do,"Rented bikes at the Santa Monica Pier and rode to Venus Beach, then went into Venus for lunch. Rode back. What a great way to see the beach, enjoy the day get some exercise in.",justkayla
50,Hire a bike and trail the coastline,"We hired some bikes to go from Venice beach down to Santa Monica. I didnt realise the trail was 26 miles but even if you just hire a bike for an hour or two, it is definitely worth it to enjoy the different beaches and scenes along the way.",HSed22
50,Just Ride,"Easily my favorite thing to do whenever I'm in the area! We always start in Santa Monica and ride all the way down to Redondo. The ride is long but its relatively easy even for non-experienced bikers. It's mostly a coastal bike path the entire way with the exception of a small patch in Marina Del Rey. The ride is breathtaking with ocean views offered almost the entire way. Manhattan Beach is the perfect halfway spot to grab lunch and do a little shopping before turning back. I disagree with some comments about Venice Beach being dirty and seedy. Is it as breathtakingly beautiful as Manhattan Beach - no but it is perfectly safe and everyone there is harmless. The eccentric, quirky individuals ARE the beauty of Venice Beach and there's great people watching. This is truly one of the greatest ways to spend a day while in LA and take in so many beautiful beaches and scenery at once.",Martina N
50,"Beautiful, scenic & a very easy ride","We hired bikes from Blazing Saddles on the pier. No booking required. V easy ride to Venice Beach & Marina & then as far as possible the other way towards Malibu. Very smooth & flat and easy for kids and lots of places for drinks and eats stops. Venice area was a little bit scary though, lots of beggars & hawkers & not somewhere we would want to venture after dark.",FOXYSKI
50,People Watching,A great way to see a good amount of the coast we cycled from Santa Monica to Venice beach. Bikes are easy and reasonable to rent. A great way to get kids around without walking. Lovely long flat ride.,ZoeSparks
40,Awesome views,Venice beach area is not quite as clean as the Santa Monica toward Malibu area. The people watching is fantastic however!,Groves1960
40,Fun in the sun!,"My friend and I had a great time pedaling from Santa Monica to Marina del Ray. The sights in Venice Beach are great, and there's nothing like having the ocean and palm trees on one side of you, and shops and restaurants on the other. The ocean path stops at the southern end of Venice, but there are bike paths that will connect you to the next ocean bike path. Do follow them, otherwise you'll end up on busy streets without paths. I speak from experience! We missed the path on the way to Marina del Ray but found it on the way back.This is a great way to sneak in some exercise, have fun and sightsee all at the same time! Enjoy!",rmak2009
50,Fabulous bike ride,"This is awesome. You can just jeep riding on this flat safe and sunny bike way. Full of sights and interesting people along the way that keep you intrigued.We rode parts if this almost every day we were I n Santa monica.Take your bike chain and lock si you can still at markets , food stalls and buskers along the way",nursenancy2013
50,Great day time acitivity,"On a warm day is the perfect way to get exercise and sun! Tip- On a cold day wear a long sleeve shirt, the breeze from the ocean makes the trip a uncomfortable.",claribelTeran
40,Walk in the sun,"Nice path to bike, skate , or take a walk. We walked down from town along the beach in the am and then grabbed a nice breakfast at "" Back on the Beach"" cafe, great omelettes, and then walked back to town and checked out the market. Great place for a long walk and getting a tan. We like the am before the sun gets too hot.",dinerdon
50,"Sea breeze, sun, safe - the best bike path!","Along the beach with plenty of sea breeze, sunshine and safe from cars- it is a real enjoyment to bike on this path. Do need to be watchful as there are many people and groups are also enjoying the bike path as if there are no bikes at all.",Victor H
50,Nice way to spend a day,"Given the number of people out there on any given day this bike path works great. Great views all along the way and separated from pedestrians most of the way. Don't expect to be setting any speed records and be prepared for some erratic riding, but other than that it's a great experience. Bring along a lock and stop along the way for a meal or snack or some shopping. You can rent bikes at many places along the path or bring your own.",Steve W
40,Loved this bike trail,"We enjoyed riding this very flat and well marked bike trail. For two people who are in decent shape, a few miles on this path should be no problem and a no-brainer. The paths offer beautiful scenery!",Daniel A

50,A fun day for the family,"We were a large group of 3 families with kids aged from early teen down to 5 years old. We hired bikes from the just under the pier at Santa Monica - excellent service- great price! We had proper grown up bikes, tandems and tag alongs. Great afternoon bike ride from Santa Monica to Venice beach, the bikes come with locks so we could confidently secure them to walk the famous Venice Beach and grab some lunch. Our youngest independant rider was 7 and he had no problems. It was the weekend so foot traffic was a little hectic in places - but most of the way is dedicated bike tracks with respectful other users. If in LA this is a must do - a fantastic way of catching a glimpse of Californian beach life and the characters of Venice Beach - whilst congratulating yourself on partaking in some (minimal) exercise!",Jude D D
10,Wonderful day out,"Make sure you hire a bike , we had trikes which were really good and had a fun family day out , make sure you use extra sun tan lotion as we had a couple of burnt places ,",Clairesb261
40,Great bike route,"Hired bikes on the beach front rode down to the marina, great day out and a nice and easy ride. Busy in places so be on your guard for other beach users, great to do on a weekend.",UKRichiesb
40,Great path,"When in Santa Monica, I run each morning from Santa Monica to the Venice Pier. The run is about 7-8 miles and the views are breathtaking. There are some homeless people near the Venice Pier, though I have never been approached or seen anyone approached. Seems safe.",jimmerhand
50,Great social ride.,"On a good day the path is very crowded. It's a social ride not a race track. this is not the place to get your training for the next triathlon. Plenty of walkers, skaters etc, and tourists doing their thing. Around Venice beach the path features some roadside stalls hawking their wares.",Laurie B
50,You see L.A. from the Bike path,"Among the great bike paths in the world, the bike path starts in Santa Monica and ends in Torrance/Palos Verdes. At every interval there is a new slice of L.A. life. At the northern Santa Monica end you find Westside sophisticates. As you peddle south toward Venice, families flock to the famous SM pier and Muscle Beach playgrounds. At Venice's crowded boardwalk, hipsters and tourists mingle among henna and art stalls. At the path's heart, Venice Beach, a grand cacophony of humanity mix; it's worth a break to just walk around and take it all in. At Washington Blvd., you round Marina del Rey by traveling inland for a bit, but soon you're cycling to the beachfront again and viewing rich people sail their yachts in and out of port. Near LAX, the beach goers are more ethnically mixed and finally the southern section of the path hits South Bay chic with the well healed communities of Manhattan Beach and Hermosa Beach. You get all this for a simple bike rental from any of dozens of shops along the path.",Frank M
50,Avoid mid-day during the busy Summer months. Excellent adventure!,"Many nearby bike and skate rental shops in the Venice Beach area. Rent a bike or skates and join the conga line!From Venice BEach, you can travel north past the Santa Monica Pier, all the way to Will Rogers State Beach. Or, you can head south, passing Marina Del Rey, Playe Del Rey, Manhattan Beach, and Redondo Beach. The south-bound route involves a few sections mixed with cars. The northbound is entirely on the sand (car-free, except for Segways and Golf carts driven by city workers).The Venice Beach to Santa Monica Pier section has many sidewalk cafes, street performers, restrooms, and retail stores, and Venice Beach Skateboard Park is a must-see.Pedestrians are supposed to walk on the boardwalk, but they disregard the ""Bikes Only"" signage, and parade on the bike path - do try to avoid running into these folks. Summer weather brings large crowds to the bike path, if you seek solitude arrive before 10am or after 4pm during hot weather.",HappySurfer
30,"Beware of pedestrians, jiggers, and roller bladers",The famous bike path is not designed for an exercise regimen. If you have a beach bike with fat tires so you don't slide in the sand that often covers the path and that allows you to slalom around the non-bikers at perhaps 5 mph - then it can be fun. If you ride for exercise and at speed ... It's dangerous...,Curmudgeon7
50,Great fun!,"This is a paved bike path that runs all the way from south of Venice to Will Rogers state park. It's a wonderful way to relax and see the area. You can easily spend a full day riding up and down the bike path and stopping in various locations. There are some cafes right on the sand if you want to stop for refreshments, or in Venice, many restaurants are just several hundred feet away on the boardwalk. Also many public restrooms along the way. It got pretty busy, even in mid-May so I would imagine it's mobbed in the summer months. Early AM is a nice time to ride if you prefer solitude.",DE_Traveler_2012
50,"Great trail, but watch out for pedestrians","This is a great trail for a nice bike ride and to enjoy the beaches. They keep it clean, but the only hazard are those individuals who walk in the middle of the path, take up the whole path or just aren't paying attention to their kids. It's a great ride, with places to stop along the way if you want.",EB808
50,A Taste of LA,Bring your bikes and start pedaling. Plan a full day to see everything. To much to see and do. Fun place to really get a taste of the LA beach scene. Lots of places to eat and bring a camera or even a video recorder.,4PawFolks
50,Gotta Do this!!!!,"We rented bikes on the pier at Santa Monica and rode south until the path ran out. It was great. We made stops at Venice Beach and Muscle Beach. Easy, flat bike path. Not strenuous at all.Must watch out for clueless pedestrians though. We ran out of time to ride North of the pier.",soccermom1973

50,Always bike Santa Monica,"Every year we visit LA, rent bikes and head off to Venice Beach in one direction and toward Malibu on the other. Great riding - exercise, ocean air and fun to people watch or stop and gaze.",karlowsj
50,Great place to work out or take a stroll.,"I have used this bike path for working out or taking a stroll prob over a 100 times over the last couple of years while I have been living in St Monica. Its like having a private threadmill with sun and a beautifull view and an amazing sunset! Try going just before sunset, or early in the morning on a sunny day. Some of the bikers are very annoying though, lots of them can not make a proper turn on a bike, others are maniacs doing their panic weekend workout at full speed, so watch out;-) Some families will think they own the whole path and some annoying runners like myself will just run straight ahead and expect everone to get out of their way, haha....beautifull place though, especially in the winter when its less crowded.",Vindens
50,great site seeing,"If you like to bike ride this is a great way to see a small part of the coast of Cali. The path is well done, some hills but not treacherous.",68KarinC4

50,The most beautiful bike ride anywhere!,"I may be biased. Full disclosure: I live in Santa Monica and I bike everywhere. The beach bike path is my all time favorite ride. My husband and I often like to ride from Santa Monica down to Redondo Beach with a stop at Naja's--great chicken wings + tater tots + 70+ beers on tap. Back in Santa Monica, stop at Big Dean's or the SM Pier. If you need a bike, Perry's Bike Rentals and the SM Bike Center are both handy places to rent a bike and start pedaling. SM Bike Center is at SM Place Mall (corner of 2nd St + Colorado Ave). Perry's has 3 locations directly on the SM beach bike path. Enjoy. And if you really want to feel like a local, grab a Godmother sandwich at Bay Cities Deli (Lincoln Blvd @ Broadway) and enjoy on the beach!",88jet88
40,on a roll,"flat, scenic and crowded. this is an easy bike ride, but on weekends, be prepared for heavy bike, stroller and jogger traffic. it's a great way to see the beach front, check out the homes along the beach, be sure to bring a bike lock and either eat at one of the restaurants or bring a picnic and eat at the beach.",Terri S
50,Wish I lived here,"Stayed at Fairmont across the street from the path. Used it often, to walk to Pier, run and take walks. Very safe, wide path, room for runners, walkers, skaters & bikers.

50,Just like the movies,"As an Australian that lives on the coast, I have to say, I wish we had something like this!

Gave strict details on how to ride the bike, safety issues, etc. Very pleasant owner. Bikes were great and the ride is amazing.

A lot of bike rentals in the area want $50 or $100 deposit, this one only requires one person""s drivers license. The path is more lined with shops and the skateboard park going towards Venice Beach but path ends at the end of Venice Beach and be careful because once it ends if you continue on the pedestrian walk you can get a ticket from the police as well as having locals yell at you asking if you can read the signs. We honestly didn't see the sign saying no bikes beyond this point. Going towards Malibu is more quiet and scenic views of the mountains.

I generally do not ride on the weekend since it is very crowded. The bike paths are kept clean of sand and are marked well. They start to wind the closer you get to the Venice Boardwalk, which is ok since it allows for some interesting people watching. If one is tired you can get off the bike and stroll on the boardwalk and enjoy it's funkiness. If you want a bit of a different experience you can cut across Washington Blvd and hook up with the trail that is still along the beach- but behind the airport. Very cool to ride with huge airplanes overhead. TAKE WATER on a hot day.Enjoy !",Nili99

During the weekend, the you might have to walk your bike through Hermosa Beach and the path through Venice beach gets quite hectic but there are several stretches that you will be almost solo, even on the weekend. Most of the path from Playa Del Rey and South is underutilized and perfect for a higher speed ride. The path is kept incredibly clean and clear of sand and debris, the only place I have encountered dangerous sand in the turns was in Venice. If you like biking, this is a great easy ride.",PilotMichael_L
50,A beautiful bike ride,"I love this place. One Of my favorite things to do everytime I go to LA. If you are in LA, you should try It!",xivi09
50,One of my favorite things to do in LA!,"Ever since I started coming here in the 1980s it is one of my favorite things to do in LA. Grab a bike and head north or south from where you are, slowly watching the beach scene as you ride by. From Santa Monica to Venice and back is particularly colorful and memorable.",BandonBeachlover
50,Great cycle,This was a great cycle way but bikes we hired were a bit doggy.Would recommend you get your bike from Blazing Saddles in 2nd Street behind the Shore hotel. The ones on the beach front are a bit of tourist rip off.,Karen D
50,"Great ride, fun in the sun!","As we live in the area we have done all or parts of this bike ride many, many times. If you start from the far western end, you actually can park in the Temescal Canyon parking lot, go all the way to the west end of the lot and you will be at the end of the trail. Starting from here you will go south-east past or under the Santa Monica Pier and on through Venice Beach. If it's a weekend or very busy, stay on the bike path and snake around the Venice area. If not busy you can stay on the Venice Boardwalk for a couple of miles, connecting back up with the bike path later. You are now heading towards Marina del Rey. You will come up on Washington Blvd., where the bike path takes a jog onto city streets. You will need to go east on Washington Blvd. about two miles, where you have to watch for a bike path entrance on the right that will reconnect you with the bike path. Follow the bike path through MDR. If you start to feel like you are lost, stop and watch other cyclists and you can most likely follow their lead through the tricky parts of the Marina. Once through the marina, you will once again empty onto a street, bear right and follow the road about two miles to a culdesac, the bike path starts again and you are good to go. This part of the path will take you past many if the beach cities, Playa del Rey, El Segundo, Manhattan Beach and onto Redondo Beach, where the path winds under the pier. Great place to stop for food. Continue on the path past the pier and the bike path ends at the foot of Palos Verdes Peninsula. From the end of Temescal to this point you have gone 23 miles. Now you can turn around and head back via the same route. You can vary the trip by shortening the route or going into any of the beach towns along the way. Have fun!",ZumaDawg
40,spent the day cycling the path,"Had a great time cycling from Santa Monica pier to Hermosa PierAfter Venice beach, you have to go inland to go around the Marina, and a few miles on, there is a power station, which is quite ugly, but worth continuing to reach hermosa Pier, a few nice bars and cafe's here, perfect for lunch before turning around.There are many otehr nice places to stop during the cycleworth at least 1/2 a day",Ascot_Flyer
40,#1 Ride Venice to Santa Monica and beyond,"If you go to Venice you can not miss doing this. Flat ride that is not so easy if you do not pay attention to the fact you are riding and get distracted by all the people watching. Lots of bike rentals and if you never ridden a cruiser then give it a try. Lots of stops along the way for bathroom breaks, shopping and people watching",Judi K
40,"Scenic, But Keep Your Eyes On The Road","The scenery is great, but remember there are fellow riders who may not have been on a bicycle for years. There are plenty of reasonably clean toilets along the way, a very welcome feature for men over age 50. However, the city/county/whatever needs to do a better job of keeping sand off of the pavement. If a small kid, a wino, or a druggie were to wander into your path, the sudden stop could get real exciting real quickly if you found yourself hitting the brakes and trying to turn while in a couple of inches of sand.",Grundoon
50,South Bay Bike Path is Fantastic,"If you want to see a lot of people and experience Venice Beach kookiness Take the path south from Santa Monica to Venice on a weekend.Super crowded. If you wan to experience more of a Southern Ca. beach scene pick up the path further south in Marina Del Rey or Playa del Rey and ride south down to Manhattan Beach, Hermosa, Redondo Beach and Torrance beach ending up at the foot of Palos Verdes. You can enter the bike path at any of these places. You will see plenty of beach dwelling locals, people playing volleyball, sparkling water, and beautiful homes on the strand. Hermosa has plenty of cute cafes and places to stop for a bite just off the path.If you wan to beat the crowds then avoid weekend afternoons but then the weekends are fun people watching days. This is great for the whole family and really is the only way to really experience the LA beach scene. Each beach town has their own personality. I liove her and I LOVE this bike path.",lqgueradg35
50,Nice Ride,"Rented bikes by the Santa Monica pier and rode for 4 hours for $22. Only way to see the beaches and sights along Santa Monica, Venice and Marina del Rey. Don't expect to have a bike race, lots of people out for a sunday ride and out to see the sights and watch the characters. A nice surprise to find a Cheesecake Factory on the water in Marina del Rey for lunch. Easy ride and very enjoyable",Kram0523
50,"Great experience, easy ride","Easy to rent bikes, ride north toward the mountains, south toward venice beach. The path is flat and not that crowded (in October).",vacationlover061
20,Very disappointing,"We do a lot of cycling at home, so top on our list for Santa Monica was the 26 mile bike path, especially to burn off all the calories consumed during our trip.It was a major disappointment, Venice beach were rough and full of homeless bums. The path was mega busy with walkers, joggers, rollerbladers and other cyclists so quite treacherous. The worse bit was when the beach path stopped, and went onto rad for a while - it wasn't well signposted and we ended up cycling along a crazy dual lane road dodging roadworks in attempt to find path again.And there really isn't much to see other than beach and sea, although I suppose the is expected on a beach path!",dawny_mc
50,So easy to ride you won't feel,like it's a work out or that you really biked 26 miles! Really not that bad of a price either. $30 for two hours!,courtneymccollum
50,best bike ride ever!!,Best bike ride ive ever taken - you must do it if in the area! Venice beach is worth checking out and a short ride away.,GailC78
40,Beautiful way to clear jet lag,Luckily I found myself with a couple of hours to spare and the need to get over some jet lag. The bike hire was cheap and there are lots of places to hire. Also lots of water fountains and toilets along the route. The views of the beach and ocean are terrific but I particularly enjoyed looking at how the beach front property changed as I went along the route. One small hint - if there is a wind the day you do it remember that it will slow you down when you have to cycle into it.,GDM70
50,Great time biking!,"We rented beach cruisers and rode this trail from Santa Monica to Hermosa Beach. Had lunch and returned. Very fun! Lots of volleyball players, surfers, bikers and runners to check out along the way. Great way to enjoy the California coast!",MTBTrails
50,Great way to journey in the South Bay,Imagine billing or running from Santa Monica to Redondo Beach with the Pacific Ocean in sight nearly the whole way. There are very few hills and it is a wonderful way to spend a day.,Cavydad
50,Easy and fun beach ride,Stayed on the beach path and did not venture into the streets. This was still about 14 miles total. Weekends are definately crowded. Weekday mornings were great. Lots to see. Plenty of pit stops though not much for food.,jegnm
40,great fun,"This was a great way to see Santa Monica, hired bikes for the day and went up and down santa monica, muscle beach etc, plenty of little bars and restaurants on the cycle path to stop and have a drink and rest.",davesbirdDublin
50,A great free thing to do in Santa Monica,"A great bike path along the beach. I recommend to do the trail not on a weekend for a more peaceful experience. Plenty of places to stop for the bathroom and use the water fountain. Coffee/lunch stops are more limited and for good places I would recommend to plan stops off the trail, eg go up to M Street Kitchen or the cafes on Main Street.",UKFemaleTraveller
50,"Really nice, comfortable way to see the beach life","It is very nice on a summer day to cruise down with a chopper bike. Bring sunglasses and sunscreen. For us it became a very romantic day out, stopping a long the way to just feel the wibe. Venice beach is one of the highlights.",Hal T
40,Great way to see the area,"This bike path goes for miles. You will find bike rentals everywhere. Just be careful of the walkers as they walk in the bike path, even though they have their own trail. What a great way to spend a day.",vacationlady1
40,Great - until it goes off the beach and onto the backstreets,"Pretty good beach views along the way. And it is fabulous you can go for miles without having to negotiate cars. That said, there is a part after Venice when you have to divert and go onto the backstreets for 10 minutes. Pedestrians are a bit of a hazard too as they walk on the bike path even though they have their own paths. But it is definitely worth hiring bikes and doing the ride despite this. No doubt about it.",London_Travellers_09
40,Fresh and fun,"Seems a paradox to ride along the wide open beaches of LA, stopping every now again for a latte ( no decaf cappucino !). We rode south and you do need to keep your eyes open - no one wears a helmet and everyone seems to drift around a lot. If you are going south you need to cut in at the marina, which means some time on the road ( some crazy drivers and bends ) but ok overall ( make sure you look in the right direction if you are an Aussie or a Brit ). Bikes are available generally for around $7 an hour or $18 a day ( you can probably do better if you look around or get a hotel bike ).All I wanna do ... !",Shaun M
50,Best ever,Located on the wonderful beach it long & spectacular along side the oceanBest to take a ride at sunset to enjoy the beauty of colors & lightu can rent a bike or skates & Have a lot of funIt makes Santa Monica one of the most plesant locations on the planet sport & nature & the ocean,Mariacristina Heller
50,Bike Rental,"We rented bikes for half price, found a Groupon for it! Rode from Venice to Malibu! Very easy ride and lots of things to see along the way. Not difficult at all!",myway2fly
50,Bike and watch,"The stretch is great,the babes beautiful,the ocean superb,the climate perfect!People are vey friendly and there are lots of characters playing,doing sport,surfing,playing in the beach and most girls are simply stunning.Some of the bike rental bikes are junk so choose carefully.",CFNordstrom
50,So much fun!,"We rented bikes and just followed the trail to one side, stopped at the end of it, sat in the sand and had a lovely splash in the sea. Got back on the bike, rode back to the pier and further on to Venice beach. We had a great time! It's so relaxing to feel the wind, the sand, the sun...there's so much to see: cute houses, weird stores, even weirder people (although there are also lots of normal folks). There are a zillion things going on, yet nothing happens. If you're visiting LA -certainly with teenagers- this is one thing you must do!",ClaudioQM
50,what an interesting and great bike ride,this is a really cool place to bike...especially if you go by venice beach...i would highly recommend,rsaluck
50,Should be on a travelers bucket list!,"I've done this twice while in Santa Monica on vacation and it is always a highlight. Wonderful views, people watching and sun.Everyone should do this at least once. Plan on an hour or more and beach cruiser bikes are better than mountain bikes.We saw people with electric bikes which is just plain silly. :)",justthefacts41
40,Loved that there is a dedicated path for bikes,"our family rode from santa monica, to venice beach to marina del rey...we loved the scenery, we loved the beach and it was a great way to spend the afternoon. the path is free to ride on, but you must have a bike or rent one. plenty of places around the piers to do that.",masin70
50,Local Feel,"If a visitor wants to get a real taste of life in Santa Monica, take a trip on our bike path. You can walk it or rent a bike and ride it....equally enjoyable either way. I walk a stretch of it every morning with my dog, and I believe this is what addicted me to life at what we locals call ""the beach"". In New Jersey we called it ""the shore"". Not sure if it's the smells, the sounds, or the sights that makes me want to be there as much as possible...probably all three. As a visitor, it's how I'd begin my mornings.",Rich J
50,Run or cycle or walk near ocean and sand,"A lot of Santa Monica and Venice are about the beach, and the best way to see it is on wheels. Well kept route, and people seem to follow good community standards to make for safe travel",Mike_J1963
40,A great way to feel like a local resident!,"We hired bikes at the first place we saw which was a bit of a mistake, as although the adult bikes we rented were fine, the child bike was old and we weren't advised at the time to hire a child's helmet. We felt the child's helmet was really necessary as some of the bike path after Venice Beach continued along Washington Road which was busy. Unfortunately, without a child's bike helmet we didn't feel it was safe to venture any further than the beach path which stopped past Venice Beach at Washington Road. We really enjoyed the 4 mile return journey we took, but we would have liked to have gone further, as it was a great way to get a feel for the local area.There are plenty of Bike hire shops along the Beach and in Santa Monica/ Venice Beach varying in price, but mostly I would suggest looking at the quality of the bikes on offer.Hiring bikes on a weekday would be preferable as the bike path is less busy.",jzeee
50,Unexpected Fun,"One of the best memories from our trip to Santa Monica. Do not miss on that experience. I did not expect it to be so much fun and such a nice way to enjoy the view of the ocean, the beach, and people. Great path from Santa Monica pier to Venice beach.",BurArTu
50,Brilliant - and I can barely cycle!,"We didn't cycle far, just Santa Monica to Venice Beach but it was terrific fun and our cycle hire man was very patient as I practised a bit to build up my cycling courage.Do try and go in the morning, less busy and cool. Would have liked to cycled longer if we'd had time. A great way to experience LA.",AJS33N1
50,Amazing,We rented bikes from one of the beach stalls. Flat and easy for all the family with plenty of play areas for the little one on the way.,Ceirion P
50,Wow!,"We actually didn't stay in Santa Monica long enough to rent bikes, but I wish we had. The trail ON the beach is simply amazing.",StaceyLeeDee
50,Wonderful experience,"Nobody told us, but Santa Monica Beach tends to be foggy in the summer mornings. What a great time to rent a bike and ride the 26- Mile Bike Path! We stayed at Shutters so they set us up with the bikes. You can definitely rent them from any point for less money. I think $18 is the standard day rate. We rode along the very flat bike path with our daughters and all felt comfortable even though it got crowded by late morning. It was fun passing through Venice Beach and Muscle Beach. A must do when in Santa Monica Beach.",Jennifer L
50,Great fun,Took the teenagers and went for about 5 hours - did not do the whole thing but it was a great way of seeing some of the coast line.,SurreyTravel_Bug
50,So cool !,"We rented bikes at Sea Mist Bike Rental (just at Santa Monica Pier) - great service and fun to do ! No extras for adding a carrier so we could carry water and bathing suits and so on, go from Santa Monica to Venice beaches, and more.",Robert L
50,Bike path is great for walkers too,We walked from Santa Monica to Venice Beach on the path -- walking path runs parallel to the bike path. It is very pleasant to walk along the beach - lots of other walkers - many with dogs (this is a very dog-friendly part of the country.) Walk from Santa Monica to Venice is about 2 miles each way -- not at all strenuous - nice and flat along the beautiful wide beach.,E K
40,A lovely way to spend a day!,"$18 dollars to hire a bike for the day was amazing value! We cycled a total of 25 miles on this very flat and easy path. Some parts are very busy, other parts are much better. Look out for the 'Fishermans Village' area as you go around the huge marina - we spent a very pleasant 20 minutes there watching all the seals!",LCBen
50,Great place to stretch your legs!,"If you are a sport person, you will love the sunrise while a nice running on the path...and if not, a nice walk would be also a worthwhile experience",ktycastillo
50,Wonderful,"This was fun, we rode to Venice Beach and had lunch. A nice easy ride. I would do this again if I return.",krsnVirginia
50,Awesome ride!,Liked everything about this easy ride with beautiful scenery. Must try! Disliked nothing about it. Stopped at a restaurant called FigTree cafe in Venice beach which was amazing! Must try this place. Favorite restaurant of the trip.,Zachary S
50,A day of fun and exercise too!,"Do it! Rent a bike, ride from Santa Monica to Palos Verdes and enjoy. In the summer months you'll want to go early as the winds pick up around 10:00am.Have breakfast at the Terrace cafe on Washington at the Venice Pier or Mexican anywhere. I like El Tarasco but the Baja Cantina has great atmosphere and you can take a quick trip around the Venice Canals. Then make your way down to Old Tony's over the water in Redondo beach for sunset cocktails before that long ride back to SM/Venice or hop on a bus with bike racks!",Ron K
40,"Beautiful view, good ride","How many places have a bike path right on the ocean? Amazing view and almost never hot. It is crowded on weekends so don't be a jerk and yell at the tourists for walking on the bike path, but during the week, especially early morning or late afternoon, you can crank it up and go fast- especially south of the marina",hikingdude
50,fun-excercise,"Enjoy a whole day on the bike path. Stop for snacks and drinks along the way, or go for a dip in the ocean when it gets too hot. It’s beautiful, and you won’t realize you’ve been biking for hours.",negin T
50,One of my favorite things,The bike path is my favorite part of Santa Monica. I ride my bike there a couple of times each week. There are restaurants to stop in if you get hungry (Shutters on the beach is a nice choice). It's a great way to spend a day in Santa Monica,RebeccaED
50,Best thing about the beach!,"Unless it is pouring rain, this should be your first stop on a vacation to Santa Monica. You can rent bikes in many places along the 26 mile path, stop for food, drinks or shopping in the towns (Santa Monica, Venice, Marina Del Rey, Playa Del Rey, Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach & Redondo Beach), or just enjoy a short walk from Venice Beach to the Santa Monica Pier. The entire path from Pacific Palisades to Redondo Beach is gorgeous, and is a fairly easy 3 hour bike ride, one way. If you are exhausted once you get there, the city buses will let you pop your bike onto the front of the bus and ride back to your car/hotel.",Suziselt
50,Excellent!,"Whether you're walking, cycling or roller blading, this path is a must see/do! Right on the beach, beautiful view of the sea and not so crowded on some days (like if its a cool weekday, it's not as crowded).",livinglifefun
50,Best way to see the area!,We only rode bout 5 miles of the trail because we kept stopping. But absolutely worth doing. We rented bikes right by the pier and peddled toward Venice beach. Greg way to spend the day though. Lots to see and a fun and easy ride. Can get a bit crowded.,GMM2301
50,A MUST DO,"Hire a bike and head off, this is an excellent way to spend the day - one of my favourite things we did while in the US.",Number9NZ
40,Cool but crowded...,"Don't try to do your intense 6 or 10 mile run on a Saturday afternoon on the Path. Major pedestrian traffic, roller bladers, walkers, bikers, tandem bikers, unicyclists, and more.... just get your workout done either super early in the morning or on your hotel treadmill.... then go on the Bike Path and enjoy a lazy beach cruiser bike ride or saunter down the path and do some people watching. Great place, lots of fun... but too crowded for a meaningful workout...just saying...",Travelr101
40,Worth trying out even just a small section,"We hired bikes and IDE from Santa Monica to Matin Del Ray, probably only 2/3 miles in goal but it was a great way to see a bit more than you could walking. If you staying in Santa Monica get bikes from the little place Sea Mist at $7 per hour and try it out",ian w
50,People and Coast-Watching Galore,The bike path is well worth the 2 hour rental. The rental rates we saw were $7 per hour. I really recommend taking the time to bike from Santa Monica all the way down to Venice and even beyond if you like. Realize that once you hit Washington Blvd in Venice the path disappears. We were hoping to travel further south you have to wind through the city once you reach the pier. We rode a few blocks with our 8 year old but we wanted to be on the coast enjoying the view.,jrhinomo
50,How could this be bad?,"It is a flat, paved path along the beach...for 26 miles! A runner's dream. Nice to be able to run along the coast without worrying about getting run over by an inattentive motorist.",Chris N
50,Awesome way to spend a day,Rent your bike and take the ride. It'll be worth every drop of sweat. Not only will you get some much needed calorie burn the sightseeing is phenomenal. Riding down to Muscle Beach will always make you feel better about how you got there.,superticomonkeyboy
50,Fun Easy Ride!,"This is a must if you enjoy riding a bicycle! There are lots of public restrooms along the way and numerous places for snacks / drinks / lunch. One of our favorite restaurants to eat at is the Sidewalk Café cause the food is good and you can people-watch too!There a lot of places to rent a bicycle, so no worries if you don't have your own!",travelgal1969
50,Nice ride from Pacific Palisades to Torrance Beach,"Great workout, nice ride takes you through all the South Bay cities as well. Lots of people watching. Look out if you start from north to south, the afternoon return can seem like a tough uphill ride in the afternoon wind.",AARDVARKKILLER
50,Top riding spot,"We have biked some wonderful locations in the US, but this ranks right up with the best. Nice easy ride on rental bikes and many places to use facilites along the ride. We found a cute little sandwich shop right on the tpath and the views of the Pacific Ocean can't be beaten. Don't worry about a bike there are many rental shops right along the bike path..",Karen B
50,Got to bike it,"I reckon it would take forever to walk the distance we covered on the bike today... Rent early as its not so busy and take your time taking in all of the sights along the beach..

50,Great Ride!,"The beach bike path was a lot of fun, there is a lot of foot traffic in areas but overall it is much safer than the roads.

The view is great and it runs all the way from Malibu to the Marina.",Phil S
50,Great way to get some exercise and see some sights,My daughter and I rode from the Santa Monica Pier past Venice Beach and it was a wonderful time. The path seemed to be well maintained.

There were plenty of bathroom stops and water fountains spread along the way.,Melanie M

50,Enjoyable afternoon journey!,"Rent bikes close to but not on the pier and head in either direction for a casual and easy bike ride on one of the most scenic trails I have ever been on. Ride past Palicades Park to the foothills, or head in the other direction to Venice Beach. The trail is wide and easy to ride and there is always some random and unusual sights to see (it is California, after all)!",Lorraine B
50,Beautiful bike path,"Save money by renting from a spot right next to the pier. If you rent on the pier, plan on paying $30 for a daily rental beach cruiser. Head south of the pier just below and pay $18 for a daily rental. Watch out for pedestrians who will cut you off. Otherwise it's a beautiful ride.",MullerFamily826

50,Best part of the trip to LA,"Got to the bike rental shop at 9am on Sunday and rented bikes and a trailer for two adults, two teenagers, and a five year old. We all had so much fun. So many places to stop, Santa Monica Pier, playgrounds, skate park, shopping, places to eat, and of course the beach! Rode until 7pm. You do have to watch where you are going of course because there are people and children everywhere and you have to walk across the bike path to get to the beach. There are also serious bike riders speeding along we definitely ""stayed to the right"".",Tasha G
50,"Lots of interesting pockets of community along the way, not to mention the Pacific Ocean all the way on one side!",The number of homeless folks camped out was disturbing...the uniqueness of each home located beachside was beautiful as well as all the activites offered by the beach .,KatBry
50,A must do activity,"Rode from Malibu to Marina Del Ray and had such a great time. Lots of beach cafés for breaks, many clean washrooms along the path and they even provide locks so you can top and visit areas of interest such as the World famous Santa Monica Pier, Venice Beach... We rented bikes for the day ($18.00 payable at the end) per person with a ($20.00) deposit for the lock. Cash only and you must leave a photo ID. This was one of the highlight of my trip",Chantal D
20,don't use on weekends,"This path is a free for all. BIkers, stollers, joggers, walkers, homeless, tourists, all trying to use this path. You see an officer every so often but they are here to make sure no one threatens each other. Either just make it for leisurely walks or bikes, do not keep it as , it is very dangerous. Near misses are very common, I would be very interested how many people get hurt here, either run over by a bike or a rental bike from the concession stands. Best advise? Stay away from using on weekends. This is very typical of the LA scene. Everyone wants something but no one takes any responsiblity for their own actions.",Frank G
50,Best way to see the beach,"We rented bikes at a place we came across that was in between the Third Street Promenade and the Santa Monica Pier. Bike rental cost us $25 each for a 4 hour rental. We were able to cover so much ground on the bikes, far more than we would have on foot. The beach is beautiful, of course. We biked along Santa Monica Beach and Venice Beach. I would totally recommend renting bikes for this journey.",Regina M
50,Biking Around...,"Wither your looking to bike for leisure or exercise this is the perfect place. The views of the pacific are awesome and the surrounding areas are great to see as well. Feel free to pace yourself and soak up some rays or put your pedal to the metal for a great sweat. There are several places along the route to rent bikes (tandem, single (with wagon for children). If you want to stop along the way be sure to ask your rental facility for a lock to secure the bike and feel free to take a respite on the beach. All in all this is a great way to spend the day.",Vicente C
50,Fun day at the beach,"What a great way to spend a day at the beach. We rented two bikes in the morning and spent all day on this path. You get to see the whole area, stop where you want, see what you want to see and eat and drink where you want to do it.Along the way you are entrained by all kind of people and activities. Much better than finding a spot on the beach and stay there.Get some exercise and enjoy Santa Monica.",Cuso1960
50,A Wonderful Experience!,"We rented Beach cruiser bikes for $15 dollars a piece and rode them for nearly 4 hours along the ocean. It was such a wonderful, enjoyable, (& easy!) ride along the designated bike path. The ocean was on one side, and the pedestrian boardwalk on the other side. It was safe--away from cars. It was the highlight of our trip! I would like to highly recommend this activity if you get the chance. I can't wait to go back and do this again.",KristinCeleste
50,very nice!,"went for a walk on this 26-mile path with my fiance - it was a really really beautiful, romantic experience! What a view!",Sohaib M
40,Great bike path for touring,"Though I didn't get to explore the entire bike trail, the short rides between Santa Monica and Muscle Beach were worth the price of bike rentals. The path is well defined, and curves past skate boarding parks, cafes, and outdoor play structures.Very fun, like riding past an on-going carnival! I imagine it is worth exploring the entire 26 miles, something I will do if I am ever back in the area.",aprilstein
50,Fantastic!,We rode from Will Rogers State park ( North of Santa Monica Pier) to Manhattan beach and thoroughly enjoyed every mile! Its coastline all the way with the exception of a few blocks on the road after Venice Pier but even then there is a marked bike lane. The route took us a couple of hours each way at a leisurely pace. If you have the time during your stay in this area this really is a must do. We rented an apartment and the bikes were supplied but there are plenty of places in Santa Monica or Venice to hire bikes on a day or weekly rate.,ammoss
40,Good fun...,"My wife and I hired a tandem bike and rode down to Venice Beach from Santa Monica Pier. It's maybe 15 minutes and an easy ride. We hired our bike from Sea Mist bike rentals, which is right at the start of the pier on beach level. The bikes were just okay but if I did it again I'd get our bikes from The Bike Centre on the corner of Colorado & 2nd. They were newer. If you go on a Sunday the crowds are massive, so if you have a choice, try a week day.",Michael2810
50,A Must !!,"We rented bikes ( 4 of us with teenagers ) on a whim and it turned out to be one of the highlights of our visit to L.A. It's relatively inexpensive, you're about as fresh as the air will get in L.A and you see ALOT. The bike bath seems to go forevery and the rental bikes are very comfortable. It looks like you can rent them every 1/4 mile or so. We rented ours in Venice Beach and biked out to Santa Monica and beyond. My highest recommendation to everyone....and very few tiny hills.",kpattison
50,Great fun !,One of the best experiences of our trip to CA. The kids 17 and 13 really liked it . One of their favourite things to do on the trip. We started in Santa Monica and wwent through Venice Beach and a little further. It started to rain so we stopped for lunch at a nice place on the beach when the rain stopped we continued and everyone was happy. I highly recommend this activity . Such a lovely way to spend a day !,Rose S
50,Excellent way to relax and see the sights,"Along the coast so mostly flat, wide paved bike path, rode from the border of Malibu to past Marina Del Ray.

50,Great experience!,"We hired bikes and rode this bike trail, it was great fun and an excellent way to see a lot and cover more ground than by foot.

40,A great way to experience the beach,"While staying in LA we biked along this beach trail on 3 days. We biked between Manhattan Pier and Santa Monica Pier (approx. 12 miles).

50,"""My Bike Path"" Love it!","This is 'my' bike path...I live here in Santa Monica and use it as my freeway. This stretch of poured concrete sits on the sand along the Pacific every day of the week…just waiting for the rollerblading, biking, strollering, skateboarding, meandering masses. The crowds thin a bit in off-season, but the bike path is well travelled and inspiring just about any day of the year.Forgot to pack your rollerblades? No worries. Bike and skate rental places dot the full length of this little road-by-the-sea, which begins at Temescal Canyon Road in the North and then meanders South through the very famous Venice Beach, finally ending up at Washington Blvd. in Marina Del Rey. For more information go to: http://www.labikepaths.com/SantaMon.html AND if you can rent a helmet DO...I am sitting here as I type with a sprained ankle and stitches from a bike accident (it has given me time to write reviews but if I hadn't been wearing a helmet it would have been a different story) Not evangelizing but I know as a tourist in Paris, for example, I don't wear a helmet and I might just rethink that next time I'm there! :)",AFoolForTravel

The path is level (not surprising) and shared by walkers, joggers, and bikers. We rode in both directions from the Pier and found the pace very leisurely. We enjoyed seeing people on the beach as well as the homes that front the ocean. Venice Beach was a throwback to the 1960s and not a place we wanted to stop with our 10-year-old son.

It's a great way to truly relax and enjoy the ocean and the scenery of the mountains in the background.We also take our son with us sometimes on the ride and I swear its his favorite activity just sitting in the child's seat enjoying the ride. He is twenty months and can stay content for an hour just chillin on the bike. We love it.,Marcus W
40,"Scenic, easy does it ride","I really enjoyed riding this bike path. I began it in Santa Monica and headed towards Venice Beach and Marina Del Rey with the intent of riding all the way to Hermosa Beach. It's a beautiful and scenic ride, but it's hard to get much more than a mild workout in due to the fact that this path is heavily congested. There is a separate pathway for walkers but you still constantly come upon large groups of walkers sometimes blocking the entire path and you end up waiting for them to part. I realize that California and Santa Monica is an international destination and there may be a language barrier that many don't realize (due to that language barrier) that it's intended as a bike path. You do encounter lots of people who simply don't care that it's a bike path. If you're patient and looking for a very leisurely ride rather than a brisk pace, it's a great path. I finally gave up on riding for exercise one day and relaxed, parking my bike on Santa Monica Beach taking in the scenery. The scenic beauty along the way alone makes it worthwhile. If you are intent on making it a workout I would suggest you arrive early morning when there are far less people.",0221Serendipity

50,A South Bay Gem!,"We stayed on Hermosa Beach for a week and rode our own bikes on the Strand every day. Yes we did ride every inch!One of the things we enjoyed the most about our rides was that each trip provided us with some special and unique experience, dolphins swimming right off shore, different weather, the boats, interesting people, stopping at some great little cafe or coffee shop of which there are many along the way. Another favorite thing was the low cost for fun factor, as cheap a So Cal attraction as you'll find...I would also add that the path connects up with the Ballona Creek bike path where you might catch the UCLA rowing team in action or at least see some interesting birds and wildlife.I could go on and on but instead go see and enjoy the Strand bike path yourself!",ZONATRVLRS

50,What a great ride!,"If you ride from the top of the path in Santa Monica, all the way down to Redondo Beach, nearly the entire path is right on the beach. It may take you up to 3 hours one way, but its so much fun. You can see such a diverse group of people, towns and scenes. And if you go on the weekends in the summer, you're sure to see at least one volleyball tournament and a few free drink giveaways. Just about the whole trip is level, so no real hills to speak of.",Suziselt

The weekend can be hectic as people (mostly unaware tourists) stroll on the path, or weekend warriors biking, dragging their little kids without any concerns or caution. Keep your eyes open for children as they often make sudden stops or u-turns. If you love your kids, use a tandem bike.",streaker3

50,Scenic ride/walk/skate along an amazing beach,"I only hiked a few miles of this between Santa Monica and Venice Beach but it is really worth it (if I'd had more time I would have rented skates, there are rental places all along the beach).The great thing is that there are no streets nearby so it's all pedestrians and human-powered vehicles - lots of skaters and bikers. They have separate lanes to avoid conflict between people on wheels and those and foot. The pavement undulates nicely along the beach under the palm trees and makes you feel rather like you walked into a movie scene - at least during the day. Shortly after sunset I started to find the crowds a bit less inviting. I enjoyed it most in the mornings around 8, when a lot of people are working out in the sunshine in various ways.",Anke S

40,More excitement at the beach,"My husband and I brought our road bikes from the central coast of California when we visited the L.A. area in August (bicycle rental places are available everywhere, we visited Santa Monica Bike Center for information and later in our trip, utilized their bike parking service). There was a heat wave, which was just fine with us! We rode 80 miles during the course of our 4-day vacation, and did the ""South Beaches"" path on a Saturday afternoon. The majority of the path was very crowded with people of all ages on bicycles, skates, skateboards and foot. Navigating was tricky at some times! Also, we found it challenging to deal with the sandy parts of the path, as our bicycles have thin tires... not so much traction! The last stretch, as we neared Manhattan Beach, was less traveled and easier to navigate at higher speeds. All in all, it was a pleasurable experience and we will do it again on our next visit to the area!",SharineCalifornia
50,Refreshing with a view:),"This bike pathway will let you see places you can only dream about. Start by renting a bike at the pier then head towards malibu, then turn around towards the south, to Venice beach , make a left somewhere near Washington where it leads you to Marina del rey, past the inlet where you see the colorful array of kayakers, sail boats, and then past the bridge and then to the sands of El Segundo where you see planes takes off from LAX every 10 seconds or so and then to the trendy Manhattan beach where you can enjoy a game of beach volleyball on the south side of the pier or just reward yourself with a cold drink at one of the bars along the coast for that amazing bike ride:) Just be mindful of the pedestrians. They have the right to be there too:)",alincali

50,Great family activity,"Great family fun! Endless flat bike paths. And on the beach! Our tip: go under the Santa Monica Pier, bikes are decent quality and almost half the price of the ones you'll find on the pier",JFP
50,great for locals or visitors!,"The bike path is a great way to get some exercise and see the coast, from the South Bay all the way up to Palisades. There are plenty of bike-rental places (Perry's, etc.) and there is a pedestrian path running alongside much of the length (in the more popular areas- Promenade, Venice Beach). The only annoying thing is that pedestrians don't seem to want to take the separate walking path, so bikers and joggers have to keep a look out, or run over someone's child.The northern section of SM and Palisades is fairly empty, and has regular bathrooms and locking areas, if you'd like to get off your bike and enjoy the beach or rest. The Venice Beach section is winding, and sometimes covered in blown sand, but has many restaurants and attractions. The path seems to end in Marina del Rey at the pier, but there is actually a detour through Lincoln Blvd and the marina parking lot that puts you back out on the path so that you can continue your ride South.It's a great path for locals to get a workout, or for visitors to explore... but please watch when you cross, and if you're walking, stay on the walking path.",Ktschmatey

50,California the californian way,"Another unexpected entertainment experienced, as we arrived to the famous Santa Monica pier. The way it all started was because we parked to far away from the pier, and taking a walk towards the pier would have had taken too long for the short time we plan for this stop, so I was able to convince my family to rent the bikes that we nearby. The good thing was that there was also a three wheel bike for one of us who never learned to ride a bike (hahahaha), so we all jumped into the bikes, and had a wonderful time riding along the track bordering the sands of Santa Monica. Finally we reached the Pier, and took some more time to go into one of the rides of the small amusement park, walk around, couple of refreshments, and back to the place we parked the car. Do it!!! its a great way to live California as locals do.I think I paid 15$/hour for the bike rentals.",Oscar Rojas

40,Hard work on skates.,"I brought my artistic inlines with me all the way from Australia so I could skate this path. It was great, a really nice way to see the coast. However it is standard cement so it is not very smooth and can be a fair amount of work depending on your wheels and setup. I have PIC's with Axel wheels, which are really meant for wood floors. I noticed some skaters had larger speed wheel skates but most were rec, hocky or agressive skates. I'm guessing it's easier with those wheels.The cement is also done in blocks and the gaps can get quite large and need to be stepped over. I don't think people who aren't very experienced on blades should skate along here as there are a lot of bikes and it would be easy for them to trip on the cracks.",AbellaRose
