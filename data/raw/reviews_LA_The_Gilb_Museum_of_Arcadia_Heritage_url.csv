50,Just the right size,"Interesting exhibits, not too small that someone might roll his eyes but not too big that you need a really long time to get through everything. Friendly, helpful staff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJKFETP

50,what a gem!,"We almost skipped this - so glad we didn't! It's a small local history museum, but very well laid out & well maintained. Admission is free, but donations are certainly appreciated. The museum has various displays ranging from the early history of the area to some of the more recent people who have lived there or came from there. There is a lot of information to read, which is right up our alley. There is a small local artist exhibited in the back, which was interesting as well - she talked about the inspiration for each of her pieces. We were there close to 2 hours, but we like to read everything. We thoroughly enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Howietravels
30,"Small sized, limited collection, but serves the community well","The small size of this museum means you can breeze in for a quick visit. Focused on the History of the City of Arcadia, and the size of the collection is small compared to other similar type museum. The good thing is that a dedicated staff and devoted volunteers serve the community well. Lots of community programs for Scouts, special interests ( like historical photography), and events to bring in a large range of people. Worth a quick trip before going to the nearby Santa Anita Racetrack and/or arboretum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryI428
