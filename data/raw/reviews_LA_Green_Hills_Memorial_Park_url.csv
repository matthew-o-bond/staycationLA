50,The 34th Annual Memorial Day Tribute,"Green Hills Memorial Park held its 34th Annual Memorial Day event to honor the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. The Keynote Speaker was Major Scott Huesing, USMC (ret). He is the author of the book, ""Echo in Ramadi."" He served 24 years in the Marine Corps, with 10 deployments to many, many countries.As far as I'm concerned, this is one of the premier Memorial Day events in Southern California. I've attended over 20 of these events over the years. Thank you Green Hills for another amazing day of rememberance.",Robert L
40,Well Maintained and Peaceful but at a price !,"The place is definitely well maintained and peaceful. The character of the place is very different from the typical cemetery. However, this comes at a price, a very hefty price. From burial to headstones, they get you coming in and while resting. It is kind of sad that there is such a premium on death.",B C
50,They cannot but rest in peace!,"Green Hills Memorial Park is in Rancho Palos Verdes, Los Angeles, California.Ambling down Western Avenue one early evening, we came upon these beautifully landscaped rolling greens. Not quite sure what this park was all about, we entered the gates and soon realized we were in an exceptionally beautiful cemetery. We were told this facility that dates back seventy years to 1948, spans all of 120 acres.It is a truly beautiful place - a small fountain right at the gates and a gently gurgling stream welcome visitors. Broad curving drives take one up gently rising greens. Almost at the crest is the mausoleum and the chapel. The park that is demarcated into various sections is exceptionally well maintained, with lush green lawns, well tended trees, spotlessly clean roads and flowers of the most brilliant hues. These breathtakingly beautiful landscaped grounds overlook the Pacific Ocean and Los Angeles Harbour.Park hours are 7am through 7pm.This memorial park certainly lives up to its promise of ""Life Celebrated Perfectly""... and indeed for those interred here in such ethereal surroundings, they cannot but rest in peace!",TMenon
40,Funeral services,"I visited this cemetery for a few funeral services now. Very nice, peaceful park. I hope I don't get invited back here soon, but it's a nice place.",Paul
