30,Could be better,Not an easy place to find but we were determined to get there. If you are a fan of architecture you would want to visit here. Unfortunately the day we visited it was raining and there were no tours of the exterior of the house. Inside restoration works had a lot of the house closed off to visitors. The docents were friendly and knowledgeable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmazingGracie17
40,Frank Lloyd Wright at his best.,Took the outdoor tour where we learn a lot about the history of the house from the Docent. The outside is not typical of FLW but then you get to the inside: Wright at his best. Beautiful interior design. Lots of docents inside to answer your questions. Have been to a lot of FLW's homes. This one is as beautiful as the others with some unique features.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alaninphoenix
40,Interesting,The project would have been magnificent but the sponsor got tired of architect’s delays and astronomical numbers over budget. What remains is a beautiful park with a small museum and a Frank Lloyd Wright house.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/50Beatrizy
40,Wright in Hollywood,Well maintained FL Wright home with beautiful grounds and landscaping. It is situated in the Barnsdall arts colony(yes?) high on a hill in Hollywood with great views. Well informed docents. Well worth the trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/royd275
40,Enjoyed the Frank Lloyd Wright's House,We had a timed entry for a self guided tour of the Hollyhock House. We've toured several other Frank Lloyd Wright properties and this was the least impressive. There were several of the portions of the house that seemed completed but were blocked off from viewing. What we toured inside the house was impressive. The outside of the house was not overly impressive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adventurer1234
50,Beautiful house and grounds.,"Excellent FLW house with knowledgeable and nice docents. Beautiful restoration, grounds (except for that ugly fence.)"" Couldn't go into interior lawns.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jeffreyaday
50,Must-See Frank Lloyd Wright Landmark,"This was a great way to spend 2 hours. We did the outdoor tour and then visited the indoors which is staffed by four docents who are all eager to share their knowledge of the house.If you're a fan of Wright's buildings, this is a necessary visit. This house has the best fireplace in any Wright house that I've ever seen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Geoffrey1969
40,Interior more impressive than Exterior,"One feels that over time this house has been often both misused and misunderstood.Personally I found the austere exterior rather uniniteresting (even with a racoon sleeping on one of the ledges!!)I did like the interior and the staff and docents arevery, very knowledgeable and helpful",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobandJosie
50,Frank Lloyd Wright house on a Hill,"Quite an interesting docent led tour of the inside and outside of one of FLW’s jems. The owner had it built in 1919-21. A lot of the original furniture has been replaced but it is still an incredible work of art. Blocky stone outside, wood inside. I would recommend you buy tickets for the guided tour. For older people, the stairs are a little tricky. After the tour wander around Barnsdale Park, take in the panoramic view of Los Angeles, the Hollywood sign, and the Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skyros7
50,Delighted to find Frank Lloyd Wright design in the middle of LA!,"Came upon this historical and Frank Lloyd Wright designed home at Barnsdall Park. Had not known about it on my previous visits to LA. The tours (either outside or inside) are not frequent so you have to carefully check the website for days and times) are good. The self guided tour inside is fine. They may open more rooms to tour in November 2019? That’s the word I heard on my tour. Love the view, the history, the architecture. The lawn and grounds at the top of the park are interesting and a great place to see the sun set. Parts of the park itself are quite neglected. Go in daylight only.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/929ch
50,Lovely Place,I went with an architect friend who really knew about the place. I really enjoy seeing the place and made for a fun and interesting visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flyer780991
50,The docent-led tour of the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed building is fascinating,"For fans of Frank Lloyd Wright's architecture, this is a must-see. And for anyone else it would be worth a visit on its own merits. We took the hour-long docent-led interior tour. The docent was knowledgeable and the group is limited to 10 people, so there is no problem seeing and hearing everything, unlike some of the too-crowded historic home tours we have taken. It's a steal at $7 per person. The only drawback is that the indoor docent tours are offered only on Tuesdays and Wednesdays around lunchtime. Self-guided tours are offered Thursday through Sunday, but we haven't done that so can't offer an opinion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethht2016
30,Only got to see the exterior,"Unique and special exterior. But after driving quite a distance and up a hill, we arrived on a day that it was closed for inside visits. BE SURE to check the current opening hours before you go. We were very disappointed...and we weren't the only people who arrived at the wrong day. Even the gift shop and welcome center were closed...nobody in sight. This is owned by the City of Los Angeles - operated by the cultural affairs dept. Come on folks, with such an architectural treasure can't you afford to make it more accessible?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dangui
40,Great Frank Lloyd Wright House,"This is a typically wonderful Frank Lloyd Wright House with wonderful decor and a charming, cozy feel, along with a lot of typically interesting Frank Lloyd Wright innovations such as concrete front doors. It also has his typically poor functional characteristics - much of the house never worked properly, leaks like a sieve (like most or all his houses, I think), is in danger of falling apart, etc.It is at the top of a hill in West Hollywood area, now Barnsdall Art Park, giving nice views of the area.It suffers from some drawbacks, though. Typically for preserved Frank Lloyd Wright houses open to the public, one can't take pictures inside and I can never think of a valid reason. Much of the place is also closed off so one can't even go in large portions of the house, including some of the most interesting. Finally, it it surrounded by an unsightly fence so although one can always see the outside for free, even those who pay to go in must look at the outside through the fence, which really ruins the view of the building's exterior.A word of warning, especially to those with mobility issues - it is on tip of a hill requiring a bit of a walk, including stairs at one entrance. There is an elevator to the park but it was not functioning when we were there. That said, those with a car or taxi can drive almost up to the house.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenedc2016
40,Well preserved home in beautiful hill top.,Nice place to admire the quiet scenery and view the beautiful preserved home. Docents provide an enthusiastic sharing of the rooms and well preserved architecture. Be sure to tour the COLA museum on the same grounds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ECL
50,Wonderful historic Frank Lloyd Wright house,This was a wonderful significant Wright designed home even though the owner never lived in it. The details are amazing. I wish there was more of it accessible to see but I understand that they’re trying to preserve it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mako159
50,Great and famous monument by Frank Lloyd Wright,This house under architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright has a very special atmosphere. Different kind of wooden furniture and wall decorations The interior is really wonderful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AB_Stb_OZ
40,Frank Lloyd Wright,"Be sure to check the website to be sure when tours are being given. It is a great Frank Lloyd Wright house, and touring the interior is a pleasure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cookpias
50,Fascinating bit of History,"We took a guided tour of the Hollyhock House and learned as much about Aline Barnsdall as Frank Lloyd Wright! She was the visionary woman who hired (and then fired) FLW to build the house and an entire complex, with a theater and houses for actors and artists. This was the first house FLW was hired to build in Los Angeles in 1919, but as FLW had already committed to a project in Japan, his time and attention were focused elsewhere, and as he went over budget--both with time and money--Aline ran out of patience. Even though the main residence was finished, it was overseen not by FLW but by others on the team, and Aline never lived in it. A big shout out to our docent, Joan Yarfitz, who has a very wide knowledge of Hollywood and architectural history!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suecd48
30,Nice Frank Lloyd Wright property in LA,"We have been to 5 FLW places around the US including Taliesin, Taliesin West, Arizona Biltmore, and Falling Water, which is the pinnacle of his vision. Hollyhock house is a nice property and our Docent was very knowledgeable, but you are not able to visit the whole home and the restrictions for viewing are severe, as are the 'monitors' that make you feel like a suspect throughout the entire tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/STEIGERdog
40,Nice house for a quick visit,"Up on a big hill is a very striking Mayan-influenced FLW house built for an arts precinct. Some stunning rooms and angles combined with absurdly low ceilings. Wear booties, don’t take photos and there are many more staff than visitors if you have questions but you might still be done in 15 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrdom
50,A Frank Lloyd Wright gem,"One of several FLW houses in the LA basin, this beautiful home offers reasonable tours ($7) inside the fully restored interior. Self guided, but plenty of knowledgeable volunteers on hand. If you love American architecture, this is a “must visit”.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frndlyskies
50,Short but delightful tour of a Frank Lloyd Wright masterpiece,"Hollyhock House is a Wright creation commissioned by the owner to be a centerpiece of an arts center. We had a 45 minute tour with a friendly and expert tour guide, who emphasized Wright’s Mayan and hollyhock floral motifs. Original decorative pieces and furnishings are there - not always the case at other Wright sites. On summer weekends there are picnic trucks and music. $7 tour price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sydeleg
50,Beautiful building,We visited this house on the first morning of our stay in LA and it was one of our favourite mornings.Do yourself a favour and go on a group visit. It's the only way you can get into the house and the guides ( if ours was anything to go by) make the place come to life.We had never visited a FLW property before and it was fascinating to hear of his ideas at that time (we later visited Taliesin West)As a bonus you get to see the Hollywood sign from the site too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bettyUK
50,FLW Gem,"For any Frank Lloyd Wright fan, this little gem in the middle of a Los Angeles park is a must-see. It's a self-guided tour, with docents scattered around the house to answer your questions. It's been beautifully renovated and lovingly preserved.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flygirl215
40,Hollyhock: an Architectural Treasure,"This 1915-18 Frank Lloyd Wright masterpiece is very worth seeing. The interior is gorgeous but not allowed to be photographed. The Docents are knowledgeable and welcoming. I was here about ten years ago and back then, visitors could walk into all the rooms however now, the rooms are roped off so that you can only walk the main hall and look into the various rooms. Despite this, the open plan allows visitors to experience the spaces and visually stunning details up close.Outside, the place is now fenced off but one can still walk around the entire house to fully see the exterior. The views from this hilltop are stunning as you can see both Griffith Observatory and the Hollywood sign on the other hills. Bring a picnic blanket if you want to stay a while to enjoy the view.Tip: drop your group off at the top of the serpentine driveway then park either at the top (arrive early) or at the street level parking lot. There’s a stair at the far end that will take you firstly up the hill and up to the Guest House, under renovation. Buy tickets in the visitor center, the former 3-car garage, and see exhibit of photos of the house from the 1920’s.The $7 entrance fee is very reasonable and be sure students bring their student ID to get in for the $3 fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/516madelines
50,Walking visit to Hollyhock House,"This was a fascinating house featuring a great deal of crafted concrete moulding both interior and exterior. The docents were most professional. We loved the woodwork that was matched to the sameaztec-inspired theme. This was worth a tour for those interested in design, even if not devotees of Frank Lloyd Wright.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BruceC1562
50,Beautiful Frank Lloyd Wright designed house and furniture,We made a self guided visit to the house. There was a booklet fillet with information to pick up at the entrance so we could find out about each room but the several docents were very keen to provide further information to us. We spent about a half an hour in the house and found the rooms very beautiful. It was easy to park there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ros57
40,Worthwhile but Limited,"I purchased the last two tickets for the interior/exterior tour a few days in advance, so it appears to be necessary to book prior.The tour lasted approximately an hour and our docent was informative and helpful. The house itself is stunning and seems to be a work in progress in regards to ongoing periodic restorations.The highlight for me was the living room, in particular the stone carving above the fireplace and the water pit surrounding the fire - stunning. It’s a shame that so much of the house is off-limits due to the City of Los Angeles disability act restrictions, although the docent mentioned this might change shortly.No photography inside, outside only. Is it worthwhile - yes, just manage your expectations accordingly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicholastb
30,Don't Expect Too Much,"We got off to a bad start: Traffic was heavier than predicted, we found no signs identifying the property or advising us how to get to the Visitors Center. When we did get there, a couple of minutes later than the requested time but before the scheduled start of the tour, the door was just being unlocked and the staff spent the next five minutes fiddling with the computer. We felt ignored and unwelcome.We had reserved space on the docent-led tour and our docent was good. There's not a lot to see, though. Access is available only to rooms not requiring stairs and we were allowed only into the doorway of some of the rooms on the ground floor. To view the exterior, we had to walk on the outside of the fence around the property.If you want to see as many Frank Lloyd Wright works as you can, visit this one. If you want to be immersed in Frank Lloyd Wright and increase your understanding of his work and its place in the world, you can skip Hollyhock House.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Appleshine1
30,Too many rooms are roped off!,"Nice FLW house in a nice park. Easy to find and easy to park.The docents are plentiful, knowledgeable and friendly.But...Most of the house is roped off. You can't see anything! The self-guided tour grinds to a standstill! Short description of my visit - complete waste of money and very frustrating!Some lame explanation about the ADA and guidelines. I don't buy it.I was here a few years back and got a terrific complete, docent led tour. Those were the days!Skip this attraction!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunsetPelican
30,Too Little To See,I'm giving this a 3 because you are basically only allowed to walk in the entrance and look around. You can't enter any rooms and you don't see most of the house. Just the front. What they have done is great. The living room is amazing. The outside is good with great views. Too little inside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donmS7158RS
30,Frank Lloyd Wright lovers!,If you love FLW architecture this house is probably on your to do list. It was a great home but the access was very limited. Most rooms are blocked off and you can’t see many features of the house. The staff are very accommodating and knowledgeable. Great views from this hill.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaimieMB
50,Highly recommend,"The Hollyhock house is very easy to visit as there is ample parking, no crowds, it is centrally located and it is very reasonable, The house has been brilliantly restored to its original state on the inside. Only the ground floor rooms are open (living/dining/den) so it can be a very quick visit but is well worth it because it gives one the feel of exactly what it must have been like to live in a FLW designed home that is on a modest scale.Admission was only $7 so you really cannot go wrong visiting. It is at the end of Hollywood Blvd. A short 5-10 minute drive from the heart of Hollywood. Also Griffith Park observatory is about 10 minutes away so it is a very convenient stop between two major tourist destinations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julietk_11
50,Excellent Tour for the FLW enthusiast,"Like a lot of Wright's projects, it's finally found a deep-pocketed trust to keep it up, as the maintenance on these historic properties must be staggering, especially after falling into disuse during the decades before being genuinely appreciated. We learned (as you will) that Wright's design was only brought to fruition through one of his students, Rudolph Schindler (who has his own legacy, and his unusual (not in a good sense) home not far away, IMHO. Hollyhock is very much RECOMMENDED for the Wright enthusiast 😄👍🏼",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoodDealBob
50,Frank Lloyd Wright designed home,I enjoyed touring the Hollyhock house. I've toured his Home and studio in Oak Park and Robie house in Chicago so it was nice to see a different style.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Homerj64
50,Small but packs a punch,"It's a shame that so many people in LA haven't heard of Hollyhock, much less visited...though selfishly, it's great since you never have to fight for free parking or the perfect spot for the views of downtown LA, the Hollywood sign and Griffith observatory.This house is very much in line with Frank Lloyd Wright's love to blend outside and inside space. It feels like walking into a fascinating time capsule when you come in.There is a $7 self-guided tour, which is very much worth it. There's guidebook upon entry that gives a digestible background on the history and architecture. There are also several well-informed docents who are more than happy to share their knowledge. I had a great chat about all the salacious drama around Wright's extramarital affairs that eventually hurt his career.You don't need to love architecture to visit this place. It's a great visit for anyone!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jem2amae1
50,Hollyhock Magic,An amazing architectural wonder. A continued Hollyhock abstracted pattern is reminiscent of Beethoven's pattern in the 5th Symphony. The FLW furniture is also stunning.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenJ662
50,Beautiful FLW house,Well worth a trip. Minimal charge. Right next to LA County Art Museum. A great example of Wright's work.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sdog41
50,Very interesting visit,"I had one day in LA to do something and I already done the great art museums and city tours. Honestly, except for the Huntington Library (which is not in Pasadena), I am not an LA fan. So I checked Trip Advisory and found out about Hollyhock House. I love visiting Frank Lloyd Wright houses and this is one I didn't know anything about. The setting is lovely. I took the house tour (only $8.00) and learned so much about the house, it's history and the architects involved. The docent did a great job. Nice adult trip but not for the children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JillWendy
50,You don't just come for the views...,"I was looking for a few things to do in the LA area during my last visit that weren't your run-of-the-mill touristy things. Hollyhock was perfect for that; my friend who is from Orange County had never been.The man selling the tickets was one of the least enthusiastic people I've come across recently, so we did wonder if we would walk in, look around and walk out. Oh no. Instead the docents inside the house were fantastic. Well informed, well spoken, happy to pose questions about we felt about the space and also answer our questions. I studied FLW briefly during my degree while my friend knew next to nothing about him...and we both left with so much more knowledge.I honestly can't recommend a stop at Hollyhock House enough. For $7 each (parking was free!) it's totally worth an hour of your day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wherelolawent
30,Interesting twist on FLW design,"The house is a twist on frank lloyd wright's design style. Compared to other house tours, there was little to see at this house. I made a special trip to see this house and was disappointed that i could only see a few of the rooms. I was traveling on business and the tour alone. There are tour guides inside the house that were telling people more information about each room. It was interesting that because I was alone not one of them spoke to me but they would approach pairs of individuals and I had to walk up and listen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daretha11
30,Great location in Hollywood Area,"Its a cool house with a cool little museum attached to it, however you don't come for the house or museum, those are just the bonus points. You come to sit in the adjacent park and take in the views on the hill overlooking Hollywood and the Hollywood sign with the Observatory in the near distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleysK4355MG
50,FLW Craftsmanship at every turn!!,"Took our breathe away! So thrilled to walk through an actual FLW structure. Such craftsmanship, detail and creativity everywhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/18tammyd
40,Mayan Reference in Architecture,"Upon arriving at the top of the hill, we immediately noticed the fantastic view of Los Angeles and Hollywood. The cool breeze was a nice surprise. We spoke with a few of the docents that were very knowledgeable of Frank Lloyd Wright and his achievements in Architecture of the Hollyhock House. It’s a nice place to stop and relax. I enjoyed viewing the reference to the beautiful flower that is repeated throughout this Mayan inspired home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Homecoming80
50,classic,"it's surprisingly BIG...the view is stunning, and you can see right away from the outside why Wright is such a big deal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnRyan724
40,Worth a Visit if you enjoy Frank Lloyd Wright,Had free time on Sunday and Love Frank Lloyd Wright architecture. Sometimes I feel like I was born in the wrong century. The house is amazing and only a $7 entrance fee. It was disappointing that the upper levels are closed unless you can take a weekday tour to see more of the house. The grounds tour was not even running. Water features were also dry. Virtual tour give you a better look at the entire property but definitely doesn'f give you the feel that his houses create.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/789roystons
40,Interesting house - talk to the docents!,"My friend and I really enjoyed our tour of Hollyhock House. There are a couple of options you can choose from, including an exterior guided tour and a self-guided interior tour. The house is the earliest example of Frank Lloyd Wright's architecture in Los Angeles, and it's unlike other FLW homes I've toured. It's very interesting. Currently not that much of the home is open to the public due to ADA (Americans With Disabilities Act) access, however one of the docents inside the house told us that they are planning on opening additional spaces in the house to the public this year (2018). You can see the den, the library, the dining room, the kitchen (through the view of the dining room), and a few other rooms. You cannot currently see any of the bedrooms. However, the docents are extremely helpful. We stopped to ask a docent a few questions about the house, and she showed us multiple photographs on her iPad of areas of the house that cannot currently be accessed by the public. All in all, it was an interesting and beautiful house to explore - and only $7 for the self-guided tour. I very much recommend that you ask questions of docents as they are very knowledge and will show you pictures of parts of the house you would not otherwise be able to see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexisrachelletx
40,Frank Lloyd Wright designed Hollyhock House,"Any chance to see a Frank Lloyd Wright home should be acted upon. The house is on a gorgeous piece of property near Hollywood. The house has been restored beautifully and it an outstanding representation of Wright's work. The background story regarding the owner is also interesting. There are many docents available to answer questions. I would have liked to have more of a guided tour experience, or at least have someone point things out in each given area. Compared to other Wright home tours, I felt that the actual experience was not as informative and organized as other places such as Falling Water and the Meyer May House.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandy42256
30,Nice house but,"For some reason they believe because they are county owned, they need to comply with the ADA, and so nothing that requires stairs (like the entire second floor) is closed to the public. The single, huge piece of rug is cool as is the “moat” around the fireplace",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaminDC
50,Great restoration of a Frank Lloyd Wright home,We visited while in town for our kids spring break. Even though we have young kids they enjoyed it and the self guided tour was fun and kept them interested. An amazing house in an amazing location.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoshuaK195
50,The 'Wright' House to Visit,"If you like Frank Lloyd Wright, you can't go 'wrong' to visit this house. It was built on a 30-acre hill in Los Angeles for Aline Barnsdall in 1921 by Frank Lloyd Wright though, before it was finished, she had fired him and his son and another architect finished it. It has many of the the hallmarks of the Wright style, the low entry opening up into the wides spaces of the house itself, the beautiful furniture, the erasing of lines between the outside and inside, the setting incorporating the views of downtown area.It is a self-guided tour but there are docents throughout to answer any questions, Since the second floor is not open to the public, we were lucky to find a docent who had pictures of it all.Amazing house and full of the 'Wright' touches. You can't go 'wrong' here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancyF406
40,Wonderful house and property,Nice outside intro tour and then toured the house. Beautiful and unusual as most FLW homes are. Amazing living area and fireplace. Guides very informative and helpful. Upstairs is closed and unfortunately no photos allowed but still exciting to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VVThanx
50,Outstanding,This was an amazing tour of Wright’s hill top mansion thanks to tour guideHarry F. This was a special surprise for me thanks to having an amazing retired architect as a guide. There is no way you can truly grasp this experience without a quality guide.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yogiacomo
50,Frank Lloyd WRIGHT at his best,"This is a great MUSEUM with a park , Barnsdall, to enjoy as well.The Museum(S) feature the architecture of Frank Lloyd WRightand they can't be beat. There are also concerts at theadjacent theatre as well as dance performances etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RKZ90027
50,Delightful interior and informative tours,"This was my first visit to a FLW building and expectations were high - thankfully they were met. While not all of the house was open to visitors, the areas that are open are beautifully presented and worthy of careful inspection, this is a fascinating building with some very interesting detailing.We commenced our visit with the external tour and this is well worth doing to understand the background and context for the development of the site.Good points:+ Beautifully presented interiors+ Informative docents+ Parking close to the houseNot so good points:- The docents can be rather over protective and touchy about the building (I touched the edge of the cast concrete pivoting entrance door and got a ticking off shortly before a docent demonstrated how it worked to another visitor)- The vehicle entrance from Hollywood Blvd is easy to miss (when you turn in, drive past the lower car park next to the road and proceed up the access road past the guest houses and to the parking bays just below the main house itself)- The name 'Barnsdall Arts Park' suggests that there may be other things to see such as garden sculpture but in reality it is just so named because of the adjoining arts center- Don't confuse the Hollyhock House with the privately owned Ennis House, which is 2 miles to the north and very rarely open to visitors",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Corb2000
40,Beautiful arcitechure and history,I have always admired the design of Frank Lloyd Wright homes but never had a chance to visit one. When I learned about Hollyhock during my trip planning to LA I knew I had to go. It is a beautiful small house on a gorgeous piece of property. The guides are very informative and I learned so much about the history of the house while being able to admire the beauty of it. It is not a long tour but it was worth the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Myflowergirls2
50,Stunning House With a Commanding View!,"I love Frank Lloyd Wright and strive to visit as many of his structures as possible. This was may second visit to the Hollyhock House in 8 years, and it was just like visiting for the first time! With admission of just $7, it is also a great bargain!On this second visit, I was with a group of architecture buffs so we had a docent-led tour (usually, the tour is self-guided but is great because you see so much of the home). Our docent was deeply knowledgeable and it was a joy to tour with her!The house is a stunning example of Wright's work, and the story of Aline Barnsdall is also very interesting. The location on a prominent hilltop affords a wonderful view to the nearby Ennis House (which sadly, is not open to the public). What I especially like about the Hollyhock House is that every major interior room adjoins an equivalent outdoor space. The effect is magical!I highly recommend a visit to this architectural gem!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jameskul
40,Gives you just a taste leaving you wanting more,"The Hollyhock House is a beautiful estate with an interesting history. If you enjoy touring homes, you will enjoy it, especially Frank Lloyd Wright lovers HOWEVER you really don’t get to see much. You have very limited access to the home because much is roped off. What you can see is fantastic but I just wish there was more for us to experience. I had higher expectations for Frank Lloyd Wright’s first LA project.If you time your visit right and/or plan ahead, you can get a free docent tour which is really a history briefing in the parking lot. Once this is done, you enter the house for a self guided tour with the help of a printed guide and the staff who are inside that can answer any questions you may have.There are continuing renovations on other parts of the property which I hope will help enhance ones experience here.The gift shop is lackluster and not one where you would linger about looking at items, it’s main function is to sell the tickets.The surrounding Barnsdall Art park offers a wonderful spot to take photos of Hollywood or simply relax enjoying the wonderful views.The Municipal Art gallery is small but worth a visit while there.The whole experience took only 90 minutes (docent talk, home tour and museum visit)Parking is free and ample.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MadamVeuve
50,Beautiful Historic Place,"I’ve always wanted to see a Frank Lloyd Wright house in person ever since I researched his work and looked at pictures of places like Fallingwater. I’m incredibly fortunate in this case that one of his properties is near where I live and is open to the public (he has more houses in the area but the rest are privately owned). The staff is very friendly and I really enjoyed the docents’ insights about this place. This is an incredibly gorgeous and unique architectural landmark inside and out, there’s really nothing else like it in the world. A wide variety of styles are being employed from Mayan to Greek and even Japanese. There are a lot of abstract geometric motifs used throughout that make this place more than just a house (which no one ever lived in mind you), but a true work of art. One of the docents pointed out on a short tour another FLW house that could be seen in the distance (the Ennis House) which was also very cool. You can’t take any pictures inside the house but just know that it’s absolutely lovely. They also provide you with shoe covers if you go inside in order to avoid damaging the floors and to further preserve the building. All in all, a pretty short visit all things considered but it was wonderful and I’m happy that the city has taken good care of this historic asset for everyone to enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colbys2014
50,Hollywood’s Hollyhock,"As a young actor living in Los Angeles in 1979 I discovered Barnsdall Art Park and the Frank Lloyd Wright designed Hollyhock House. It is an excellent example of Mr. Wright’s style of architecture. Located just off Hollywood Blvd., in a beautiful park setting, it offers a respite from Lala land. Over the years I’ve returned a few times and it remains a favorite place to visit. Happy trails.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/569claudef
40,Architecture at its best,This Frank Lloyd Wright home is one of my favorites by him. Loved the tour and the staff/volunteers were so knowledgeable about the architect and this home. Just wish the surrounding area was better cared for.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deonna2
50,Rare opportunity to visit a Frank Lloyd Wright House,"Located on top of a hill in Barnsdell Art Park (a city park), in East Hollywood with a 360 degree view of the LA region (there is free parking at the bottom of the hill in the olive grove, or on top of the hill near the house, there is handicap parking at the top near the house entrance. The docents seem very happy to provide an overview, tour or just answer questions. Large sloped lawn to picnic on the grass, there is also the LA Municipal Art Gallery (free) with diverse exhibits, several other cultural venues from time to time at the site. Call first the hose opening schedule seems to be governed by a variety of factors (house admission $7; seniors & students $3; children with adult free).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jazzradio
50,Impressive historical site,I really enjoyed my visit to Hollyhock House. It is quite cheap to enter and you're given a guidebook so it's easy to make your own way round. Both the exterior and the interior are well designed and enjoyable to look around. It's quite small and you really only need 30 minutes to see it all. There are also plenty of volunteers around to answer any questions you may have.Note: If you're getting around by public transport it's in a very convenient place - Vermont/Sunset on the Metro Red Line. This is midway between Downtown and Hollywood so this house could be combined with a visit to either of these other places.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephensH3674DY
50,Stunning Frank Lloyd Wright,A must if you love architecture. This Frank Lloyd Wright masterpiece was built for heiress Alice Barnsdall. Closed for many years it was recently renovated and opened to the public. Small but you get a great appreciation of the genius of Wright. No photos allowed inside but a great experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/509waynem
50,Beautiful architecture hidden in Hollywood,"My boyfriend and I love architecture tours and heard about the Hollyhock House hidden in Hollywood. Perched on top of a hill with sweeping 360 views of Los Angeles, Hollyhock is a must see if you love architecture. Frank Lloyd Wright built the house of concrete (which surprisingly was never lived in).There is free street parking in front of the house on the hill, and tickets were purchased in the garage area to the left of the house. Tickets were reasonably priced and tours are self guided. The house isn't too expansive and there were many guides standing around to tell you about the history of the place.I would definitely recommend if you are a tourist and a resident of Southern California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennifergO4549WT
40,Hollyhock House tour - Frank Lloyd Wright in Los Angeles,"This tour does not compare with the Frank Lloyd Wright house tours available elsewhere like in Oak Grove, IL or Teliesin West in Scottsdale, AZ, but it is one of the few examples of Frank Lloyd Wright's architectural design that you can visit in Los Angeles where there are still some of his buildings remaining. Unfortunately, the tour is limited to only a small portion of the Hollyhock House, and only limited to a few rooms on the ground floor. You really don't get to go outside and see the house up close as there is a fence around the house that keeps you some distance from the exterior. It is interesting to see the ""Hollyhock"" flower them throughout the building in abstraction and though the tour is limited, you can enjoy the enthusiasm and genius of Frank Lloyd Wright. It is located in Barnsdall Park which is a haven from the madness and busyness of LA on Olive Hill above East Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech522
40,Beautiful Frank Lloyd-Wright,"It's not a big place and the moment you can only view the ground floor, but what you can see has been restored to a high standard. Most items of furniture have been specifically designed for the house -we loved the lounge carpets/ rugs. It's worth going on the regular guided tour of the outsideIt's the only Frank Lloyd-Wright publicly owned property cost $7Great views of Mount Lee Hollywood sign and Griffiths ObservatoryYou cannot take photos inside",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisjoanneh
30,$23 to see 4 rooms......,"Don't get me wrong: the house is beautiful, but you only get to see 4 rooms. It took us 20 minutes to see everything and we were going slow. In my opinion too expensive for what you get.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Milo1967
30,Limited Access to the Residence,I was looking forward to visiting Hollyhock House having just visited Fallingwater in Pennsylvania last Fall. Hollyhock was closed for several years for repairs and restoration. You only get to see three or four room. The grounds are not in good condition and the overall appearance of the facility is that of disrepair and lack of grounds maintenance. The visit was a disappointment. Do not recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twaone
50,Frank Lloyd WRIGHT ON!,"Inspiring treat to visit this inimitable home-never-lived-in, particularly intrigued by the water system to his gold-tiled moat in front of fireplace. Whoda thunk?! The volunteer docent Jennifer, an architect herself, was delightfully informative and passionate about the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieStoneybrook
20,A beautiful park but a dissapointing venue,"The Hollyhock house is a beautiful building in Barnsdale Park. It was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and it will be a great place to visit, but not now. There are a lot of level changes throughout the house so that means a lot of steps and because of that, most of the house is non handicap compliant. That means at least 3/4 of the rooms are roped off, so you have to stand in hallways and look into many of the rooms. A guide said that they have asked for a waver from the city to lift the handicap restriction but it could be nine months or more before it's issued. I'd wait if I were you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Banerman
40,This is a hidden gem of a place,Wasn't aware this place even existed until I read about it in the lonely planet LA guide book. It's a real gem and it's quick and $ 7 to get in a bargain. You can only see a few of the rooms but they have been lovingly and accurately restored. Worth a trip in my opinion especially if you are Frank Lloyd Wright fan and into architecture.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brooklyn478
40,Amusing beginnings,"The Hollyhock House was the expensive investment of an oil heiress who spent close to $500K, and when all was said and done, only lived in the house very briefly. But how lucky for us that she later donated the property to the state on the condition that it was used to promote the arts. And it's a beautifully kept home, high atop the hill in what is now Barnsdall Arts Park. Imagine what it was like to have that aerial view of the city before all the high rises went up. You'll have to buy tickets to tour the Hollyhock House, which includes docent-guided tours, held during certain times of the day. These tours give a decent history of the house and its beginnings. The home itself is, characteristic of Wright's buildings, small, and you are permitted to view only certain rooms up close. Docents are on standby to answer questions. Parking is available (go to the top of the hill), but limited at the top. It's also a lovely spot for a picnic when the weather is right, as lush greens surround the house.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/longstrangejourney
50,A Frank Lloyd Wright gem in the middle of the city--just look up on top of a hill as you walk down Hollywood Blvd!,"If you love the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright you will not be disappointed with your visit to this home in the middle of LA, on a hill with a view and a cool breeze for a summer day. We were staying nearby and could not believe our good fortune to be able to walk to this gem. In addition to the home, it would have been nice to know that picnics seem to be allowed on the grass surrounding the home. Wow! That would have been a great plus. Much is under restoration but what you can see is worth the admission and then some. Go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaViajera007
40,Beautiful home,$6 or so for a self guided tour. Unless you are into architecture you can do it pretty quick. Large park area around it for a picnic and free parking. Nicely restored and worth the time if for the city view if nothing else.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jdk_mn
50,A Real Treat to See the Restoration!,"Friends took us to see the newly restored Hollyhock House, and it was very impressive. Don't be fooled by your arrival into the courtyard with the city art facility, which is a sad imitation of Wright's style. Follow the path to the visitor center, buy your tickets and take the tour. The house is lovely, and the interiors are beautifully restored. The views from the grounds are also breathtaking. Worth the admission!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lubbock09
50,Beautiful place!,"We finally were able to venture down to see the Hollyhock House. The hollyhock flowers around the home were in full bloom, beautiful and colorful! It took 4 yrs to renovate ($4.4 million, completed in 2015). Be sure to take the free outside tour by docents. It's about 20 mins long with fabulous views. Inside the house is a self-guided tour and if you have any questions, the docents are informative and friendly.The fee is minimal, but they only accept credit cards and there is no gift shop.Also in Barndall Park is the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery. We did not visit it, but would be nice for next time I take others to see Hollyhock House.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AbbySnacks
30,Lovely quick visit for Frank Lloyd Wright fans,"An unexpected oasis of serenity atop bustling Hollywood hills.Loved reading / hearing from very knowledgeable docents about the history of the place. And especially loved the geometric interpretation of original owner Aline Barnsdall's favorite flower - for which the house is named - and how the design theme is carried through the molding, custom furniture and carpeting. The fireplace was also pretty spectacular with its futuristic/ Mayan inspired mantel design + moat + wood framed skylight bringing in fire, earth, light and water to the heart of the house. Too bad the water system designed to flow from outdoors into the interior fireplace moat and back out the other side didn't end up working, but the concept and build still were breathtaking.During my visit only the self-guided tour was available, but there were plenty of docents around you can ask questions of. The visit was short compared to other FLW houses, only a few rooms and passageways were open for viewing - bedrooms were closed off to visitors.But for $7 not a bad way to spend an afternoon, and since the house is part of a public park, you can also bring your own picnic basket & wine and enjoy the sweeping views of LA after, including Griffith Observatory and the Hollywood sign.Parking is free and do drive all the way up to the top of you don't want to trek up the hill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/onemorebiteblog
50,Fabulous Frank Lloyd Wright House in LA,"Who could imagine such a serene setting in the middle of a busy East Hollywood neighborhood? Barnsdall Park is a hilly oasis surrounded by franchises. Once you park and walk to the Hollyhock House, you feel the calm and quietness.I'm a Frank Lloyd Wright fan and wanted to see his work in Southern California. The Hollyhock House has a self-guided tour which you can study online before you go. Once you arrive, it's fun to engage with very knowledgeable Docents who are eager to point out features that you otherwise might miss. We all had a very delightful afternoon - off the beaten path!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/81marilyns
40,A fun one in LA for Frank Lloyd Wright fans,"A beautiful house sits atop a hill in the middle of Hollywood. Built before the Hollywood sign or Griffith Observatory were built, but beautiful views of both. The house is intricate on both the inside and outside and a definite for a die-hard Frank Lloyd Wright fan. You will only see pictures from the outside as no photography is allowed indoors. And as many others have mentioned, only the main rooms are available, you won't be able to see the bedrooms and only get a glimpse of the kitchen. But the docents were extremely friendly while I was there, explaining about the different rooms and asking if we had any questions (which I wish I would have thought of more while I was there). Be sure to time your visit with one of the complimentary docent guided outdoor architecture tours (takes about twenty minutes). I would suggest trying to get there just as they open at 11 to do this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/55kristig
40,Compelling But Limited,"If you are a fan of FLW and/or ""California Romanza"" architecture, do stop by. But prepare to see only a few rooms, dazzling and daunting though they are. The imposing exterior reflects Mayan to space age sensibilities, but you can't walk around most of it. The view from the hill (Olive Hill) is fantastic - the Hollywood sign and the Griffith Observatory. The site is a public park so you can picnic or just relax and enjoy the vista. Refurbishment is ongoing. $7.00 entry fee/free parking. Glad I saw the house, but wish more of the rooms were available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chariot1457
40,"Beautiful house, fun for FLW fans","A small, private house, donated to the City and open for viewing. Friendly, knowledgeable docents. Bedrooms not open and kitchen only viewable from afar. Spend about half an hour there. An adjacent studio has art exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/follylover
20,limited access and rude docents,"The house is beautiful and unusual, but only a few rooms are open and photos are prohibited inside. The entire house is surrounded by a tall wire fence limiting access and photo ops outside, too. And a group of docents gathered by the front door and held a loud, personal conversation during my entire visit -- making it difficult to concentrate on the brochure I was given.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chiandretired
50,Amazing house,"An amazing house by Frank Lloyd Wright. I have been in Chicago in his own house but this one was even better. The view from the hill is unique. The interior spaces were beautiful, well organized and warm. All of the furniture also designed by him in his style. Must visit for all architects.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexiosVandoros
40,A must for architecture fans,"This is a must for architecture fans, especially those who appreciate Frank Lloyd Wright's work. The house showcases how his style evolved over time. And it has wonderful examples of deign, interiors, exteriors, furniture, and more.It's also a fascinating story: how he was hired and eventually fired from finishing this house. The docents pointed out some innovative design ideas that did not work which was also very intriguing. I walked around and came away with ideas for my own house. Since they do not permit photos of any kind indoors, take your sketchbook with you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_Daphne1734
50,Like Being Inside a Work of Art,"We decided to visit Hollyhock House as we had been to Wright's Falling Water and loved it. We were not disappointed. Wright's architectural genius is evident in this house that was never a home for the heiress who had it built. Do not skip the docent tour of the grounds before entering the house. Our guide, Floyd, was enthusiastic in his description of the history of the property and its eccentric owner. He also pointed out architectural details that we might have missed. No photos are allowed inside the house, but the docents are happy to point out the furniture that is original and remodeling that has restored the house to its original concept. An unforgettable visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/952lindag
20,Save your money,Only a few rooms are open in this 7500 square foot masterpiece by Frank LLoyd Wright.The docents are crabby and spew questionable information,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/latool
50,FLW's LA gem,"I've visited many Wright buildings. His creativity always lifts my spirits. Considering how famous Hollyhock is, it's a rather low-key attraction. The Wright sites of the Midwest, where I live, are a much bigger deal. That's not so bad. I didn't miss the usual big, overpriced souvenir shop. And I didn't miss the reverent attitude that Midwestern docents have to ""Mr. Wright,"" who can do no wrong. My big tip at Hollyhock is, talk to the docent. They don't do official tours, and the man who opened the house for us said that often visitors don't want to listen to him. Mistake! He knew a lot about the house and Barnsdall and Wright and their tangled relationship. He was candid, witty, interesting. A downside is that not much of the house is open to visitors. But the rooms that are, are fascinating, especially the beautiful living room. It was raining heavily, and we got to see at first hand that what everybody says is true: Wright houses have leaky roofs!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/devlin52
50,Amazing hidden gem in LA,Worth a visit even if you don't follow architecture views over city give a new perspective. Interior beautiful ask about why the ceiling is so low in some areas.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/priscilla977
40,Unique house in a unique setting,"This house was yet another lovely example of Frank Lloyd Wright's unique style. There is rather limited access to the rooms that you can view (no walk throughs), no kitchen viewing for example, so the time needed to see this house is not as demanding as others. You will not need to buy advance tickets as is necessary for some of his other houses, but the entrance fee is much more reasonable also. Unfortunately, the day we visited, the gallery portion was closed and we were unable to view some of the old photos and other historical ephemera that were on site. The docents were extremely well informed and very willing to discuss any and all aspects of the house and its history. Worth a trip into Hollywood to see it and you don't need a huge amount of time either.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dee490
50,An Architectural must for Frank Lloyd Wright fans,"Not all rooms are accessible, but visiting Hollyhock House is well worth the trip. I found the docents to be well informed and willing to share the history of the home. There was an original,Lionel train set up around the Christmas tree and the grounds visible from the house were well kept. I am glad to see a little part of history rescued from the wrecking ball!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bonne306
50,engaged docents make the best of the house,"Only a limited number of rooms open, and you 'view' them rather than walking through. Nevertheless the space itself is stunning, and it's hard to imagine the original owner chose not to live there. Feels very inviting to me. The criticism is, that like many FLW homes, it is more a triumph of design and less one of function, but I could see myself very comfortable in that space (of course you do not see the bedrooms, and we're told they are actually rather incomplete - the design was not fully developed - or realized). It is a worthwhile addition to your FLW collection, but a shame there is neither photography inside nor any booklets available for purchase with pics to reference. They do not monetize the gift 'shop' properly at all. There is an adjacent arts center which is full of the odd, but on this visit, an interesting photography exhibit/book about one woman's time in the Cali correctional system. She writes with good description and insight - not maybe what one was expecting, but a worthwhile look inside an experience that most of us (hopefully) will not know firsthand.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottrA3361XW
50,A Gem!,"Don't miss this architectural gem in the middle of Old Hollywood. The breathtaking views from Barnsdall Park include the Hollywood sign, Griffith Park Observatory, Hollywood and Los Angeles. The home has been beautifully restored and features Frank Lloyd Wright's original furniture. A guided tour with a docent is a must to get the most out of your experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/324AnneG
40,Unusual house by a genius architect!,"For years, I have read about this unique house based on the old-fashioned flower, the hollyhock. Even though you are limited to the number of rooms you can visit, what you do get to see is just wonderful! I wish they had been able to fill the moat around the fireplace with water (as it was intended to do). The docents were very knowledgeable. A video on Frank lloyd Wright (particularly as it relates to this house) would have been a nice addition.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/margaretmI9666TA
50,"Got the pre-ordered private tour for up to 10 people...at $70, a good buy","The docent was worth it....so enthusiastic, so informed, so into the house, history, neighborhood, architecture. He knew about the Barnsdall family, Frank Lloyd Wright and the history of how the Hollyhock House evolved...and it evolved! The story of Los Angeles architecture figures into the story which made each of us more intrigued. The restoration of the house is a good work in progress.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoxanneM723
20,Underwhelming house visit,A bit ridiculous to pay $7 for what this house visit is. You cant even see the whole house! The fence around the house is also a poor choice. Just a cheap looking metal fence that looks temporary as opposed to something that matches the beauty of the house itself,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikiJuli
50,Friday night wine tasting and tour of Hollyhock House,Spent a Friday evening at Hollyhock House a Frank Lloyd Wright house in Hollywood. The tour was great and informative and the wine tasting was a blast. The lawn on the west side of the home was filled with a fun crowd. Surprisingly there were no California wines to taste.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bill821
40,Great Frank Lloyd Wright house,"Aline Barnsdall loved hollyhocks and you can see how Frank Lloyd Wright incorporated them in the furniture and rug designs as well as on the inner and outer walls. As noted in other reviews, visitors can unfortunately only view the first floor of the home. The docents are wonderful and very willing to talk with you about the history of the house.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cleomissy
30,I Little Disappointing,"After being closed for many years, the Hollyhock House is open again, although there is more restoration to do and many areas are still closed. I had toured the house twice before the closure and somehow remember it as being better. Only part of the house is open and then, several rooms are only viewable from the surrounding hallways, such as the living room, dining room, kitchen. There is no photography inside the house which always ruins a tour for me with my expensive camera turned off at my side. Photography is allowed outside and you can get some good shots through the fence. There is a guided outdoor tour and station interpreters inside. I'll have to find my slides from 30 years ago.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
50,Two stunning rooms!,"My recent visit to the Bachman-Wilson House at Crystal Bridges highlighted the good and the bad about Hollyhock House. The good: the wealthy client, Aline Barnsdall, gave FLW the opportunity to work on a larger scale; the two rooms (living room and dining room) that LFW furnished were beautifully restored and are magnificent; the docents were friendly and knowledgeable. The bad: Mrs. Barnsdall fired FLW before the rest of the planned arts complex was built. She only let FLW furnish the two rooms, then never moved in, so most of the house is unfurnished. The house is in a public park - a gift of Mrs. Barnsdall to the City of Los Angeles - while that might have been a good idea at the time, the City doesn't have the resources to restore it like Crystal Bridges does. A lot of outside work needs to be done, and a second FLW house on the site is just sitting there decaying. It is definitely worth seeing - especially if you are a billionaire with the vision to see how much more magnificent this could be with the right patron.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JedC
40,Don't miss this gem if you are in the area,"This house museum is located in the general area near the Griffith Park Observatory. So if you have some interest in architecture, Los Angeles history, or just need a litte break this would be a great stop.It's $7 to get in, with discounts for seniors. I don't think this would be a good stop for children since it is a major ""don't"" kind of place. Although if you have children you could trade off since there is plenty of space to run and play outside of the house.Don't park at the bottom. You can drive all the way to the top. Once inside the docents are truly amazing. These are not your usual docents. These docents really know a lot MORE than just the house. Probably some of the most knowledgeable docents I've had the pleasure to meet in a LONG time. Ask them about the other FLW houses, ask them about LA history, movie connections, and local stuff. They know it all! Ask, ask, ask. The docents really make this museum wonderful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Todd2PS
40,A Shinning Star,"A beautiful FLW house compilation. Well worth the vist. One woman's dream, her vision, comes to fruition as her Art Park continues to have and be ~ art for all. The City of LA could put a bit more love & care to the; home, grounds, art park, and art center. Take the time to explore. Be sure to catch the free docent tour, sign on when you purchase your entry ticket. Well worth it, I learned a great deal abot FLW & Ms Barnsdall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAR411
50,You don't want to miss this!,"Friends suggested this as a destination. I wasn't thrilled but we went and I am so glad. The house was restored as close to the original as possible at a cost of $5,000,000. It only recently reopened and it sparkles. The docents had many stories to tell (not all of them agreed) but it added immediacy to the tour. There are gorgeous views of LA as it sits on a hill and so you have 360 degree vistas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathyh79
40,Wright at his most intriguing,"Beautiful Second Stage Wright. Surprising in its fortress like massiveness, there is still lots of light and air. Love the little individual writing desks; the huge living room window; and the carving over the fireplace. Under repair & renovation, way too much currently unavailable to view--wait another year to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizd775
40,Frank Lloyd Wright-ON!,This is the perfect destination date. The house is relatively small so it only takes a few minutes to tour. Group who's ages ranged from 9 to 89. We all loved it. Pack a lunch and spend some time on the Lon enjoying the view of the Los Angeles Hills. You can see Griffith Park Observatory and one of Frank Lloyd Wright's other masterpieces.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Naninofro
50,Important architectural stop in LA,"Frank Lloyd Wright, his students, colleagues etc. all did a lot of work in Southern California. This project (and it is more than a house) for Mrs. Barnsdall was created between 1919-1921. The site is/was sufficiently huge that it is now an entire park given by Mrs. Barnsdall to the city of Los Angeles. Many of the FLW stylistic signatures, inside and out, are present here and the Barnsdall project, Hollyhock House, is obvious in its place among major Wright creations. There is no tour but there will be a couple of knowledgeable docents inside the house. I believe there is a tour given of the exterior space. Worthwhile for those interested in architecture and architectural history (and indeed Barnsdall and Wright fell out over the project and Barnsdall never took up residence in the house).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nurealam
50,Great views,I love touring homes and looking into the history. This is such a wonderful home and furnishing to see. The indoor outdoor spaces are amazing. There are great views from each window. The holly hocks are in cubism on the outside of the house. They are in the Windows in the house. The dinning room set also are an interpretationOf hollyhocks. The fire place is cast cement and I love the furniture and artwork in the living room. It has such an amazingSpace. Great view of the observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travlerlee
50,Interior visit goes quickly; pack a picnic,"We thought this would take a bit longer, but we spent about 30 minutes in the Hollyhock house. It was impressive! I've been a fan since seeing this building in books, and for those who enjoy FLW, it's definitely worth it to see the interior. From what I understand, it's the only FLW house like this open to the public in LA. The self-guided tour was great-- they provide brochures and original photos, as well as docents in many rooms to help understand the history of the house. It's a stunning building with very strong, modern, almost space-age design. Pack a picnic and relax on the grounds before/after. There is an excellent view of LA and of the Hollywood sign in particular. On Fridays there is apparently a wine event open to the public.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/priyas454
50,Fan,I have visited many of Frank Lloyd Wright's sites and as usual this house in Barnsdale Park is spectacular. The docents are very attentive and well informed. Art museum in Park had a very interesting collection of different media focused on ethnicity.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VARobinson
50,Hollyhock house- second times a charm!,"This was actually my second visit to the house. Upon my first visit, shortly after the house reopened, I of course appreciated the historical significance(and the beauty)of the house, but in all honesty,the docent guiding our tour didn't quite ""bring together"" the experience for myself and the rest of my group. It just so happened, the recent iconic houses conference brought me back for a second visit, and I'm sure glad it did... what a difference experience! lt certainly left me feeling compelled to come on here and leave this review because we got that experience we were originally looking for! As we were perusing the house... We ran into one of the house docents,Harry, and all I can say is that this guy was just simply phenomenal...We couldn't have been more blown away with the knowledge we all walked away with, what a difference from our original private tour! All in all, I STRONGLY recommend visiting this place, just make sure you get the right docent....like we did our second time around, and you'll be left with quite a memorable experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lyttle24
50,Wonderful Afternoon Experience,"Viewing the Hollyhock House is a very uplifting experience as we visit the design of Frank Lloyd Wright. Each room is a special event as you immerse yourself in the effect of lighting, color, texture, indoors and outdoors. The tour with docents is well worth the few dollars admission, as you learn the history of the period, and especially learn about Miss Barnsdall and her father.The Hollyhock House is located on Olive Hall in Barnsdall Park, which also is the home of the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery, which has free admission.

40,Stunning,"This was a return visit to Frank Lloyd Wright's Hollyhock house in Barnsdall Park near Hollywood and Vermont. Six years ago (pre-renovation), the house was gorgeous, but it was worn around the edges. That has been restored and the house is beautiful with fresh paint and new carpeting in keeping with Wright's design. My wife and I are glad that we took the earlier tour as now there is very limited access to the house. The second floor rooms and terraces are off limits we were told because they are no ADA accessible. Six years ago you could walk through rooms, they are now roped off and viewing is through the doorways. The terraces and amphitheater also are off limits. We took the self guided tour, but there were plenty of pleasant and knowledgeable docents. We compared notes on various FLW homes we had visited. If more of the house is ever open, we would make a return visit.Trip tip: we took the Red Line from downtown, getting of at the Vermont and Sunset stop. Google maps has you walk down to Hollywood and go in the main entrance to the park. There is a shortcut off Maubert. Walk west on Maubert and you will find a staircase leading up the Hollyhock House and other park buildings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/332ThomasS
50,One of Frank Lloyd Wright's masterpieces,Took a docent guided tour of this gem on top of a hill in Hollywood. It's in Barnsdall Park at (roughly) Hollywood and Vermont. Excellent example of FLR at his best...beautiful sight lines and his quirky take on deco.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackcU1411RE
40,Worthwhile visit for Frank Lloyd Wright fans,"Hollyhock House is a Frank Lloyd Wright house located on a hill in Los Angeles with terrific views of Los Angeles, the Hollywood sign and the Griffith Observatory.The house incorporates many of Wright's familiar design attributes, and is most notable for its hollyhock design motif, which is repeated throughout the property (as well as on surrounding modern buildings and even lamp posts), and its resemblance to a Mayan temple or other pre-Columbian structure.The experience of visiting the house does leave something to be desired. There is a $7 entrance fee for a self-guided tour at a bare-bones visitor center that is little more than a desk. The good news is that you can spend as much time as you want in the house. The bad news is that there are only three rooms you can walk in and three more you can look into. Although there are guidebooks available and friendly and knowledgeable docents in the house, substantial knowledge of Frank Lloyd Wright and his design elements is assumed, and visitors without such knowledge are not likely to get much out of a visit.Also annoying is a requirement that visitors wear protective booties and warnings to NOT TOUCH ANYTHING. While I understand that the property is historic, it has also been renovated and repurposed repeatedly since it was built, and most of the furnishings are also reproductions, not originals, so the emphasis on keeping the property hands-off to visitors seems more than a bit over-the-top under the circumstances.Overall, though, if you are a fan of Frank Lloyd Wright houses and in the Los Angeles area, this house is worth seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brend482
50,Outstanding!,"The Hollyhock House recently underwent a massive restoration, and the results are spectacular! I've visited many FLW sites, but this style is unique to California. You'll certainly appreciate it if you are a fan, but it's well worth a visit even if you're just discovering FLW-in large part because of the wonderful docents. They are extremely well trained and knowledgable, and really contribute to the experience. Go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marftrip
50,A Masterpiece,"Frank Lloyd Wright was a genius as were his subordinates, who played a large part in the making of Hollyhock House. There is a short docent led tour of the grounds which included a lot of the history of the house and its eccentric owner, Alice Barnsdall. The house itself has a few rooms open to the public and some rooms that are viewable. There are docents available in the house to help guests understand what they are seeing.Only thing missing is a gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndieP538
50,This is a FABULOUS Wright house started in 1915 and recently renovated and opened to the public,"What a story this house has to tell - Aline Barnsdall had Frank Lloyd Wright design this house for her - her favorite flower being the Hollyhock. Wright designed his hollyhock which is featured in many places in the home in various iterations - stone, wood (chairs). Wright then went off to do the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, Japan, and Aline Barnsdall got fed up with the house not getting finished. The house was begun in 1915 but not finished until 1921. Del, our guide, was terrific and could give us so much information because she has been involved with the ""not for profit"" group for many years. Don't miss this great site with beautiful views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/westchicago

30,Limited Access Tour,"The Skinny:Parking: free paved lot at bottom and up topPrice: $7 - credit card onlyTime: less than 30minNote: no photographsI was very excited to see the restored Frank Lloyd Wright house in Barnsdall Art Park. The parking lot was full when we got there but it was for a croquet event that was happening there. They had a docent led tour at 1115am but we chose to not do that and go in and see the house. When you go up the ramp to the entrance they stop you to put booties on to protect the floors and carpet. Heads up, they reuse the booties for other guests so the later you get there.... They give you a speech: no food, no drinks, no photographs, no touching the walls. When you step in, there are docents in the three areas of the house that you can see. It takes about 20minutes to look at these three areas because there is no access to 2/3 of the house which was kind of a shock and very disappointing. They should only charge $3 for what you can see. What you do see is pretty amazing from an architecture stand point.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melobeam
40,"Hollyhocks are abstract version, book tour early for wine tasting nights","My sister and I have visited a lot of Frank Lloyd Wright buildings, so when I saw the Hollyhock House in L.A. was available for tours I was very excited. My husband and I came here our first night in L.A. for a wine tasting. Unfortunately, I waited too long to book the tour (available during the wine tasting and on certain days) so we only got to see the outside and what you could see from the outside of inside the house. My advice is if you want to tour this, don't wait to book the trip. There were food trucks set up to eat outside (3), and inside a certain area, we got a wrist band, two wine glasses and were able to sample 4 or 5 wines. Since we got there a little late, there wasn't much spots left to sit. People come early with blankets and food and set up there area. It was still nice to see what we could of this house, built for a client who later fired FLW, but the downside (for 2 adults on vacation) was there was a TON of kids running around. I guess the parents needed some adult time, but these adults needed some kid-free time, and this wasn't the place to find it. The wine tasting, with a DJ spinning tunes, seemed like a very local thing to do. With the Hollywood sign in the background and a beautiful sunset, we felt like we were really in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Glee47
40,"Great that it has been stabilized, but ...","... while the walking tour in the rooms open to the public is worth the trip, too much of the house is either not restored or restored for special purpose use. An observant visitor however can get a sense of the house's original design, but a before/after video in the garage or a decent set of pre-restoration pictures would greatly enhance the experience. It is sad to know how much of the original setting is gone or about to go (guest house), a visual reminder of the challenges in saving our architectural history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hankkacz

50,Hollyhock House - Frank Lloyd Wright designed home,"It was a treat to see a FLW designed home from almost 100 years ago. His attention to detail was amazing. You must wear foot coverings (provided) and you can only look into the dining room, music and living rooms and library. The docents provide the history of the different rooms of the house. There is also a written explanation of the rooms.The owner, Aline Barnsdall, also created an Arts Park on the property and was a very independent woman. There is a great history on the website.The location of the house is atop a hill and the view is of the Hollywood sign and the Griffith Observatory.A very enjoyable afternoon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancy405
50,Great restored (partially) FLW house,"If you like FLW, you have to check it out. Even though he got fired (for cost overruns... Surprise) the place was finished and then restored to his standards. You get to see a portion of the house, and nothing upstairs at this point. The living room to perfect. Dinning room as well. The docents were very knowledgeable and very interested in discussion and passed along great information. Outside, the space is bounded by a chain linked fence.... Limits the full feeling of what the outside feels like. Guess the area at night is not the best. Worth the $7. Parking is free (yes, in LA).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveB749
50,Hidden gem,"Although we have lived in the LA area for years, it took visitors from out of town to get us to Frank Lloyd Wright's fantastic Hollyhock House. The house has recently been partially refurbished and has an amazing 360 degree view. It isn't necessary to be a Wright fan to enjoy a visit here. We booked a tour with a docent and Harry was outstanding. We will definitely return. There are not restroom facilities and access is somewhat difficult.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/siddog
20,Ok for a quick stop,"The house is nice, but you don't get to see much of anything on the tour. There are more signs warning you about the long-term consequences of touching a wall or anything-even unintentionally, then there is about the house. There are informational books you can read while touring, but the books is all text. It would have been nice to see photos in the book too so you could be sure you were reading about the right thing. Nearly all the furniture is a replica and a few rooms are barely furnished so I don't understand why they won't let you walk farther in. Down one hallway, you can see that there are beautiful wooden models of the home, but you aren't permitted in that room. Those, and a floorplan of the house would be nice inclusions in the tour.If you go, expect to see fantastic views of the Hollywood Sign, expect to see loads of homeless people wandering around, and expect to only spend 20-30 minutes in the house. It's just too small to stay longer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stumpre1
40,show me more!!,"the home is amazing, the docents are extremely well prepared and enthusiastic about the property, but the 'walk wright in' self guided tour only shows a tiny fraction of the home, essentially only what has been 'completely' restored, but so much of the beauty of the home, the glass details in the bedrooms and the flow from space to space is killed by the truncated access, I was able to tour privately in early 2000's and while it was terribly sad to see the condition of the home at the time, it was still breathtaking since we were able to access every square foot of the space as if we lived there, still worth a visit if in the area, but not yet perfect",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pyite81

40,It's Worth The Wait,"Years ago, it took me hours to walk to this destination, only to find out that it's closed for renovation. I would never have fathomed that Hollyhock House would cross my path again a week ago when my friends took me here as a ""surprise"". After USD$23 million of renovation, the lucky ones are able to witness the greatness of Frank Lloyd Wright's vision. For those of you that are familiar with Japanese architecture, you would have noted that he borrowed a few ideas from that culture that he admired immensely: indoor-outdoor flow, borrowed light, framed view. Only a portion of Hollyhock House is being renovated and the basement may never be available to the public due to the Disability Act which stated that what's not available to the disabled people shall also not be made available to able people. Yes, the link fence around the building is an eye-sore but what option does the place have? It's all about achieving a function and to stay within a given budget. I think the Trust is doing the best within its parameters to fulfill its briefs. Hollyhock House is surely worth a visit. It is apparent that the Park is also popular with Angelos. People were sunbathing, running around with their pets, kids, and spending quality time together. Overall, commendable visit. By the way, the guides there are amazing. It's best to do Q & A sessions with them. They are a wealth of information.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wiredfrog

50,Great example of Wright architecture,"We found Hollyhock House and the park to be beautiful! The views over the city and Hollywood Hills were amazing and it was nice to see people picnicking and enjoying the grounds. The interior of the house was well maintained and it is obvious a lot of work has been done to help keep it that way. There were several docents throughout the main floor, which is all that is for viewing, and they were all friendly and shared so much about the home, the architect and the original owner as well as the on going conservancy plans. There is a chain link fence around the house to protect the empty pool area etc. from further damage until work can be done on these areas. We try to see FLW homes on our travels and this one is a gem!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dharma2015
50,Love Frank Lloyd Wright Houses!,Had a nice visit to hollyhock house in east Hollywood and loved walking around the beautiful property and looking at the views of the Hollywood hills. Inside the house you can do a self guided tour. The cost was around $15 but it is worth it if you like architecture. Enjoy your visit!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philip2010
40,A beautiful piece of architecture not shown in the best light.,"The design and layout of the house with its landscaped pools is outstanding. The cast concrete decorative features near the roofline are very distinctive. The only fully furnished room - the living room - is one of the most beautiful rooms I have seen. The custom furniture, fireplace and windows are so wonderfully integrated. It is surely worth the trip to visit the Barnsdall Art Park .The Park is very difficult to find, and the interior signage is inadequate. You have to search for the entrance. The property is shared by several facilities and the exterior views of theHouse has suffered because of this. The ugly 8 foot high chain link fence which surrounds the House on 3 sides is set so close its destroys the innate grandeur of the structure and spoils the beauty of the pools and landscaping. I realize protecting the House from vandals, etc. is important, but the fence is badly located and ugly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arewethereyet844
30,Underwhelming!,"I gave this destination a rating of ‘average’ for several reasons.First, although the house seems to have been well restored, the ‘self guided’ tour is limited to standing in the main foyer and hallway and peering into the living room, dining room, another unfinished room and down a hallway. That’s it. Frankly, the living room from the Lloyd Wright Little House from Wayzata MN, installed in its entirety at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, is a more interesting experience and about as inclusive. If you look at everything and use the good visitors’ guide, you will be done in less than half an hour. You cannot walk around the outside of the house as an unsightly chain-link fence keeps you away (and because everyone wants to do that, there is a well worn dirt track around the fence - you would think they could install a sidewalk!).Second, the park in which the house is located is a bit run down. I am sure it is a challenge to secure enough funding to maintain the multitude of sites that the City of Los Angeles owns, but really. The Museum of Art located there has limited hours and that, as well as the Art Park are showing their age since they were completed in 1971.Lloyd-Wright designed and built three houses at Hollyhock; the main house, now nicely restored, and two other residences, one of which was demolished in the 1950's. The other, described as ‘Residence A’ sits at a bend in the entrance road, rotting into the ground. So much for historic preservation. I know that Lloyd-Wrights houses are notoriously difficult and expensive to maintain because of their design and construction, but if you own one, I think you are duty-bound to keep it up, not let it rot.Although a minor inconvenience to us as we arrived early, parking is very limited and I wondered what people do when there is a performance at the Theater or any other event drawing more than a small number of visitors.The ‘Visitors Center’ is located in the building that was formerly the garage of the house. It is efficient, but is hardly a real ‘visitor’s center’ as it has only a few photos of the house on the walls and is nothing more than an admission desk.Don’t get me wrong, we enjoyed our visit to Hollyhock House, but it falls far short of being a sterling attraction. Take a picnic lunch and enjoy the view!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rexflash
50,Historic House,"The Hollyhock house has reopened after a 4 million dollar renovation. There are self guided tours offered Thursday through Sunday. $7 adults $3 seniors. The house was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Construction started in 1919. Frank Lloyd Wright was fired when the house went way over budget and there were construction problems. The house was completed in 1922. They only let a small number of people in at any time. You wear shoe coverings. You observe the rooms from the entry and hall ways. You do get a good view of the living room, dining room and library. The kitchen is behind the dining room. The view of the kitchen is very limited. There were docents which were happy to answer your question. This is pretty much like a real guided tour. You can go around the outside but there is a chain link fence about 30 feet all around the house. There is no photography in the house. The parking is limited in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charles6346

Aline Barnsdall, the donor of Barnsdall Art Park is the woman that made possible this unique coastal home designed by Mr.Wright. It is not just a building; it is a story about two energetic, creative, and strong personalities that made possible for us today to delight ourselves with so much beauty and originality!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dresthercita
40,"Great house, not so great visit","The latest restoration of Hollyhock house is magnificent, but the visiting experience is less than satisfying. Instead of docent-led walking tours through the ground floor, upstairs and downstairs rooms and the garden/patio areas, the visitor is (in contrast to dozens of other Wright houses around the country) restricted to standing in the foyer and looking a ground-floor rooms from behind rope barriers (albeit aided by some very nice, enthusiastic and knowledgeable docents). The culprits in this case are the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) and the L.A. City Council (Hollyhock house being a city-owned building). Since there is no wheel-chair access beyond the foyers, the ADA kicks in; and the City Council, so I’m told, won’t invoke the “house museum” exemption. The premise seems to be a malevolent one attributed to people with disabilities: “If I can’t get around the house, then I don’t want others to enjoy it either”—not a psychology that lovers of Wright are likely to have. The result of all these restrictions is that one feels a bit on the outside looking in. Wright designed his homes to be lived in, with spaces to move through and be encompassed by. The great joy of visiting those homes open to the public is that one gets the feeling of living in a Frank Lloyd Wright world. Unfortunately, the current situation is somewhat like a sterile, museum experience. Let us hope that the City Council will relent and return the experience to what it was before this latest restoration.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Berwanger
40,Remarkable Historic Site - Unfortunately Needs More Funding,"A visit the Hollyhock House is fabulous for so many reasons. First, of course, anyone who appreciates architecture, especially Frank Lloyd Wright, will marvel at how innovative design impacts appearance and functionality throughout the house --- rooms, furniture, carpeting, landscaping -- all purposefully constructed. Very reflective of the genius at work. It's so right (re: Wright - pun intended!). The house is situated on a hill and you get views on the grounds, and can peer directly at those famous icons - the Hollywood sign and Griffin Observatory. It looked like a number of folks were really just enjoying the grounds, and that works too.Unfortunately, as a city park, the Hollyhock House has not really received the cash needed to ""bring it back."" For example, we were only allowed to tour maybe half the house. The city also put an oversized paved parking lot right next to the house, and the garage serves as a sorry looking ticket office.There are some historic regrets as well. Apparently Alice Barnsdall, who commissioned the work, had issues with Wright, and there aren't many photographs to help the historians restore the various alternations made over time. Still, it's a great spot to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Balto-Rob
50,Extraordinary Exemplar of Frank Lloyd Wright Architecture,"Recently re-opened exemplar of unique Frank Lloyd Wright West Coast style.

50,Be sure and see the inside,"We were really lucky to be visiting when tours were offered. In June construction began to restore the porch and, when we were there in October, tours were available Friday - Sunday (usually Wednesday-Sundays). There are lots of areas that need renovation so be sure and check schedules -----. Also ask if the documentary about the structural work done to make the house more earthquake resistant showing the meticulous restoration of the outside concrete is available for viewing. We were early for our tour and the only ones watching in a multi-use area so I am not sure it's always available, but well worth the time. Another possibility: watch it on the internet (find the link in Wikepedia's ""Hollyhock House""). It's a great introduction to the house! Hollyhock House is on the top of a hill shared with a small theater and a Municipal Art Gallery. The whole area is lovely with nice views and the exterior of the house is very decorative. However, the interior (which you can only see with a tour) is what makes this a top attraction. Hollyhock House is not like Falling Water (either in design or state of preservation). Wright was working on the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo during much of the construction and project supervision was left to his apprentice Rudolph Schindler and his son, Lloyd Wright. The house was given to the City of Los Angeles in 1927 and for many years was leased by art and cultural groups which adapted the space for their use. In the '70's a major rehabilitation restored much of the house's original appearance, but it's a difficult house to maintain and lack of money is evident. Nevertheless, it is well worth seeing! Our docent was excellent - a very enjoyable afternoon. If you are interested in architecture, Richard Neutra's VDL II house is near-by. I think those tours are available only on Saturday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NewYorkAnne

Can't tell you how many times we drove by here and never realized this park was here. Some guys hanging out playing guitar, students reading, a little Frisbee ... just perfect. Panoramic views of Griffith Observatory, downtown, the Hollywood Sign...you name it. The house itself has undergone recent renovations, and unfortunately we just missed the last tour of the House, but will definitely return to see next visit. Husband had fun playing pickup guitar with some of the guys. Wonderful place to relax and terrific photo ops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathyboy
30,"park OK, exterior of Hollyhock House was kind of sad","We only toured the outside of the house, but it was in pretty sad shape. The landscaping in the park was nice, and the views are great, almost 360 degrees. The best views are of the Griffith Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/micchio
40,Architectural gem with great views,"This is a classic Art Deco masterpiece, I am glad I saw it before it falls into even worse disrepair. Kudos to the people trying to keep the building going but the concrete is wearing sadly. It is still a beauty to see and the inside tour is worth the time. The views of the Hollywood hills from the park (which is free) were every bit as good as the much-pushed view from the Hollywood & Highland shopping center and you don't have to jostle with 1000 tourists for the same photo. You can also see LA downtown from the other side of the park if you walk around the visitor center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BadgerCT
