50,Best Bowling Alley in LA,"If I do not want to go to downtown LA to go bowling, this is the BEST alley to go to. There is a pro shop that I frequent and the alley is always filled with league bowlers and avid bowlers like me. The staff is always accommodating and very friendly.If i had the choice, this is my HOME court any day, any time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kenskef
50,Great New Year's Eve Location!,"We were in the area for the Rose Bowl and chose to gather with other football fans for bowling on New Year's Eve at this location. They had an unlimited buffet and bowling (including shoes) from 9pm-1am, including a champagne or cider toast at midnight as well as party noisemakers. All of this for under $40/person. (Not sure if there were reduced rates for children.) The staff was over the top friendly and went out of their way to make sure we had a great experience. The reservation process via the website was easy and follow-up from the bowling alley in advance was much more than I expected. The bowling alley was clean and in a nice location. The other guests there that night were fun and respectful - some adult only groups and some family groups. They have an excellent selection of bowling balls much more easily marked than I have ever seen at a bowling alley. The food was basic bowling alley food (pizza, chicken tenders, nachos, cookies, brownies, plus something I'm forgetting - egg rolls?). I only had the pizza and it was good. My husband said the chicken tenders were really good. We would definitely come back here the next time our team makes the Rose Bowl! (A word of advice: If you're taking a taxi here from Pasadena, definitely go with Uber. It was half the price of a traditional taxi.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SueZet80
