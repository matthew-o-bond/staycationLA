10,Don’t waste your time,"We purchased an L.A. go card and thought the K1 speed would be a great option to use it on.The track is tiny, the staff just seem like they can’t really be bothered to be there/help and you’re on the track for literally minutes.We drove almost an hour and it was honestly a complete waste of time and an LA go pass. I’d save yourself some time and money and use it on one of the other amazing attractions, as this really is nothing but a let down.",Nicola
10,LA Go Pass Holders!!,"We are in town for vacation and bought the LA Go Pass and decided to use it for K1 Speed because we had heard good things and it was relatively close to the Queen Mary. (We want to do as much as possible in the time we are here.) We arrived at 5:30 and were told it would be about an hour wait, they were busy, no big deal. 7:18 rolls around and we still weren't called to race. We went up to the stand only to discover our names were never put on the roster to race. This was infuriating because we had checked in with the stand more than once to make sure we didn't miss our call. Incredibly poor customer service and valuable time wasted tonight. Many pass holders seem to have this issue...",LoveTravel334655
10,Long waits,"We were told to just turn up. Had Go card. Arrived, place looks food - but 40 mins queue to then be told 2.5 hours wait for the go ... really not worth it. Staff not helpful and a pain as we had driven a fair distance for this. Not worth it at all.",DLS
50,"excellent experience , adult go karts !","This place is amazing never fails to get my adrenaline going, please don’t bring your kids here that sit inside and play video games then write poor 1 star reviews because your kids got scared , or bumped , and don’t understand what a competitive sport is . This place is hands down amazing the carts are fast and really aren’t for little kids , don’t bring dozens of little kids here for this it’s not a place for little kids honestly , I don’t even know why they allow children to race here , if you’re 14 and older then I would say this place is perfect for you And if you’re into adrenaline pumping extreme sports then this is for you! Sorry about my post I was reading other reviews and it’s ridiculous how people are giving one star because there kids got bumped or got whiplash for going 5mph , what do u expect , don’t bag on a place for giving a full experience ... they offer a full amazing experience highly recommended for those who love extreme sports, not for couch potatoes lol",Locdogluke
40,"great for kids, but little hectic","my son and his friend were hear last summer, they enjoyed it, but the whole experience was little hectic, probably that is the point :)",Douglas William M
40,Fun go karting experience,"The electric go carts are amazing. You get a head sock to put on before your helmet. After strapped in with a full harness, you are ready to go fast. Progressively more challenging curves and turns make the experience fun. Plus no engine exhaust to inhale !!!",Russ M
10,Horrible safety and complete lack of concern for well being of customer,"Wow what a disappointment! I took my kids to K1 Speed in Gardena in August right before school started. It was our first time and the kids were very excited. When we got there I learned that there was two options, one for kids and one for adults. Great. My oldest daughter was qualified to be in an adult car and my son was right on the boarder. My youngest daughter was definitely in the kids race. My oldest girl was a bit afraid so she asked the track manager if she could ride in the kids race and drive slow and just enjoy herself. He told she could. My son was told it was safer to drive in the kids race. Great again.I watched as the adults ahead of us were getting ready for the race and I listened to the safety speech. They explained the flags and signs and told everyone that they should move over if someone wants to pass. I watched as they held up safety flags and signs, told people not to bump and reminded them to let others pass. This was great. It was finally time for my kids to race and then things got bad.The track workers gave a safety speech but only to my kids. I asked about the other kids and I was told that they had already heard the speech in a previous race. The race starts and already I could tell there was one kid who really wanted to win. He was hugging the corners on the turns and driving close behind other cars. He finally was behind my youngest daughter and and was frustrated that the track was tight in that spot and could not pass. Finally he bumped my daughter pretty hard but she was OK. No warning flag no sign. I looked at the track worker and he was busy talking to someone with no flag in his hand. This kid went around the track again, ended up behind my youngest daughter again and this time bumped her so hard that she had to raise her hand to stop the race. I was scared she got hurt but then learned that the hit had caused her hood and helmet to fall over her eyes but she was not hurt. Once again no warning was issued to this boy. The race started again and this same boy came up behind my son and bumped him several time but did this not bother my son. But guess what? No flag, no sign and no warning. The race continued and now this boy had lapped my oldest daughter who was intentionally driving slow and was told by the track manager that it was OK to do so. This boy came up behind my oldest daughter and began bumping her several times lightly with no warning being issued. He then slowed down, let some space develop between him and my daughter then rammed her car very hard. She stopped the car and was crying from neck pain. They gave her ice but again did nothing about this crazy kid. After the race was over I asked the track manager why he did not issue a warning to this boy. His response, ""do you think I should have?"" My answer ""yes"" He said ""Ok I guess I will go talk to his dad if you really think I should. I said ""yes."" I then took my daughter to the ER where she was diagnosed with Whiplash and I was presented with a $300 bill. I know I signed a release but that release should also apply to the employees of K1 speed following their own rules, which they did not. I have tried multiple times to reach a supervisor at the Irvine location listed as the corporate offices. My calls have all been ignored and when I have asked for the contact information of the District Manager I have been told they are not allowed to give that information out. I guess they just don't care about customer service or the well being of their patrons. Too bad and shame on them . I will never go there again and start to spread my story over social media. It is really too bad that a company like this is run in such an unhealthy way.",KRCHollyglen_CA

50,Shockingly Fun! All Electric Thrill Ride!,"I was introduced to K1 Speed by my college aged daughter back home from the East Coast for break. She told me how much fun she had at the K1 Speed near school in Boston. I am a big believer in electric vehicles, so a chance to drive one on a formula-like track sounded fun.It was wonderful! The cars accelerate really fast and the track was a fun challenge. The race was exciting and I was not nearly as fast as those drivers who clearly had much more experience than I did. But that did not detract from the exhilaration and joy I felt attempting this new experience. I am excited about returning.I love that the cars do not emit any exhaust gases and it was really wonderful to try racing indoors, especially because it was a rainy day.The only slightly negative part of the adventure was it took almost an hour of waiting before it was our turn to race. I would have preferred a 15 minute (or less) wait time.Truly a great experience.",EKC_LA_CA
50,"Fast Karts, great time.",Great staff. Nice track & karts. Costs about $20 for a session (about 12 laps). You have to pay for membership which is an additional $9 and comes with a head wrap & helmet use. We went here using the LA Go Pass and enjoyed our laps.,Tanmansmom
40,High speed excitement,"The karts ran at fast speed and the rules were simple yet structured. If you're looking for excitement, high speed, and safety, I highly recommend K1 Speed Torrance. The price is approximately fifty dollars per ride which includes an estimate of 14 laps per person. Finally, the attraction is indoors and offers some snacks.",Carmen J
50,Great Karting Experience,"Best experience I've had at Go Karts. Everyone from the staff at the front desk to the track marshals and managers were welcoming, friendly and helpful.The karts are fast and fun - after your first race. I found out that for your first race, the karts are slightly handicapped so that you have a chance to familiarize yourself with the track and the kart. They should make that clear somewhere, because this could make for a bad first experience, if you are constantly being passed and flagged to let other cars pass, always thinking that you're doing something wrong. Other than this, it was am awesome experience, just don't get discouraged after your very first race.If they think you are holding up someone else, they will slow you down to let them pass. This is good when you have a mix of people, but doesn't allow for real wheel to wheel racing. If you're going with a group of people, you might want to let the marshals know that you don't want easy passes and that you'll work for them?? Worth a shot!And for everyone scoffing at the thought of electric Go Karts, give it a try - they have enough torque to give you overseer out of every corner, and glue you to your seat on acceleration. They are on par, if not better than some gas powered karts I've raced.",Purazar B
10,Awful,"Awful place, with very strange rules. On Oct 27, 2013, in the last race for the day, we were 8 racers, everybody drove fast but fair (not bumping, not hitting each other). The employee requested that I let another driver pass me by and I saw the sign while I was in the fastest section of the track. So, there was no time to act upon his sign, it was impossible to let the other driver pass me by right away, especially while taking the turn where everybody drives with their highest speed than any other area of the racing track. I don't mind letting anybody pass me by, but not on the highest speed portion of the racing track or on the next 70 degrees sharp turn!!! As a result, he slowed down my car. That happened twice, which is not fair and totally uncalled for. I was very frustrated... well can you blame me?!?!?! To slow me down in order to let anybody else pass me by - what bogus rule is that?! It is called ""speed racing"" for a reason, not ""don't speed up or we'll slow you down"" racing. I've been recommending that place to so many people and this is what I got in return!!! No appreciation for their loyal customers. I think they should reimburse me for that.",k m
40,Can't wait to return,"Karts are so fast great speed, so much better than back home. Games are fab but could be so much quicker, still can't complain, we will be back again soon... Fantastic keep up the good work Eddie see you soon .xx",Ravi K
50,well worth it for my 15 year old,"my husband and 15 year old drove three races. The times and places are all computerized and you get a printout of your performance. This seems like a safe place and well run. The staff was very nice and one of the guys went out of our way to find something my son lost. Located in a commercial park. I'd go during the weekday if on vacation. It wasn't too crowded. Also, very clean facilities and the equipment was clean.",reeel-deezinuh
20,Preferential Treatment and Poor Customer Service,"I took my twin 16 year old girls to the Torrence K1 Speed facility for some family fun. I had never been to any of the K1 Speed facilities but I had been to the M2B Cart facility in Sylmar once. The two facilities are very similar and in fact may be owned by the same parent company. We purchased three 14 lap races. During the first race there was a spin-out which I'm sure is common place where they have the ability to shut all of the cars down remotely via a handheld computer/transmitter. The odd thing I noticed was while everybody else was shut down one individuals cart was still able to move. He continued to move around the track while the rest of us were stopped. Later when the race ended I noticed that my daughter only got to run 10 laps of the 14 lap race. When I asked why, Nick, the manager told me it was because the leader must have lapped her 4 times which then brought the race to an end. I understood why this rule is in place however then I learned that the person that lapped her was the same guy who's cart was allowed to keep running while ours was shut down. Then after questioning Nick again I found out this guy is a friend and frequent racer there. It was very obvious that Nick was allowing certain friends to run their race at the expense of other paying customers. The attitude I got from Nick was, ""Oh well, that's the way it is"". He even got a bit snotty with me by saying, ""haven't you ever watched NASCAR?"" Here is my point, I understand there will always be people who are faster and will move around the track and pass others. I also understand that not everybody will get the full 14 laps they paid for because of the faster people. I have a problem when the managament knows these ""faster"" racers are out there and assists them by not shutting down their carts. I assume the staff of these facilities are experts and knows most of the regulars. I would think then they would arrange the carts to let the novice drivers out for at least one full lap before letting these other ""pros"" out of the bullpen. I would not recommend this facility to any corporate or family customers.",pdqfiero
