40,Good for the Sports Bar,"As a casino, this just wasn't to our taste. All cash games, no slots, blackjack, etc. Parimutuel room had an entry fee, and looked kind of sad. Instead, we decided to enjoy the sports bar where we watched the NFL playoff games. Fun atmosphere with boisterous fans at the bar and at tables - It was great to engage with other patrons. Appetizers and entrees are consistent with standard bar food. Drinks were good, and service from Arnaldo F was superior (friendly and efficient). Prices were very reasonable. I'd go back to watch games/eat/drink, but not to gamble.",IraBfromCSG
40,Good Texas Hold Em Action,Beautiful decor. Plenty of cash games and seats available. (2) daily tournaments on weekdays and (3) on weekends. Did not order food but it looked amazing and the portions looked big.,jms574
50,Nice spot of lunch before a Rock Show at the Forum,"First visit to the Hollywood park casino, very nice venue, easy parking and easy to find.Had a lovey spot of lunch in the bar/grill whilst watching some American Football on a bank of massive TVs.Food was nice, good choice menu lots to pick from and a excellent choice of beers.Worth a trip if you like a flutter or a meal and a few beers.Neil",Neil E
50,Great for special events,"First review but felt compelled! My group of 10 had a special event at Hollywood Park Casino. The space was beautiful and there are several smaller rooms that offer a bit more intimacy. Everything is brand new and clean. Bathrooms are lovely. The workers were very friendly and professional, and Jessica our event specialist was incredibly accommodating. Thank you HPC! We'll host our next event with you guys soon!",Producergal
40,Hollywood Park Casino,"Not impressed with the ""Pay to Play"" at the Casino. Looks fantastic from the outside but would not recommend this Casino. They have a charge for just about everything but using the Restrooms.",Maggie T
10,Less fun than a trip to the dentist,"The place is new. No smoking inside. Unfortunately there's a charge for every hand played at house card games, (not texas holdem against other players). A charge for all drinks while playing,(unlike Las Vegas). The dealers I encountered were cold as a penguin. There is a ""banker"" of some sort that sits next to the dealer. It feels like big brother watching. It is an efficient but un-entertaining way to part with money. Horse racing similcastung. No video gaming.",Bradley W
10,No Slots???,"No slots? LOL. This ""casino"" gives a new name to casino...lol...what a waste of space. Stay away. This place will make you disappointed once you enter the space. Take the time to drive to a real casino such as Pechanga...You will appreciate it.",imuscle66
10,Worst Casino I’ve ever visited,"We walked into a beautiful looking, posh casino excited to play. Within minutes of sitting down we realized it was a “pay to play” , $1 for every had (this adds up quickly and they already have house advantage.). The dealers and “banker” sitting at your table do not speak to you, but do speak to each other (frequently in Chinese). Everyone eyeballs you like a criminal the entire time and makes you feel i comfortable as you lose your money and pay to pay. We have gambled all over the US and out of the country. I will never set foot in here again and suggest you do not either.",go_state
40,First time since remodel,Played some cash and liked the new tables with the slots you can put your cards in. Room was run decent and the players were cool. Food was better than average and will for sure be back.,Tina Las Vegas
40,Hollywood Park Casino Restaurant,"This location is in Inglewood California and is a very good place to eat. Parking is free and there is plenty. It is handicap friendly. After parking we walked to the elevator, which was quick, and landed on the ground level where we proceeded to the Casino. We discovered that we must enter into the front of the Casino for the restaurant. It is nice size, clean, booths, tables and TV; the décor is comfortable and refreshing; the wait-staff is prompt and ready to serve you. They are very pleasant and make you feel as though they've been waiting for you.The menu has something for everyone though not extensive. They do not rush you to make a selection. Once ordered your meal is served in a reasonable period of time and it's just as it should be, hot and delicious (if you ordered a hot meal). My wife and I will go there again and will probably plan to have a small gathering of friends and neighbors there. The Casino also has a Conference Room. The attire is casual but you may dress as you so desire. Of course, the Gaming Tables are in the same building and is available as you choose. Try the restaurant for yourself. Enjoy!",RichardO70
10,GONE TOO,"With the Track, this noisy crazy hospitable place is GONE. I won't miss the really ridiculous parking lot, but the service at the Fund Raiser for our high school will be missed.",Anaheim_Marilyn
10,No slots! Just tables,"Looked like a casino, we walked in and expected another room where the slots might be but there were know?? Never saw anything like this,, you have to pay to park as well???",Marlene P
10,Bad Customer Service,We stopped here to have a beer and check out the table games since we were from Las Vegas. We sat at the bar and waited for more than 10 minutes while the bartender ignored us. It wasn't busy so that's no excuse. On his 4th venture to our end of the bar my husband stood up and said excuse me with a wave of his hand and he acted like he didn't hear him and returned to the other end of the bar. We chose to take our business elsewhere and won't be back.,Debbie H
30,Food service in need of overhaul.,Brand new casino. Good games. Been here several times since the move.Quality of food and presentation leaves a lot to be desired. Not nearly up to par with other card clubs in the area.Food appears to be hastily prepared with low quality ingredients and unattractively presented.,Mpclaw
