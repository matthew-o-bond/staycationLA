50,You don't have to buy,"Two Rodeo Drive is a sort of alley with very high end shops. You can look, but don't feel obligated to buy. Some shops have affordable items, others cater to millionaires. Most people in Beverly Hills are friendly, don't feel intimidated by he high prices..",Jeffry b

40,Probably the Prettiest Pedestrian Street in Beverly Hills,"Pedestrian street extending from Rodeo Drive to Wilshire Blvd across from the Beverly Wilshire Hotel (notably the hotel depicted in ""Pretty Woman""). Two Rodeo is just about one-half block of very nice stores on a curved walking path. We took this short walk to 208 Rodeo restaurant. If you happen to be in the area, take this little stretch of pedestrian walkway and stop to see merchandise offered in the stores or you may see a celebrity. Otherwise, this is not a destination trip while visiting L.A., Beverly Hills or Rodeo Drive.Recommended for anyone who has already seen most of the great attractions in the L.A. area. Most tourists seem to take photos standing on steps next to the fountain with colorful flowers in the spring or summer months. During the holidays, the decorations with Santa, sleigh and reindeer and the tall wooden soldiers are nice for photo ops.",RikiUSA

There are no name brands, but if you absolutely must have a giant diamond but find yourself away from the casino gift shop you usually shop at, and you have never heard of nearby stores like David Webb, Van Cleef & Arpels, or Cartier, it must be reassuring to have this mall available.",traveler2542b

50,European feel in Beverly hills.,"I have a fondness for this place. You walk up a little cobbled side street with a sharp gradient.Very Italy. At the top right there is a good fish restaurant,which is not too expensive for the location. Sulkas and Tiffanies are there...what's not to like? You can walk off your lunch with meandering strolls thru Hermes, Ferragamo, Bally and of course Ralf Lauren. Don't forget your free perfume sprays at each store,then drop the scent blotters in your underpinnings drawers.Its an iconic experience.I took my dog into R. L's on a tip that they had a doggie clothes sale. I tried a sweater on her. She obligingly turned circles,paused and then resumed the circles. She caused a delighted commotion and the store gave me a huge discount on the luxe dog sweater.This works for me!! They even offered me the little toy prop dog,my pooch was trying to make off with after her runway performance. What fun!",mark +alexi k
20,Plastic,What's the fuss with rodeo drive shopping? Antiquated in my opinion and feels like an empty movie studio out of actors . Barely a soul around empty stores and poor selection,Missytikal

50,A little piece of Europe In BH,"short stroll up a very pretty street , its worth a look as it won't take long _ unless you are shopping",Margaret B
10,Not the Italian shopaholic haven,"It's pretty. It's cute. It's clean. Really really super clean. And you feel like a movie star(let) from the moment you park the car with valet service for free for two hours (and it's a tiny street so you do see that - and rodeo drive - in less.Coming from Italy where, especially in Milan, shopping is an art, I can definitely say that the shops both in this complex and rodeo drive are very nice, but shopping per se - for me - is not an option. However, strolling down the pretty stairs, stroll in and out of galleries, go across the road and have a coffee at the ""pretty woman"" hotel and go in and out of the shops where you are treated so well you can't believe it - whether you are clad in diamonds or jeans is a very relaxing, nice and calm experience. And you want to go back. And back. And take the stroll over and over again. As I said I might not shop there but on my three annual Los Angeles trips,this plaza, as the whole of the rodeo drive quadrangle is always a stroll I make. (And ok, I do shop - a little! Definitely to put on agenda, including putting car in garage. And pick it up within two hours having felt very luxurious for that period of time !",Katja L
40,Exspensive,A smaller strip of stores than I expected. It is nice to go check out the famous Rodeo Drive but don't plan on buying anything unless you have plenty of money to basically throw away. Strip mall for the wealthy.,Jaqtwo

30,A nice place to stroll but not the best of luxury shopping,"If you have been to Asia, this place is nice only for a romantic stroll and maybe to reenact the movies. BUT it's definitely close to the scene in 'pretty woman' where the sales staff have their noses up in the air. Ain't about money, but respect.It didn't happen to us but we could see the distinction how they treated customers from shop to shop. I'll recommend it only for a stroll.",L.C

30,A partial oasis away from the crowds on Rodeo drive.,"Probably the best attraction is the fact that the stores are not directly on Rodeo drive but in their own enclave. The stores on Rodeo drive as well as 2 Rodeo drive are really nothing special - lots of jewelry shops - Bulgari, Harry Winston & Van Cleef on Rodeo drive proper are rather good - but they always are! As an aside: Do you remember the tiny Harry Winston store which closed some years ago in Trump Tower in Manhattan? It was like a small jewel box, The HW store in Tokyo is far more exciting than the HW in Beverly Hills.The restaurant at 2 Rodeo caters to the tourist trade. Please keep in mind that Rodeo drive is nothing like Ave Montaigne - just sitting outside of the Plaza Athene and having hot chocolate while looking at Dior is a far better experience.",jamesjseltzer
40,"It's ""part"" of Rodeo Drive","If you are on Rodeo Drive, then you'll run into it if you're anything like me and hit every corner of the area.

30,Quaint but just shops,Two rodeo drive is a small winding cobbled street near the Rodeo Drive and Wiltshire Blvd intersection. There are circa 10 shops here. It makes a pretty picture if you can find a moment without any tourists walking up and down it. However it's nothing special just a pretty shopping street. Personally i preferred walking up Rodeo drive as there is a bigger selection of shops and some fun super cars!,Travellover6128

Placed at the corner of Wilshire and Rodeo drive - god only knows how much the rent is but stores like Versace, Tiffany and others don't seem to mind. Historically, there is a greeter wearing a red Brioni tux who takes photos with tourists and gives out advice but for those in-the-know there is great shopping and good eats to be had beyond that guy. Also 2 Rodeo has great parking although there is a fee for it unlike the city structures that are free for the first hour or two.",FlyersFanInLA
