50,A must-visit for every Bruin,"This Hall of Fame gives homage to UCLA Athletics. Besides being now the Number 1 public university in the US, UCLA is also one of top universities in men's and women's sports with a total of 118 championships. The Hall covers all sports and also gives the history of the athletes who contributed to the Bruin Sports heritage. Of course, a very impressive section is devoted to Coach John Wooden and basketball, but UCLA has also dominated in other sports such as volleyball, water polo, track and field, and gymnastics. Very inspirational to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech522
40,Honoring UCLA's finest athletes,"There are several pay-to-park structures on the campus. The best for this attraction is #4 located on the north side of the campus (take the Westwood entrance off Sunset). The hall of fame has free admission and is located across the plaza from the college bookstore. The exhibits honor the various sports in which UCLA participates and has a room listing the members of the university's athletics hall of fame. If you go to UCLA for some reason (especially a sporting event) and have a little extra time, it is worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ransom007
