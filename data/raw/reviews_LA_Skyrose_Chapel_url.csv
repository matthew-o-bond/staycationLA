50,A Beautiful Place to Remember,"Each year Rose Hills offers a Memorial Day service for a large number of people on the lawn just east of the Skyrose Chapel. This service honors the memory of those who have served their country in times of danger. It is a patriotic event that is much appreciated by the veterans and the families of veterans living or deceased.Skyrose Chapel is a beautiful and inspirational building, very open, high and airy. I like to enter the chapel after the Memorial Day service, sit in a pew and remember my past and the people who were a part of my past. On a clear day the view of Los Angeles is tremendous from this hilltop sanctuary. A huge window array gives a panoramic view towards the west. This is a very nice setting for thinking and giving thanks to God for his blessings to us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/byronh891
