50,Crazy Energy!,"I stumbled across LA Live on my walk into Downtown and wow - the energy was amazing! I was there during Christmas, so having the ice skating rink and huge christmas trees was truly magical. There's many restaurants, bars and local street entertainment around",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MatchstickLive
30,It was Fun,It was so nice it is right outside the JW Marriott. My husband had a conference there over the week end so we decided to stay over night. We were glad to find so many places to eat right outside the hotel. I can't say I would go back just to go hang out there. I would go back to go to a event . We went to Lucky Strike bowling alley. You can read my review for there if you like. and the JW Marriott,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/939beverlyk

30,Mostly OverPriced Chains,"Almost nothing that we haven't seen before in a tourist destination. THe only unique place was Shaquille's restaurant, which was very stuffy and upscale.

30,it's ok if you are already in the area for an event,"if you're going to the Staples Center, Microsoft Theater or Grammy Museum this is a cool place to check out but I would not make it the prime destination. the restaurants are decent but overpriced. we were unlucky enough to be there the night of a Nickelodeon star's concert and it was mayhem! thousands of little girls dress like unicorns and rainbows. maybe check if there are any events going on in the area first.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lorimendenhall
50,"A great pre-game, or post-game destination for visitors to LA!","We had read about this precinct and it didn't disappoint. We walked here ahead of a Lakers Game at Staples Centre and really enjoyed it. Super clean, safe, very well lit, loads of buzz and well organised pathways for large crowds to move through.The people watching was fabulous and the dining options ranged from very high end to cheap eats, we sat down and enjoyed a delicious large pizza and drink for $14 ..bargain! The LA Live eatery precinct is modern, cool, hip and everyone there was loving the vibe - a great destination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JacquiSydney
30,Great for tourists or for pre or post game entertainment,"Most major cities have manufactured destination spots. LA has Hollywood Boulevard, New York has Times Square, etc. This is a second such location for LA. It's not that it doesn't have things to do but it really isn't authentic LA. If you are a tourist staying downtown then this is a place to have some entertainment and eating options. If you are a local then it's a place for a pre/post-Staples Center game or a concert dinner/drink which is good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StationToStation
40,A Happening Place,This was the first time we had stayed in the Staples Center area and we were not disappointed with the variety of things to do.

50,Holiday Cheer,"We often think about heading downtown for some entertainment but are always concerned about the traffic and crowds. After enjoying some entertainment at LA Live we always come away with how well designed the facilities are from traffic flow, to parking near the venue, restaurants, etc. even with competing events like a Laker game, things move along well for such large crowds. Prior planning like making restaurant reservations is a must and will definitely add to your enjoyment. Using your navigation app is really helpful with all the one way streets and alternates you are forced to take with backed up freeway on ramps.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BoboTravlr

30,Great Place With a Terrible Outside,"The Live grounds were awesome but LA is consistently under-whelming. Everything is a horrible shade of tan, barbed wire over most signs, too many homeless, smalls of human feces, and too expensive. Use 3D on Google Maps.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EasttoWeston

50,Fun Block Party,"LA Live was conveniently located by the hotel we stayed for our trip, Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown. We attended a free block party and had the time of our lives. There was so much to see and do from dancing to watching body painting and the thing we loved the most $5.00 block party menu at most of the restaurants. It's a must do for anyone visiting LA. Can't wait till my next trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P5313ZAjamiep
40,try to come here when there is an LA live block party or DTLA dark nights,I like to come to this location really only when there is a summer DTLA dark nights or their free block party. During that time most of the restaurants offer a $5 menu no it doesn't mean you will get a full sized meal for that amount but one can cobble together enough to eat on $5/dish. I really suggest eating as early as possible becuz the crowds can get large especially the wolfgang puck location.Other then the food depending on what is setup can be anywhere from live bands to a street carnival atmosphere. Oh by the way those who have pet dogs can bring them as long as they are on a leash. During the summertime its a fun diversion. also for those who don't care to drive you can take the metro line to either the 7th street stop or the pico station and its a short walk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hoben01
50,Great downtown area,"We stayed here at 1 of the 4 Marriott properties: Residence Inn, Courtyard, JW and Ritz - all in the same immediate area.There are many restaurants in the immediate area with every food choice you could want.Walking distance / same area as Staples Center, Convention Center, Grammy Museum, Microsoft Theater plus a grocery store if staying in hotel and a huge movie theatre.Lots of action and LA vibe to see if you are a tourist to LA. It’s a good central place to stay during a visit to LA too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdvtrTrvlr
50,LA LIVE COMPLEX,"Conveniently located in Los Angeles' rapidly growing downtown area lies LA LIVE. LA LIVE is a dedicated area that houses various and sundry touristy inspired events, restaurants, hotels, concerts, sports facilities as well as a Convention Center. If you secure a hotel room in the LA LIVE area (most hotels in this area are ""Marriott based) there are a plethora of restaurants from which to dine and the range of food from which to choose is breathtaking. (Sushi, standard American, Italian, seafood, steak, etc.) You can conveniently find a restaurant to suit your varied tastes. Its also a great place to hang if you want to go check out either a Laker or Clippers game (the Staples Center in approximately a one minute walk from the JW Marriott LA LIVE Hotel, for example) or you can check out a first run movie at the Regal Cinema Theatre across the street from the JW Marriott hotel (again a one minute walk). Or if you'd like to go bowling there's a bowling alley connected to LA LIVE as well!LA LIVE is also designed so that once you arrive in this area you can pretty much walk around to all of the sights and events and restaurants as the primary lure is that everything is, essentially, in one venue area. If you've got time or you travel to Los Angeles on vacation this is a great place to stay and to have an adventure that you'll definitely enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/760troyw
20,Meh,"if you have business with the convention center, then this area is convenient. Otherwise, you are wasting your time. Every restaurant is a chain and mostly rather mediocre. I'd rather walk for 30 mins than eat at any venue around here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GourmandTrashPanda
40,Good venue,Went to see a show with my daughter. I actually loved this place. I loved the set up it was very roomy it was very clean. From everywhere you could see the stage so the viewing was great. The only thing I’m would say is it sounded like one of the speakers were blown and in this particular show the lights from the stage came and just blinded us. So would’ve given it a rating of five if it wasn’t for those two things.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patriciasF1199XU

50,L.A. Live is Awesome!!,"We went to L.A. Live and took in the energy of the area. There were people going to bars and restaurants. We like to people watch. At night the place is lit up and high energy. It sits right next to the Staples Center. We were able to see and take pictures with the statues of Magic Johnson (my favorite), Kareem-Abdul Jabbar and the newest statue of Shaq. If you park in the garage underneath it is $5.00 for two hours. I was very surprised yet pleased at the price. This was a great stop!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grissmg
40,Nice Space and Nice Size (not too big or impersonal),"I have been here two times and both times I was impressed by how intimate the space felt even though it's relatively large. The sound has always been excellent (once was for a live recorded radio show and one was for a concert of an r and b singer.) I enjoyed myself. The seats were comfortable, and it was very easy to find an upscale place to eat nearby. Both times, I went to Fleming's Steakhouse nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T5193HZmelissad

40,Great place to eat before a game,We went early before a game at the Staples Center to get something to eat. Parking was easy and only a short walk to plenty of dining options.

30,What can I say about LA Live?,"Well...we were STARVING when we arrived to LA. We dropped our bags off and hopped on the train looking for drinks and a burger. We went from place to place in search of good food and decent priced drinks. MEH...Mission NOT accomplished. We were told to go a burger place similar to In & Out (not near LA live btw...but was told it was close), but didnt offer drinks. There was another review saying this place was over rated and I couldnt agree more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NikkiCrk
30,No big whoop.,"We were in the area visiting family, so we took in this area during our stay.There isn't much to do here, honestly. The Grammy Museum wasn't open on the day we were there, neither was the Staples, but we were able to take in the statues of Shaq, Jerry West, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar--that was cool.Also, we were there about a week before the Espy's were broadcast, so we saw the staging area.Other than that, it's a restaurant heavy area that is clearly meant for special events--hardly a place I'd be drawn to on any given day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SouthernMama2
50,Modernized Downtown,"I come to L.A. Live as is close to USC. LA live has definetely modernized the downtown area.

Whether it is concerts at The Novo, meals at the Yard House or basketball at Staples there is plenty to enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexBTraveler
20,Over Rated Area,"LA Live is an overrated area of Los Angeles. It is mainly a teenager/tourist type of area near the LA Convention Center and Staples Center. There is also a couple of hotels nearby. Most of LA Live is dedicated to over priced stores and restaurants. If you walk a few blocks north in to Downtown LA, you can find less expensive meals than at LA Live.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Metrotorrance
20,Outdoor reception at a conference,"We attended a reception while at a conference. Athough we were trapped in a fenced area, we still had to have bag search and go through metal detectors. The food from Wolfgang Puck was reasonable, but there was little space to move around or eat. I am not personally a fan out large digital billboards flashing all around me, so I found it cramped and an unenjoyable sensory overload. I walked through en route to a dinner another night and the crowding was gone, but there's a cheesy vibe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grlnsrgn
40,Event Deck blast,"Four of us attended the 9:30pm, Saturday, performance of Absinthe in a tent on the roof Event Deck. It's a lovely venue where, though crowded, the L.A.

We'd come back to this venue anytime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Toreadorable
30,It was worth a visit,"I was in the area early in the morning so I decided to walk around and see what they have to offer.

50,"Cool, safe place to take in a pre-game meal","Attended an NBA basketball game at the Staples Centre across the street and wandered over for a post game meal at Tom's Urban. Great place to eat, great service and great food.

40,"Restaurants, Ice-skating, Christmas Tree!","L.A. Live is a fun entertainment complex in downtown Los Angeles. It is in close proximity to the Staples Center and the Los Angeles Convention Center. Valet parking in a nearby parking garage made easy access to the area. We were there on a Thursday evening and the Staples Center was hosting a hockey game. The complex was crowded with exuberant hockey fans.We were excited because of the large, beautiful Christmas tree ringed by the temporary outdoor ice-skating rink. Four of our party took to the ice. We soon discovered that there was so much water on the ice that it made enjoying the skating difficult. Staff members were squeegeeing it off, but it was still a mess. When a grandson took a spill on the ice, his clothes were completely soaked. We had to leave and couldn't even enjoy dinner at one of the enticing restaurants at the LA.

30,Make Dinner Reservations & Arrive Early!,"LA Live is a large open-air venue surrounding The Staples Center, Microsoft Theater, Grammy Museum, with the LA Convention Center just down the street. We have visited before for other concerts and sporting events without any problems to find a place to eat before a show. Last night was a different experience, as we couldn't make any short-notice reservations (Open Table or restaurant sites not accepting them 5 pm-7 pm) so we took our chances at the last minute. At 5 pm before a 7:30 show, we went to Rock 'n Fish and Wolfgang Puck where we (and others) were told of a 45 minute wait even though there were lots of unoccupied tables. At Katsuya, it was a 2-hour wait and only one table on the huge patio was occupied at 5 pm. The Yard House (they do not take reservations for parties fewer than 7) was out the door. We were able to duck into Tom's Urban, which worked out great and we saw the Rams-Dallas game plus Olympics, and had a good meal & drinks. Judging by the reviews we have seen on TripAdvisor and Open Table for the other restaurants, it looks like we made a good choice. It is apparent to us that these restaurants need to amp up their service and food quality to accommodate the visitors to this venue. In the future, we won't plan on eating at LA Live but opt for a nearby, off-premise restaurant and hope for a better experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/olinmom
10,Extremely Crowded and Noisy; For a Young Crowd,"""L.A. Live"" is a unique open-air mall space, different from anything I have seen anywhere else. It contains two very large entertainment venues -- The Staples Center and Microsoft Theater; The Novo by Microsoft is a third, somewhat smaller (though still quite large) event space for entertainment or corporate events. The complex also includes The Conga Room (dining and dancing) and access to the L.A. Convention Center. Plus, there's a multiplex cinema.Outdoors, you have a public space with a stage and rows of elevated bleachers. When I was there, it seemed like a DJ was holding forth on a live radio program.The area is also ringed with a variety of restaurants.I was there on Thursday and Friday nights in August. The area was jam-packed with people (mostly a young crowd), and on top of the din from the crowd, loud music was blaring from loudspeakers. If that's your scene, go for it. I'm well past the point of enjoying crowds and extremely loud music. if you're like me, I'd recommend skipping this one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuzanneDu
40,Good restaurants.,"Although I would not go out of the way to make this a stop during a visit to L.A., if your plans bring you downtown anyway, then L.A. Live has a good selection of restaurants worth checking out. It seems to cater primarily to the crowds that are attending events at the Staples Center, the Microsoft Theater, and the Convention Center. It also provides some nice dining options for people staying at the nearby hotels, like the J.W. Marriott, the Ritz-Carlton, and the Residence Inn.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ERFSU82
30,Expected More from L.A.,"So we're spending the day in L.A. and our friend wants to attend the evening L.A. Live event in downtown near Staples Center. The advertisements make it sound great. Music, food, vendors, street artists, etc. I mean it's L.A. so it must be good, right!Well it was okay. The music was a DJ and he was okay. The vendors were overpriced and I've seen same or better in local areas. The restaurants offered some reduced prices for special menu items and there were actually some good selections for low price. They also offered $10 parking after 6pm but you had to find the lot, which I didn't. But the restaurant we ate at would validate your parking. So it ended up at $10 instead of $15 for 2 hours.The best attraction were the street artists. There were several large murals painted that evening and they were good, very good.Worth the trip to L.A.? No. Already in L.A., then maybe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ralphh909
50,There is Always Something to Do at LA Live,"LA Live houses Staples, the Microsoft Theater and down the street is the Convention Center. The Ritz and Marriott are located here as well as great eateries.Parking is for a fee, about 20$, and it can be a short walk to get where you want, but once there you will love it.They have huge TVs outside and beautiful walking areas. When there is an event it is great. They decorate for Christmas and it is beautiful.There are dozens of really good restaurants and some stay open a little late.The neon is great and it is like a very small City.

50,"""City That Never Sleeps"" within after-hours sleepy DTLA (complete with activity & plenty of parking)","Not sure when it actually closes, or ""sleeps"" as it were, but like other readers have mentioned it does have a mini-Times Square feel with the oversize neon and jumbo-tron-esque ads running, not to mention the slightly inflated prices for the eateries. (There are a few spots with inexpensive sandwiches, or one could split an entrée, no one minds.) We had just visited the Grammy museum for our Valentine's outing, and were drawn to all the exciting sites and sounds going on outside the door, so off we went to explore. What a great place amid all the other Sunday ghost town goings on that we drove through to get there; and what I imagine would be even more of a hopping place during a sporting event. Having been born in N.Y. (Long Island to be exact, home of the Islanders,) & raised in Oklahoma, as well as loving the color green growing up, hence being a Celtics bball fan back then, I playfully thumbed my nose at the opening of the Staples Center where the dreaded Kings and Lakers play home games-haha. One note- take your time when searching for a parking spot, as there are cheaper locations just a few blocks from this location other than the 20$ fee we were charged to park right next door. We were in a hurry to get to the museum before it closed, so we were more focused on finding the location rather than scoping out a spot. We saw a couple of 6$ lots as we drove away, but it was well after night fall, so the reason may also be that it gets cheaper after dark, either way, I would just advise to be more aware of options. I haven't investigated, but the parking meters nearby might also have been disabled or made less expensive after hours. Best of luck and have fun kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TiffMateas
50,Great place to enjoy before a LA Kings game!,LA Live has everything to enjoy before watching the LA Kings. My wife and I will always grab dinner at different places before the games.

30,the real downtown of la,"it is very busy here where a lot of people hang out. staple center is right next to the street so it will be very crowded on match days. also fancy hotels are near the street and a lot of restaurants are here too but the fact is that those restaurants are expensive and really crowded so normally you have to wait up to 30 minutes at least when you visit there at prime time. otherwise you can meet people here and see how they wear, talk, behave and more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minimize940314

40,Cool spot next to Staples Center,"LA Live is great place to hang out. At night time is when it really comes alive with all the LCD screens and lights. The visual effects are excellent. They have about 20 restaurants there to eat from high end dining to burgers. Even though they have 20 restaurants, it does seem limited on variety of food. Most dining places are gigantic. It would of been cool to have a lot more of small to medium restaurants and bars. Then you could go bar-hopping. However, the place is well designed and really nice.

Except for the hotel's front entrance hedge, not a green space in sight - and little left of the pathetic, drought-stricken twigs planted along the streets.The plaza was hoatching with kids in funky dress attending the Shania Twain and Taylor Swift concerts in the Staples Centre.

40,A little business and fun,"Went to a work conference downtown LA and brought with me my daughter and her friend and mom. Went exploring towards the staple center and there was LA Live, setting up for the ESPY's. I wish we had one more day to hang around and see the place at night. It was a little disappointing that they had a lot of the area blocked off because they were rolling out the red carpets. Could not get to the other side to the restaurants so we back tracked and found this underground mall with restaurants. It was bizarre. Are some great lasagna from this authentic Italian place that you order at the counter and you take your tray and find a place to sit like a normal mall food court. Would have loved to have stayed at LA live and eat at one of the outdoor cafes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jimnjdy
40,Hot Spot & Great Spot for Drinks or a Bite Before the Game,"The LA Live Complex is right at the Staples Center with numerous restaurants/bars ready to accommodate the pre-game crowds, and conference crowds at the Marriott/Ritz Hotels. It's a Hot Spot fueled by the excitement of the Staples Center and the activities surrounding it. Even if you don't go to a game, it's a great place to hang-out and have drinks/apps/dinner. By no means fine dining, but generally, the food & drinks are pretty good in this area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KVM101

30,I don't totally get it.,"Is it just me, or is downtown (and specifically LA Live) a bit off?I’d spent 20 years in LA before moving away about 5 years ago. The whole LA Live thing grew after that. I perfectly fine, but everything closes a bit early for a major metropolitan center. There is NO shopping of any kind in the area. I guess they are just trying to make a restaurant thing to support Staples Center. I’m not sure that was ever really needed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robinest01
40,NICE!!!!!,"Safe. good place pre or post concert, for drinks, night life, or eats. Subway is a 5 minute walk. Nokia theatre and Staples center are modern venues.

30,First Time Visitor,"It was loud, crowded, lots of lights and people but nothing to really get excited about. It seemedas most things in LA it was overated and overpriced if you wanted to eat in the area. They hada team member making pictures with fans but the line was extremely long and out of control. Itdefinitely was something we wanted to experience and we did it before the crowds got too rowdy.Would not make a special effort to do this again and certainly wouldn't recommend if you hadchildren with you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jhollingsworth11
30,I love the vibe of LA LIVE,"If you are there during award show season, or sports season you will see LA LIVE filled with people all night long.There is a number of restaurants and gift shops.I would recommend trying some of the food here instead of inside of the pricey Staples Center. I wouldn't recommend necessary driving here for LA LIVE itself but rather making sure to stop by while you're in the Staples Center area.The views here are beautiful, especially at night, just look up and around..you are surrounded by gorgeous buildings.My favorite part about LA LIVE is the buzz when everyone is out and about.If you are a sports fan and want to meet someone with the same enthusiasm this is place to be!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/562margaritas
20,Disappointing,"I've been to LA Live twice already and I've yet to find this an exciting destination. Frankly, it's rather boring with limited choices in terms of dining venues. It's also quite far walking from the metro stations downtown. There are some flashy neon lights but this is far from the Times Square in NYC which they were trying to imitate. There isn't that many spots for people to sit down and relax either. Unless you're going there to see a show or game specifically, don't waste your time at this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LouC151
40,Pregame!,Lots of options for food and things to do before catching a game at the staples center. We always go here to grab a burger (way cheaper than the stadium) and also to stop by Stubhub to print our tickets out (for free).Very busy and loud! Not a good place for kids but great for a drink or two. We will continue to keep going here before the hockey games.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdamJ9
40,Lots to do,"I took my 13 yr old son on a trip to LA. We were able to get free tickets to a taping of Sportsnation on ESPN, which is what brought us to LA Live.

The Grammy museum is here as well as a Regal Cinema 14 which has the first 4D movie theater in the U.S. reportedly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/David116116
50,Lots of options,"I went to LA Live for the purpose of grabbing lunch. There were many options from sushi to burgers. The restaurants were all reasonable LA prices and of great regard. There are places like Katsuya and Wolfgang Puck's. There are also movies, shows, and attractions here. During my visit, it was Halloween, so there was actually a carnival set up that you could visit. This is a great places to visit if you are headed to an event at the Convention Center, Staples Center, and the Nokia Theater or Plaza due to its proximity to these places. Parking it pricey, but it was really easy to get to from the Blue Line.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tattooedmomboss

30,A Huge Neighborhood Sports and Entertainment Complex,"This is a restaurant lifestyle center abutting the LA Convention Center, Staples, and Nokia. Many sports-themed restaurants, bars, and a dance hall or two. The Grammy Museum is located here. Really hops when one of the larger venues is popping, particularly at night. But not unlike any other complex of this type in any other city. Only this is L.A. So maybe you would consider it a bit more special. But, beware, the surrounding streets don't give off similar vibes, so this is more like an island playground surrounded by lots of boring street passages. You can use Metrorail or the any number of bus lines to get here, avoiding parking and traffic hassles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zoom_Gotti
40,"Great, lively atmosphere",This is a collection of eateries around the LA Convention Center and the Staples Center. A lively nightlife here with some upscale restaurants. May not be the best place for small children-more of an over 21 atmosphere. Skip the Grammy Museum. A cool bowling alley (Lucky Strijes). A bit over priced-but average for LA and at least it is a clean area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rong767
50,L.A. Live is very Live,"Went here for a couple of NBA Games & man the atmosphere is crazy. Being from Miami, but a lover of the Lakers made this a very special visit to me. It was awesome seeing all of the laker decor as well as clippers for all the success they had this season & upcoming playoff games. There are lots of screens filled with advertisements, places to eat & just bright lights. You can also check out some of the places nearby like Nokia Theater, Staples Center, & Grammy Museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craigd413
50,L. A. Live Was Covered with Orange and Blue,"The Auburn pep rally was at the Nokia Plaze at LA Live on Sunday the day before the game. About 5,000 AU fans took over the plaza dressed proudly in Orange and Blue. The Laker Fans did not know what was going on when they arrived for the Laker game that night and found the Plaza barricaded for the pep rally!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/117WayneG117
30,"Overpriced, Crowded","I recently went with a group to a 1 1/2 day conference at the Nokia Theater, which is part of L.A. Live. Although it was breathtaking to be surrounded by all the lights and some tall buildings when standing in the main courtyard at night, we found the food choices in the area to be limited. There is one row of nice restaurants along one side of the courtyard, but they were incredibly inadequate to satisfy the needs of thousands of conference-goers when we came looking for dinner and lunch. It simply needs more restaurants and more of a variety of choices. All the restaurants were sit-down and when we came an hour and a half before the first evening of the conference, there was no hope of getting food anywhere in the area before it started. We ended up eating hot dogs for dinner inside the Nokia theater-a huge disappointment.Another thing I observed is that the Staples Center and Nokia theater are across the street from each other. When they have simultaneous events, the resources available are further stretched, as we experienced one night of the conference when there was a Kings game.I don't know why anyone would want to come to this area unless they are coming to an event located there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeniseA_11

30,Nothing special but still ok.,"It wasn't anything special. If you're going to see something at the Staples Center or going to a convention at the convention center then it would be worth a quick trip but otherwise not worth it. I went there to see the Nike 3 on 3 basketball tournament so I wasn't bored but if that wasn't there it would have been really boring. There is a movie theatre, some restaurants, the Grammy museum and... that's it. Most of the restaurants were chain restaurants that you can find elsewhere. If you lived in the area then it might be an ok spot to go to a movie or go for a dinner with friends but out of towners with no other reason to go here don't bother. BTW, there is some parking options nearby so you can pretty easily avoid the overpriced parking garage they have there which can cost you up to $25/$30.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EugeneK804

50,Party On,The conference I attended booked this outdoor venue for the welcome reception that was over the top. It was great to be surrounded by beautiful buildings that included the Staples Center. There space is so large that the event was able to build in lots of variety for places to congregate and eat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EnjoyingLifeinTampa

40,Lively spot for food and entertainment,"Took a 7 minute ride by train from the USC campus to LA Live. Train stop is only a few minute walk to reach the Staples Center. There was a Clippers game going on that night, so the area was buzzing with activity. Looks like it was built to be like Times Square in NY, but a smaller, tamer version. Plenty of food places and shopping to choose from, as well as entertainment venues from the Staples Center to the Nokia Theater. They were doing a live broadcast for the Clippers game from the plaza outside the Staples Center which was cool to see. There was definite police presence in the area but we had no issues with walking around late into the evening and taking the train back to campus. It's worth a stop if you're in the area. Take the train so you don't have to pay for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauries614
40,Very Nice upbeat setting,"Ideal to support the Staple Center and Convention Center with entertainment and restaurants. Typical downtown parking cost. Not too bad access by car or rail and close to freeways. The down side is the traffic on work days.Love the large outdoor big TV screens and location to Staples, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/windiveski
50,"If you haven't been here, you haven't seen LA !","Totally renewed area where you'll get great variety of concerts, pro basketball and pro hockey games, selective dining experiences and many more activities.If you come to visit L.A., this is a must see place !Enjoy Los Angeles !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheFoodTraveler
40,"L.A. Live itself is a pretty impressive area, especially if they could eliminate the (almost) pointless Grammy Museum","We walked over to L.A. Live from a nearby Metro station. This is the entertainment complex for Los Angeles and according to the Starline tour brochure, it is referred to as ""Times Square of the West"". Well it sort of is (there are giant screens in the main Nokia Plaza area), but it is certainly not as crowded as either there or the Hollywood Walk of Fame to the northwest. L.A. Live is home to the Nokia Theater (where many award shows) and the Staples Center across the street (more award shows held there). In the sidewalk of the southeast corner of the complex (where we were), there are disk plaques (similar to the Canada and Hollywood Walk of Fame) that list the winners of the four ""main"" categories of each Grammy Award ceremony over the years. Speaking of Grammies (at the time of this writing there is less than 24 hours before they start), most of the complex has restaurants and cinemas, but the only attraction here is probably one of the greatest crimes I have ever seen befall a museum.(Note: the following version is much cleaner than my seperate review of the attraction. It also is more detailed)The Grammy Museum was the only thing we came specifically here for. Do NOT do it at all (unless you like museums with any of the cons I have stated below). It is way overrated (why does everyone keep rating the place 5 stars???) and a waste of time and money. Even if I was more into this sort of stuff (which I am not), it is still very bad for ten reasons: (start with 100 pillars)1. It costs nearly $13 to get in. The price may not sound like much at first, but when combined with all the other cons below, it has a big effect (paying $75 for a 5-day Park Hopper at Disneyland is an EXCELLENT run for money, but paying $13 for a small and crammed in museum is NOT). This also comes further since many other attractions in LA are free (Observatory, science center, City Hall observation deck, etc.). Even furthermore, they offer NO DISCOUNTS and LA does not do any Citypass because of the majority of free museums (Pillars 1-10 crash down).2. It is COMPLETELY ISOLATED from all the other museums and attractions in LA. Many museums in big cities tend to be placed in ""clumps"" (Seattle Center, National Mall, Chicago Museum Campus). In this city, the ""clumps"" are Exposition Park and the Miracle Mile of Wilshire Boulevard. If you drive here, parking ain't free (of course, as is just about anywhere in downtown LA). If you come here by tour bus, the only one that stops at L.A. Live is Starline's Purple Route which (according to their schedule) runs every one and a half to three hours (isn't this a bit of an inefficient schedule for a tour bus service in a big city like this?). (Pillars 11-17 crash down).3. They do not allow photos anywhere inside the ENTIRE INTERNAL MUSEUM PREMISE (YES, not even inside the ENTRANCE LOBBY????!!!). Most museums that do or did restrict photos usually consider(ed) it okay inside the entrance/exit area, but for this place the moment you pass through the front doors...BAM!! the gun goes off (not literally). If that weren't bad enough, they make absolutely NO REASON AT ALL WHY THEY RESTRICT PHOTOS and I SEE NO CLEAR SIGN OF ANYTHING THAT COULD EVEN SUGGEST SO!!! And this comes because of several cases. While I see no risk of competition (applies to places like manufacturing facilities, certain store chains, etc.), nor do I see any risk of tight security cases (applies to places like military bases, correctional facilities, etc.) or lack of respect to the readers or dead (applies to places like libraries, chapels, any place with dead people's remains, etc.). In terms of copyright, things vary. While significant copyright exists in EVERYTHING (from a toy car to the Statue of Liberty), this does not mean that photos should be restricted completely. Aside from the usual places (film/TV set, any room where films are screened), the cases in museum artifacts when the copyright will be serious enough to restrict photos in nearly all cases (with the exception of the Smithsonian which prefers to be more concerned about flash damage on certain artifacts rather than copyright) is generally if the artifacts are:a. Any kind of equipment made purposely for media or stage use (props, camera or stage equipment, etc.). However, some places ignore this partially (Hollywood Museum restricts only flash and video both for obvious cases)b. Any kind of early design work (drawings, sketches, blueprints, etc.)c. Any kind of word-processed work (whether it is a letter, map or any other printed work)d. Photographs or portraits of any sort (if they are the exhibits central subject)e. The inside of any historic place at risk of being turned into a fake documentary (White House, Windsor Castle, etc.)f. Anything related to Disney's likeness (being that it is the company infamous for this reputation). This is obvious in some places like the Walt Disney Family Museum (or WDFM) in San Francisco which restricts photos inside due to copyright (as website states) and rightly so since the artifacts are a, b,c, and of course the whole purpose of the place being f. so that hardly matters.The museum has none of the above in its main exhibits and when it does, they are mainly in the special exhibitions. In fact, this does not change what other similar museums have for their restrictions. There is the EMP Museum (Seattle) and it is has the same sort of artifacts as this museum does. It restricts only flash and video (former prevents damage on the artofacts and the latter prevents copyright over the music). Then the Country Music Hall of Fame or CMHOF (Nashville). Same artifacts; only flash and video are restricted for same cases as EMP. Then The Beatles Story (Liverpool), it only restricts photos in certain areas. So I don't get it. THREE SIMILAR museums that do photo restrictions in a more satisfying way, but this place you CAN""T. In fact many museums that did restrict photos in the past have gone to restrict only flash or restrict to certain areas. If this is how I should see things approach like this RESTRICT FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO IN THE MAIN EXHIBITS AND ONLY RESTRICT PHOTOS COMPLETELY IN CERTAIN EXHIBITIONS. Otherwise, this is not only making it impossible to remember the experience (I can't even remember if any of my cons are even correct), but also rips off the steep admission price and the amount of time to get here (Pillars 18-36 crash down)4. The Museum's exhibits descriptions on the website seem to be clever at describing in detail as if they have outdone every other place saying things like ""you are fully immersed"" or ""exciting array"" and even distorting the images of the place (Hmmm, sounds a bit suspicious doesn't it?). But.... NO! It is nowehere even close. The way they describe it tries to use as much detail and they make it sound like a huge walk-through museum (like the WDFM). It also appears big on the outside when you first get there but the website does its best to HIDE THE FACT THAT EACH OF THE THREE EXHIBIT PARTS ARE MOSTLY CRAMMED INTO ONE ROOM, which also RIPS OFF the price. In fact, I felt like there was some kind of fortress wall trying to force this museum over the edge of the building. What is with all the reviewers of the place saying you could be here for 5-6 HOURS???!!! We were through most of the museum in LESS THAN A HALF HOUR!!!!!! The only way you could be here for that long is if you go from the top floor to the bottom, turn around, go back up the stairs, start going down through the exhibits again and repeat that 20 or so times (if you do it at the same speed each time). In fact the museum's size is tiny compared to scale (out of 100) with the following museums below: (following is not accurate, but close)Royal BC Museum (Victoria, Canada) - 25/100Any Smithsonian Museum - 5/100Walt Disney Family Museum (now that was the place that took us 5 hours to go through in one go - it is impressively done) - 15/100Buffalo Bill Historical Center (even this place is one-hundred times better in comparision) - 20/100So paying $13 for a museum that is this small is a waste for the money. In fact according to the L.A. Live map, it is the smallest part of the complex. So really, couldn't this museum just move to a bigger space??? However, the fact that it opened in 2008 (a.k.a Recession year) brings on suspicion of why it ended up being so small and crammed in (lack of federal funds to make itself a more ""proper"" museum eh?). (Pillars 37-48 crash down)5. The exhibits are layed out sloppily and maintain absolutely no continuity or consistency whatsoever (was making the museum one-way really that necessary?? It surely does not if there is not any form of chronologic sequence within the museum). Compare this to the WDFM which it does a PERFECT chronologic sequence of Walt's life from the beginnings to his death (even the museum seemed much bigger on the inside than the on the outside). (Pillars 49-57 crash down)6. There is not as much interactive stuff as the museum website suggests. Other than an interactive drum set (although a few people were still having some problems at trying to get it to work), everything else was either apprarently ""broken"" (failed to notice at first; yes this happens to high-tech stuff a lot. And it often takes forever (by means of weeks or months) to fix it. Disneyland would get them back up and running in just hours and minutes) or do not even exist. (Pillars 58-61 crash down)7. While it is not plainly visible in the museum itself (I have never been to the other places, but I do know what they have), nothing is original about this place. Most of the place is probably a repeat of information you can find in places like the EMP, CMHOF and Cleveland's Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame. All three of those places are much bigger and they opened first. (Pillars 62-65 crash down)8. This is not exactly bad as such but the museum's hours are just BIZZARRE. While they open at the usual 10:00am time on weekends, but on weekdays at 11:30am??? Wouldn't it make more sense to open at 10:00am Monday-Saturday and 11:30am Sunday (which many other museums do with their hours)? However, when the place first opened I distinctly remember the website saying the hours as 10:00am-8:00pm every day, but now they seem to have cut the closing hours back by half an hour and the opening hours back by one and a half hours. Either this is to do with budget cutbacks, dropping attendence or both. In either case, this brings to suspicion on how much longer the museum will last. (Pillar 66 teeters, but does not fall)9. The museum's exhibits and location are inconsistent with the nearby Staples Center where the awards are held. The exhibits make no reference to the venue and it does not even face the venue. (Pillar 66-71 crash down)10. With the exception of a Michael Jackson display (not much in it though, but that is at least what we are looking for) and a special Beatles exhibition (best part of the museum; it and the MJ display felt more respectful compared to the rest of the museum. Hey, I could have found that place more excellent if it had only been the two special exhibitions), the comes the worst part of all. While the museum has very little ""Grammy"" related stuff (despite its name, it is more music the subject of the awards which is not that bad) and they think they are preserving the history of the awards, but NO they do not do it properly at all. The only Grammy exhibition that is here is nothing but a GIANT COMMERCIAL ADVERTISEMENT ATTEMPTING TO PROMOTE THE LAST 6-7 YEARS OF THE AWARDS AND NOTHING ELSE!!!!!!!. In fact, the content of this part of the museum is ALMOST ENTIRELY GARBAGE FROM THAT PERIOD!!!!. AND THE WEBSITE DOES ITS BEST TO HIDE THIS AS WELL!!! Wow, this is sooo disrespectful to the second longest running award show history (running for 55 years now). This museum should have been called the ""Grammy Garbage Museum"" or the ""Grammy Museum of the last quarter of a quarter century"". In fact, many important ""older"" artists you would expect there to be a lot of (except for the above two I mentioned) are either promoted poorly or not at all within the museum. The museum seems to completely kill off Elton John (come one, he has won six Grammy awards and is one of the best-selling artists of all time), Adele (not old, but sounds and looks old; won 8 Grammy awards and is one of the most influential people in the world? Come on), Frank Sinatra (really???!!!!) or Queen (one of the biggest arena rock bands in the world and some of the biggest hits of all time!!). Other important older artists (such as Elvis Presley) are promoted poorly (they may be mentioned briefly, but I did not bother reading anything in most of the museum because of how awful the place was). So this museum practically disrespects both the awards and many important old artists. What are we gonna see happen next?? Gangnam Style take over the EMP Museum?? Smithsonian suddenly deciding to cut up the Wright Flyer and replace it with 787 stuff?? (of course that stuff would belong in their museum, but if they tried to do something to a heritage aircraft like that, they would have been met with a ""Hold it right there"" type of response) Presently, the EMP, CMHOF and Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame all respect the ""old"" stuff much more properly. Every other museum I have been in also respects things properly (The WDFM is not a giant Disney commercial, but a proper respectful presenting of Walt's life which is how it always will be). The Grammy Museum does not respect retroness for 60% of the exhibits. (Pillars 71-97 crash down; only three pillars are left standing one representing the drum set, the other two representing the special exhibitions)So, with the exception of the drum set, and the two special exhibitions all the above combined this museum is almost pointless if you want to know about the awards and is a huge waste of money. It disrespects things, you can't take take pictures, steeply priced admission, isolated from other museums. In fact, the disk plaques around L.A. Live cover the history of the awards a lot more than the museum (and are better in comparision). Since lack of federal funding would make it almost impossible for most of the above cons to be improved, I kind of wonder if the city should just cut the budget on the place (and sell the stuff to other museums). Until then, this will be the last time I see this museum. L.A. Live is much better in all means (and you don't need to pay for it if you walk). If you want to know more about the Grammies, look it up on the internet (even Wikipedia has more historical information on them than the museum does). If you want a music museum, go to any of the above ones that I mentioned (depending on which one you live closer to; if I were more into this stuff, I would prefer EMP since it is the closest). If you want interactive music, go to EMP since it has interactive drums, keyboards, guitars, virtual concert experiences, producing your own song or music video, etc. or even better yet, buy any of the Rock Band games (if you don't own them already; I don't, but I have seen them being played elsewhere) since interactive drums, guitar, keyboard and microphone are all featured here and you can play it at any time without having to pay every time (other than the price of buying the game). If you would rather stick to museums in LA, go to the observatory or science center instead (as well as both having free admission, the observatory is bigger, has free parking and everything about space you can think of is covered in the perfectly organised exhibits and the science center has more interactive stuff and now also has Space Shuttle Endeavour which is way more compelling). Or go to somewhere like the Hollywood Museum (more interesting stuff there which makes up for the $15 price; more retro even being in a historic building), the tar pits (more interesting stuff there; makes up for the $12 price) or the Petersen Car Museum (not been here, but its on a higher ranking for TA's top things in LA; also probably more interesting to see various cars from the past and future; makes up for $12 price). Or even tour somewhere like one of the film studios (we did Paramount; you get to see a lot. Plus they only restrict photos in a few ""obvious"" areas), the Queen Mary or USS Iowa. In either case you will get way more out of it for their prices than the almost pointless stuff in the Grammy Museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trainfan01
40,Hard to beat for pre/post game dinner/drinks,"L.A. Live is a colossal site - an unbelievable number of restaurants, the Grammy Museum, a large movie theatre complex and even a bowling ally (Lucky Strike). One could certainly be fully entertained for the better part of a day. I visited before a Clippers game and every restaurant was packed. I enjoyed the Yard House - hard to find a bar anywhere else that has 100+ beers on tap including very hard to find microbrews. L.A. Live has great buzz and it is literally just steps from the Staples Center. If you're coming before a game or concert get here early!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T4232XIjohnb

40,Tourist and teenage destination,"With so many restaurants and attractions in LA, this destination can be skipped over. The food is safe but overpriced and the attractions are minimal.

Well it ain't it's a deserted collection of bars and restaurants where vagrants loiter and mither you either entering or leaving the venue sorry with young kids this ain't for us.

40,Truly L. A. Live,"When you live somewhere for most of your life and then come back to your hometown to visit, sometimes you find that a lot has changed. That was the case for me. I moved toChicago in 1995 and come back to Los Angeles every once on a while. My quest began with the desire to watch a basketball game at Staples Center. We got some pretty good tickets for a really good price to a Clippers vs. Houston Rockets game.I've driven by this area many times, but have never been to L.A, Live. What is L.A. Live? It's an entertainment complex with many restaurants, shops, and night clubs. It is anchored by Nokia Theater. Two new luxury hotels were also built recently. The Staples Center is across the street along with the L.A. Convention Center. Looming stories above on three apartment buildings are the murals of Blake Griffin, Chris Paul, and DeAndre Jordan. The Clippers have soared in popularuty since the aquisition of Chris Paul. Ironically, a mural of Kobe Bryant advertising for Turkish Airlines is nearby reminding us that he is stilll a force to be reckoned. Another mural had huge images of Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law advertising their new movie Sherlock Holmes 2 reminding us that L.A. is still tinseltown.The construction of this entertainment complex allows angelenos and others a place to go to relax and to have fun. There was even an outdoor ice rink something unusual for L.A. Lot of people were walking around enjoying the atmosphere. It was especially lively because of the game, but I'm pretty sure people will come downtown now because there is a place to go to eat, drink, catch a movie, and have a good time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/firehorse1215
40,Very LIVELY place to visit!,"We were going to Staple and went two hours early to get dinner. The area has a ton of restaurants, but if you want to eat at the ones across the street from Staples, GO EARLY! Every restaurant had a minimum one hour wait... suggestion; so there early or go when you don't have an event to get to. Otherwise, it's a great place with a mini feeling of Times Square! There is also Lucky Strike bowling alley/restaurant/bar there and they were empty in the bowling area. So another great idea... go bowling and eat there for a fun night!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mamaduck131
40,Great Restaurants,"This is one of my favorite downtown spots for restaurants. Try Trader Vics and Katsuya for good Asian selections. LA Market in the JW Marriott has good, American cuisine.

It was 10:30 and we wanted sushi at Katsuya. The kitchen was already closed as it was at a number of other places. Rock n fish seated the four of us. Don't go unless you want to feel like you are in an airport terminal restaurant- ambience and food as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stylcounsel
40,What a pleasant surprise!,"Before I began researching for our trip to LA, I had not realized that the Staples Center, Nokia Theater and the Grammy Museum were all located in one complex. Unfortunately for us we couldn't get near the Staples Center because of the circus going on at the time, but we still loved being in the area and ate at the ESPN Zone (good food, great atmosphere for sports lovers.) Also they were setting up for the X Games which just added to the whole LA sports atmosphere. We'd go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimv300
40,LA Live has transformed downtown Los Angeles!,"My boyfriend and I flew to Los Angeles for 5 days in January to watch our alma mater win the Rose Bowl! Pasadena was a charming, sleepy town full of history and beauty. Most of the time though, we spent our days and nights in West Hollywood and downtown Los Angeles which has been transformed with the addition of LA LiVE and the Staples Center. LA LIVE has something for everyone and even had a small ice rink for children to go ice skating on during the holidays. From ESPN Zone to Starbucks Coffee and my favorite Rosa Mexicana restaurant (try the sangria and table side guacamole), you will not go hungry. After dinner, have a cocktail at the JW Marriott or Ritz Carlton and then go watch Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers at the Staples Center if you really want the LA experience. They dim the lights in the Staples Center and only highlight the court which makes the whole Lakers experience feel like an entertaining show! Your bound to see some celebrities like Jack Nicholson sitting court side too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5_Star_Holly
