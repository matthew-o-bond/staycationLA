50,Great Group Activity,I had a really fun time here on an outing with a group from work. The staff was friendly and it was easy to get signed in. They tell you everything you need to know before starting including giving a quick overview for people are doing an escape room for the first time. There are different themes in the rooms. We were split up into Wise Guys and Game of Swords. The escape rooms were well laid out and just challenging enough. Everyone really had a good time and our game master was great. I'd love to bring another group of folks over here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MayaD888

50,First timer. Had a blast!,"Went there with a group of friends around midday. The place was very clean and we were welcomed by Mike immediately, who was very friendly. Our game master Ron was very knowledgeable and and ensured we had a wonderful experience. We did both rooms, my favorite was the Wise Guys room but both were unique and challenging! Clues were straight forward so there wasn’t any unnecessary confusion, but definitely made you think outside the box to complete them. It was our first time doing an escape room and I would 100% recommend it. Thanks for the awesome time guys!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zack4491
50,Great customer support,We have been here twice with two different groups and to two different rooms and had a great experience both time. The first time we went with young kids and even they found ways to participate. Yesterday we went with a group of teens and Allen was particularly helpful. The support is awesome in that they give you just enough help at the right time so you feel successful while still being challenged. We can't wait for them to open their next room so we can go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/306rebeccak
50,Great Day at Planet Escape,Our day at Planet Escape was so much fun. Jay our host was fantastic. Can’t wait to come back and try the other room.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trishaski
50,So much fun,Escape rooms are the one thing that we can do as a family and everyone participates. Each person has ideas and helps solve the problem. It shows that we are better together. Will be back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RPVTravelmore
50,Wise Guy Theme,"The visit was amazing! The game fascilitators were awesome! Rules were totally clear and the ""Wise Guy"" game was so fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meander704324
50,Birthday outing success,"My sister, brother, and I decided to take our dad to an escape room as a father's day present. We just did Wise Guys and it was great!it was quite challenging and sometimes you feel like you don't even know where to begin. None of us had ever done it before. The crew had an excellent sense of when to nudge us in the right direction to keep us on track and time without giving away any answers. It forces teamwork and you draw on the strengths of others. It was a wonderful experience and we finished with a mere 4 seconds to spare. We all can't wait for the pandemic room to open next year!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeganInTokyo
50,50th Birthday Surprise for Hubby,"I surprised my hubby for his 50th birthday with a trip to Planet Escape Room. He and I had a blast! He loves solving puzzles so I thought he might enjoy this as a birthday gift. This was our first time in an escape room but will not be the last. We are hooked thanks to Allen, our host. He was very personable, informative and helpful. He even offered us a free snack and a soft drink, water or coffee while we were waiting. Can't wait till our next visit. :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IreneK90505
50,Fun Medium level room,"Our group of 3 adults and two 12 year olds played Wise Guys. One of the best parts about planet escape is that there is a parking lot!!! Parking at most escape rooms is an issue, but it’s not here.The theme was fun, the puzzles were good. The game is non linear which adds a little difficulty. The clues are given on a tv and you can also always see your time which is helpful. I def recommend not playing with more than 5 because some of the spaces are tight and it can feel a little claustrophobic.We escaped with 12 mins left. I’m excited to go back and play what when the new rooms open!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foxylf28
50,Great Escape!,"We are a family of 4, two are kids 15 & 12. The room was the right level for all of us. The kids did great and contributed as much if not more! Great host (Alan [sp?]), great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scotty964
50,Our first Escape Room. It won't be our last,My parents were visiting and we were looking for something fun to do. Planet Escape came highly rated and the idea of an escape room sounded intriguing. So glad we took the plunge We had so much fun. We enjoyed solving the challenging puzzles while we cooperated and shared lots of laughs. I highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaK766
50,Super fun!,"I've done over 15 escapes rooms so far and this is a good one. I'm not really into the storyline but I love rooms that incorporate tech and some simple ""oh wow!"" moments. And this room captures both. The game master gives you as much or as little help as you want. Best part...you don't have to share the room with strangers!!! Shout out to both Allen and Ivan. Can't wait for the next room to open.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrownDogMom
50,Fun puzzles - great environment and fantastic game masters,We are running out of escape rooms in Los Angeles so we were thrilled to see this relatively new company with one room open and four more on the way! We made Wise Guys our 185th escape room and had a lot of fun! We just had a group of 2 and made it out with a few minutes to go but we recommend 3 to 5 for this room.They have a reasonable mix of puzzles versus hidden stuff. Many of the puzzles were the multi-step kind that we find very satisfying. We have no issues with escape rooms using key or combination locks - they had many of those but also several satisfying triggered moments - the variety was fun. The types of puzzles were varied and all had clear and precise answers. The puzzles were also themed for the room scenario.The room has a few non-linear moments which means that teams of four or five will have plenty to do.The scenario is set up with a professionally made video which helps increase the immersive feel of the room. They made thoughtful and clever use of their set and set pieces.The game master Alan was terrific - we also met Mike. It is clear that this escape room is being designed and operated by true escape room enthusiasts. They told us that there next room will be open in a few weeks and we cannot wait to come back to give it a try.There is parking lot which is always a plus! Since the facility is very large they have the space for groups to host a party or a team-building event.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveling_a_lot4fun
50,Awesome birthday party idea,"I am thrilled that there is finally an escape room within 15 mins from my house. The concept of the Wise Guys room was challenging and creative. It was obvious that a lot of thought went into designing this room. Alan was an amazing game master. After we narrowly escaped with 7 seconds remaining, with some help, it was nice that Alan walked us through the puzzles we had solved. That was a first for me and I really liked that. Even the intro video was fun to watch. I’m really looking forward to the new rooms being created now. Can’t wait to come back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A1712ZXshannonb
50,Lots of fun; great staff,We had a great team building experience - one of the few places I found in the area that could accomodate up to 10 people. The staff were awesome and the room was a lot of fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrianK97
50,Awesome Game!,"We are from the Torrance area and was very surprised to hear of an Escape Room so close to home. We were hoping it would be a perfect outing for Mothers Day with the family. And the game did not disappoint! The worker, (Alan), explained in detail the do's and don'ts of the rooms and then the game began. It was an adventure and our group was able to get out with time to spare. Cannot wait for their next game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wardell60
50,Thumbs up!,"We had a great time for Mother’s Day. It’s nice that the room is only your group, in our case two adults and two young teens. Fun way to spend time with the kids. Everyone was able to add value in our escape. We plan to go again when new rooms open.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VictoriaK441
50,Escape Room Visit,"We loved this place. Alan, the staff member that was there for us, was so fun and friendly. The room was really cool and challenging enough for us without being frustrating. It was really neat learning each other’s strengths as we interpreted the various clues. Once the additional rooms open we will be back here. I highly recommend this Escape Room experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/35kamil
