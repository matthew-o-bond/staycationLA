40,Revitalized parkland,"A narrow strip of land along the Los Angeles River has been planted with native plants that attract many species of birds and many different butterflies and other fauna. There is a bike trail, the Los Angeles River Bikeway, walking and jogging paths, exercise equipment along the path, and grassy areas with benches or large rocks to sit on. The park get a little crowded with local families in the late afternoon and evening with small children riding big wheels along the path and playing on the park toys. They did a nice job revitalizing this park and the local neighborhood appreciates it. The park lacks a public restroom and has limited parking.",HappyWren_2014
