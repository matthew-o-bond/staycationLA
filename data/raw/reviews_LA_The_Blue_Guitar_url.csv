50,Wonderful Live Americana Folk Music Every Wednesday,"The Blue Guitar in South Pasadena is a great place to visit on Wednesday nights for original Americana music (7:15-9:45 pm). The music, like 1960's 'folk music', is poetry sung so you can understand the words. The songs make you feel good, tell a great story, or make you laugh. The Blue Guitar is a listening room, not a bar. It features different singers and bands every Wednesday night. If you like Jazz bands come on Thursday for great music. The room holds 50 so everyone is up close to enjoy the music ($12 for a seat or $17 for a seat at a table up front). You can buy food and drinks at the adjoining cafe or bring your own wine for a $10 cork fee. Once you come, you'll be back for more great music!blueguitar.club, 1055 Lohman Lane, South Pasadena, CA 91030 â€“ at the golf course",RoiFritz
50,A hidden gem....,"I had heard a little about this place, and was skeptical because of the location....(a room at a little 3 par golf course??). I went only because a couple of jazz greats were playing in a trio there...Jon Mayer (played with John Coletrane)...Roy McCurdy (played with Cannonball Adderley, Sonny Rollins); and I didn't know what to expect..... WOW....what a surprise....they were fantastic and the venue is really cool....(kind of a ""dump"" in a good way!)You can sit close enough to read the charts....bring your own wine....with only a $10.00 corkage fee...a cover charge of $12.00...it really can't be beat. Check their website...they have jazz one night a week and other music on another....What a find...to be able to see two jazz icons like this for $12.00! I will definitely be back...now that I figured out how to get there.",Roberto3250
