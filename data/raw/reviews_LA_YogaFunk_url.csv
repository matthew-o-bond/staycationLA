50,Truly caring atmosphere,"I started taking Yoga at YogaFunk in January 2017. The atmosphere is warm and caring, the instructors are excellent, and the classes, while sometimes full, are delivered in a way that individual students can make progress at their own pace, with options for different poses if needed, in a completely non-competitive environment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StaceyR406
50,Beautiful Studio; Great Vibe,"I go to YogaFunk whenever I'm in the Glendora/Azusa/Pomona area. The first thing I noticed upon going into the studio was how beautiful the entire facility is. The vibe is completely soothing and mellow; I love it. The floors are colored concrete, the walls are painted in tranquil blues and greens; the long hallway to the other section of the studio (where there are massage rooms and restrooms) has framed photos of teachers and studio members displayed with inspiring messages. Even the restrooms are awesome: pretty colors, glass decorations, nicely finished facilities, and individual towels to dry the hands. The yoga studio itself is large--there's a really nice wood floor, large mirrors on one wall, bolsters, blocks, and bands available to use. They have yoga mats you can rent too. YogaFunk is a clean and well-kept yoga studio.I've taken classes and one workshop with three of the teachers at YogaFunk. I have found the classes at level 1-2 and level 2-3 to be completely manageable, and I was able to accomplish most if not all of the practice at both levels (for comparison, I take 75-minute hot power vinyasa classes about 3 times a week). The classes here are not heated.I brought my son and a friend to a class one day. They are not yogis, per se; they do more activities like weight lifting and running, so I was concerned that they wouldn't be able to enjoy or benefit from the class. I was wrong. These two young guys (college-age) participated fully, maybe not stretching as well as they should, but they attempted all of the poses and helped each other with the inversions. And, they laughed and had a good time! I was really happy I brought them. The only downside was that they knew a very popular donut shop sits right across the street....so after a super-nice yoga class, they wanted to go get some donuts. And me, being a indulgent mom, got them some donuts. Completely against my religion, but hey....they did some yoga!The staff is very friendly, very approachable, very nice. If I lived in the area, I would definitely become a member and take several classes weekly. This is a great place to practice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Urbane415
