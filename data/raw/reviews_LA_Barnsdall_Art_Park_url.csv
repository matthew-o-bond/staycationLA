40,"See the famous ""Hollywood"" Sign!","We went to see the exterior of Frank Lloyd Wright's Hollyhock House (because we were not able to book a tour of the interior). We also visited the Municipal Gallery of Art, which was underwhelming. Lots of people were picnicking on the grass. Nice park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Professional-Pilgrim
40,Great way to spend an afternoon.,"First here in over 5 years, I'd forgotten how beautiful it is. Great area for walking, having a picnic or just sitting to read a good book. Be sure to get a pass to get and see the interior of the Frank Lloyd Wright house, it's worth! Stunning house, obviously built more for show than for living in, but I wouldn't say no if it were offered to me! I only wish the weather had been better, it was cloudy, cold, windy and a few sprinkles of rain and some thunder put a bit of a damper on the day. Can't wait to go back on a nice day. Oh and check out the views - WOW!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TLS5775
40,Quaint park to see the Hollywood sign and city,"This is a quaint little park where you can see the Hollywood sign and the Griffith observatory. You drive up a hill to get to the park on the top. So you are overlooking Hollywood (see pictures). There is a theater, art school, and I believe a museum. Been to two plays at the theater. Just a nice place to relax and enjoy time. No kid activities though, so more suited for couples. Makes a romantic date overlooking the city, especially at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Socalchat
50,Nice park with interesting art and great views,"At Barnsdall Art Park you can find the famous Hollyhock House by the architect Frank Lloyd Wright, The Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery, and different historical buildings. From the hill you have a nice view on the Griffith Observatory and the well-known Hollywood sign at the mountain. It is a visit worth!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AB_Stb_OZ
40,Views and a house,"It’s not much of a park - although plenty of people were enjoying the small grass patch next to the house - and there’s no art around the park, rather a gallery, a junior art foundation, and Hollyhock House, which is worth a $7 tour. Good views of the hills once you get up all the stairs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrdom
40,Sunday’s are art class days...,"We went with our grandkids to this place because they have free art classes on Sunday. That was very nice and kept everyone occupied for several hours.But just as nice is how large the grounds are for when the free art classes are over. The kids had a great time walking and exploring the park. There are actually tours offered, that provide some nice history of the buildings and the place. Frank Lloyd Wright did several of the buildings, but they are in some disrepair and I’m sure will be updated.Great views from the top of the park of many parts of LA. Well worth the trip, and it’s all free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/672donaldm
50,Beautiful park with great view of the city,"This park is easily located next to the Metro red line, and offers clean grass and a beautiful view of the city. One of my favorite places to meet up with people and chill, or bring a picnic. The art center sometimes has interesting exhibits, and there is a Frank Lloyd Wright house that you can tour, or simply admire from outside. Parking is available, but can be tight.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/escapedwinter
20,The gallery was closed,"The park provides a great view of Hollywood if you can climb the stairs. The gallery is closed Monday, Tuesday ,Wednesday so we were very disappointed",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Erlinda2g
50,"One of the best views of Observatory and Hollywood, from quiet grassy hills-bring a picnic!","I've lived in Hollywood for decades and never understood why this remarkable little park remains so uncrowded. Go by yourself or with family or a sweetheart, pack a picnic, and enjoy one of the best views in town-FREE! Most people look AT Barnsdall from Griffith Park Observatory, but looking up at the Hollywood Hills and seeing the observatory is very special indeed. Yuca's, home to perhaps the best Yucatan fare in town, was forced to leave their space just next door, but you can go to the original stand on a Hillhurst parking lot and bring their incredible food (anything ending in pibil; means slow cooked, amazing flavor--I go for pork Pibil). If you want more of an outing you can walk through their little art museum--always featuring something interesting. Or check the schedule and do a self-guided tour of Frank Lloyd Wright's Hollyhock. That's just $7 and I think you'd get enough out of just seeing/feeling his space up on the breezy hill. $70 for docent tour if you go for all the details. In short, this can be a free outing--bring a picnic, or a really reasonable way to enjoy one of the treasures of LA on the cheap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drjlever
40,Frank Lloyd Wright's Hollyhock,"If you are FLW fan there's lots to like about the house, the curators give you booties to put on your shoes to walk around the house, but much of it is roped off anyway so it's not enough of it to roam around. The dining room was roped off and the dining table and chairs seemed to be awol. Why you couldn't take photos, I'm not sure how that will hurt the place. I had to google it to see more of the house. The docents are very knowledgeable. The panoramic vistas from outside the house are impressive. You'd be hard pressed to spend more than an hour in the house. There is also an art gallery on the site, also designed by FLW which I did not go into. From an aerial shot on the internet there is a very large building on the property, but nothing was mentioned about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/983lynnem
50,Hollyhock House is worth the stop,"We enjoy Frank Lloyd Wright's aesthetic and try to see his work when we can. Hollyhock House did not disappoint. A beautiful example of Wright's use of the site and work combining shapes, elements, and themes. The hollyhock rugs are beautiful. The inside/outside theme is especially present as he worked with the LA climate. I wish his water feature in the house were functioning. Views from this house on the hill are terrific. We got there easily on the metro, leaving from LA's Union Station, which is also fun to see. A good half day activity in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KerryR1264
40,Nice place to relax away from the urban jungle,"Barnsdall Art Park is home to an Art Center that caters a lot to children and also has the Hollyhock House which was designed by famed architect, Frank Lloyd Wright. The park is on the top of Olive Hill, which is in East Hollywood and it seems like it is many miles removed from the City below although it provides 360 degrees of magnificent views of the City. It is a relaxing place where you can just relax or enjoy art or architecture. Unfortunately, the City seems to not have enough money to maintain the place in a nice way and it needs some care, but it remains a nice sanctuary.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech522
50,Barnsdall Art Park - Friday night Wine Tasting,"Such an amazing evening for daughter's 21st birthday! Beautiful views, excellent wine tastings, nice tunes in background, the Frank Llyod Wright house was spectacular. We brought a picnic of cheese, crackers, fruit and chocolates to accompany our wine tasting. The tickets were a little pricey ($135 for 4 of us) but we each got 4 smaller glasses/tastes of wine...and truthfully the views and sunset were worth it. I really liked that the money goes to the Art Park. The hill was an oasis in the middle of the bustling city, truly. We found parking right at the top because we got there straight at 5:30. It did get crowded by 6-6:30 so I can see how parking further away and walking may be an issue. I am so glad I found this by doing a google search and wanted to share with all of you looking to do something different/fun in the heart of busy LA!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J0yaA
40,Beautiful picnic with the family!,This park has incredible views of Hollywood and the LA area! It's also a wonderful place for a picnic on the grass by the house! Lots of art and amateur artists sketching and drawing! A nice quiet escape from the busyness of city life!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelaM7103IC
30,Up in the hill,"The Park: Big property. Up in the hill. There is a theater, a museum and retails shops.The Theater: Small theater, no much legroom. They do sell snacks and drinks outside the theater. Sound system is okay. Small stage.The Parking: If there is show going on at the theater, the parking situation can be awful. There is a parking lot on street level but limited parking spots. When you are driving up the hill to the theater or museum, you can park on the side.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILoveFoodComa
50,"Charming, Historic Site!","Few Angelenos are familiar with Barnsdall Park. From the commanding views of Hollywood to the Hollyhock House to the Junior Art Center and Park grounds, this is a beautiful place to spend several hours enjoying the sites and learning about an important period in the cultural history of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/324AnneG
40,Beautiful Experience,"I thought this was a beautiful gem within the city. I was so surprised that this place wasn't crowded! There was beautiful art everywhere, but the highlight of this experience was being able to being able to have a nice romantic picnic in the grass, overlooking the Hollywood skyline. As cheesy as it may sound, it was somewhat of a magical experience to watch the sunset over Hollywood. (QUICK TIP: When researching directions using Apple Maps, type in the name of the park rather than the address as the map will give you the incorrect location...not too far from the actual location, but incorrect nonetheless.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dfntravel
50,a little gem amidst the hustle & bustle,"Hard to put words to explain this little hideaway refuge that insider los angelesians all know to be a secret treasure. This ""park"" houses the hollyhock house by frank lloyd wright, built for Alice Barnsdall, then later donated to the city, but the real secret is the haven-like quality it has maintained all these years. At the top of a winding hill with a non- descript entrance, this is truly a hideaway for the city-weary of Los Feliz, Silverlake, a& Hollywood boasting both the Wright home, which is itself a great treasure (recently refurbished & back in its glory) but also a structure that houses really excellent, cutting edge art exhibits and weekly wine tastings, and another building which offers year round art classes for a nominal fee for both young and old alike. These are truly rare & exceptional level of classes. Registration for classes begins each quarter on a Saturday, but those who travel - literally - many miles to take classes here - will likely gather in the early morning hours to get their number of the line that forms later. It is really a phenomenon to witness so many people coming s early as 3 or 4 in the morning to huddle in the cold to get their preferred class. Many of these are the familiar faces that return regularly to keep their spot ( because they fill quickly).The classes for children are really exceptional, with teachers who understand how kids need time to explore their artistic selves and space in which to make discoveries. During each quarter you will find Moms waiting for their tots to emerge with large grins and happy pieces. With a university offering art classes about a mile away, you need to take in the exceptional community that thrives here nightly, and visit the gallery that displays their works.A must for parents seeking a special setting in which to let their children thrive, and a needed fix for the older adults who've been promising themselves they'd take a class in Printmaking, or jewelry, or clay, or creative writing, or learn to draw or paint, or ukulele!Can't sing their praises enough, and no one will regret finding this gem.And for those who aren't sure if this is for them, go visit, sit amongst the pines and get another view of Los Angeles. Im certain you'll return with your family in tow.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catherinel227
30,Pokemon are here,"We were looking for some things to do around Griffith Park before going to a concert at the Greek and read about Barnsdall Art Park. The place was packed-with young people playing Pokémon Go. The art museum was closed, the Frank Lloyd Wright House was closed and the Hollyhock House has an admission fee. We wandered around the nice shady tree-lined courtyard, but kept running into Pokémon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllyT43

40,Art for All,"Ms Barnsdall's vision to have a place for all to create and be involved in all aspects of Art as each artist sees fit ~ continues to thrive and flourish. She would be so proud that her vision continues. What an exciting place, spectacular grounds, and an inspiring place to show, see, and create art.

50,Hidden Gem,"Situated on the corner of Hollywood and Vermont in East Hollywood lies this gem of a park. Most people come to this area tend to gravitate towards Griffith Park for the Observatory or the numerous hiking trails. Barnsdall may not have an Observatory or acres upon acres of vast wilderness but what Barnsdall offer is an escape for the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles, from the incessant gridlock and overbearing tourist and their selfie sticks.Perch on a little hill is a patch of grass that makes for a perfect picnic and a great spot to see everything Los Angeles has to offer. From the Hollywood Sign to the Griffith Observatory, to views of the downtown skyline to where the sand meets the ocean. There's no better place to view the sun's last glimmer before setting over the horizon and relenting to the dark of night.For architectural buffs, Frank Lloyd Wright's Hollyhock House is a must see, after recently finishing renovations and offering tours.Four legged friends are welcome here, with or without leash.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crabwalk_koala

40,You Get to Visit a Frank Lloyd Wright House,"It was one of those hot days in Los Angeles. The type of day that the soles of your shoes could melt on the hot sidewalk. But there was an oasis just up the road. A place to refresh the body and revive the soul. Barnsdale Art Park.The Barnsdale Art Park is located on a small hill with great views of the Hollywood Hills and all the way to the ocean. On the top fo the hill there is a visitor center, an art museum, a large area with nice, big shade trees, and Frank Lloyd Wright's Hollyhock House. The Hollyhock House is an exceptional house with a design that you won't see in the tract housing that has sprung up throughout the southland. It is a building that was designed to expand your sense of well-being. One cannot find the words or the correct sentence structure to describe this house, so all I will say is that if you have an intrest in architecture, design, or just beauty, you should visit Barnsdale Art Park and the Hollyhock House.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SDHydro
40,A hilltop gem in the middle of Hollywood!,"We came here to see an art exhibit and were quite surprised at Barnsdall Park. It was refreshing to see such a beautiful and hidden place amid such chaos as Hollywood. To get to it, you have to drive up a steep winding road to the top of a large hill that seems out of place with all of its' trees and foliage. Once up top, you can park in any of the parking spaces that line the edge of the road. Parking is free. The park occupies the entire hilltop and features nice grassy lawns, the L.A. Municipal Art Gallery, a children's art school and a number of other buildings. The views of the Hollywood Hills and downtown L.A. are breathtaking on clear days. The park has a number of bathrooms available. The locals come up here to have picnics and just relax, so get here at a decent time in order to get a parking spot. The park can get crowded, so be prepared for little to no parking sometimes. This is due to only a limited amount of parking spaces available around the hill road. Up near the art gallery, there is no grass under the shaded building structure. The park provides maps of the grounds and historical facts via info displays around the park. The day we came here to see the gallery presentation, It was the birthday celebration of Ms. Barnsdall who donated the land to create such a nice park. The artist we came to see, ceremoniously cut the cake. It was a fun time. I recommend a visit to this park if you are in the area, because it is a rare thing to see such a tranquil and bucolic setting in the midst of such congested urban confines. It's worth a look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelrH6268OA
40,"A lovely theater, a nice-sized art gallery, the Hollyhock House, shade trees, and incredible views.","Barnsdall Park has a lot to offer to the local patron as well as to the interested tourist. We went to see the most recent art exhibit because a friend had been awarded ""Best of Show"". We were impressed, not only with her interactive installation, but with the variety of work displayed throughout the gallery. The exhibit is free and the docents are very eager to share information about the current artists as well as future displays. It's a lovely setting on a hill-top in the heart of the city with magnificent views, including the famous Hollywood sign and the historic Griffith Park Observatory. We ran out of time, so we will have to return to tour Frank Lloyd Wright's Hollyhock House.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tbmegowan

It will be leaving LAMAG soon and returning to Hawaii where it will open at the Honolulu Museum of Art in February. The gallery is very supportive of local and emerging artists.

The building from Frank Lloyd Wright is amazing, the grounds are so beautiful and peaceful. And parking is free!If this was not enough, there is also an awesome farmer's market on Wednesdays. It is small but cute and definitely not crowded or loud. Not all of the stuff is organic, but it still worth a stop. You can get some delicious food and have it up hill while enjoying the amazing views, The amaranth tortilla chips were to die for and so were the vegan treats! You can also still park for free on Wednesdays!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanMD73

40,An awesome space!,"This place is amazing! And I grew up in LA and never new about it. It is obviously a place that once was thriving and has the potential to again, only if it were better taken care of. Just gorgeous views of Hollywood, nice grassy areas with beautiful trees, several art buildings full of life with kids playing instruments and doing their art. We visited for a fundraiser event that was catered on an upper level grassy area and we retired to the theater for a gospel performance. The weather was great and we all had a great time. I would love to have such a space near my home for my kids to be culturally educated. I hate to see lack of funding for the arts and wish that it was better taken care of. There are alot of vagabonds that have taken over the space which don't bother me at all, but may to some. I will definitely visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dexter619
40,A hidden gem,"We came here one early afternoon. I have passed by this park a few times not realizing that it is a wonderful place to go to for a quick fix of peace and tranquility... The view is awesome... You can see the Hollywood sign and Griffith park museum from atop. To bad there was no art display on the day we went. The hollyhock house was closed too, but just looking at the facade of the place gives you a sense of how forward thinking they were the time it was built in terms of architecture. I would love to comeback maybe early morning or late afternoon when the sun is about to set.. I can imagine how the view would look like... Though there is ample parking at the street level, park your car on top! And you can drive by the whole place as you leave...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tameia
