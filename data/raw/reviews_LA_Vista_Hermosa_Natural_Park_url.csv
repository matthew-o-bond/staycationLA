50,Wonderful California wilderness just a short distance from Downtown Los Angeles,"It's been 10 years since Vista Hermosa Natural Park has opened. It is planted with native California trees and vegetation that now have matured to the point that when you walk through this park, you can easily forget that you are so close to downtown Los Angeles with its massive high-rise buildings. Even from the highest elevations of the park, the high-rise buildings are very well out of the sightlines except for a few locations. It is a peaceful place and is also restful. A great place to escape the City, if even for a few minutes or hours. This is a great little park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech522
50,"Gorgeous, magical slice of California ""wilderness"" in the city","This park feels much larger than its size due to it's brilliant landscape design. The rolling hills, generous plantings, and blue sky views make you feel like you've stumbled into a forest in the middle of the city. There is a lovely boulder and waterfall area, where kids love to frolic and a Gaudi-esque ""play"" area made up of large, cement structures in the shape of a turtle and snake. It's a playground without a ""jungle gym"" and the kiddos love it.It's a great place to picnic, with lots of grassy meadows and many benches and picnic tables scattered about. Be sure to visit Bob Baker's Marionette Theatre (just a block away).Wishing you love and romance,Aviva Vaughnauthor of slow burn women's fiction inspired by food, travel, and Jane Austen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AvivaVaughnAuthor
50,Great urban park,"I first came to this parking overlooking downtown Los Angeles soon after it opened in 2008. I happened to see a story in the Los Angeles Times — still available if you search online — that told how this was the first public park opened in the city since 1895.Only a third of Angelenos live within a quarter-mile of a park, compared with 97 percent of Bostonians and 91 percent of New Yorkers. It was great to see this park pop up in a lower-income part of Los Angeles.The 10-acre park was built on an old oil field. It was constructed with conservation in mind and includes native plants, meadows, ponds and a 20,000-gallon cistern that recycles water for use in irrigation.The giant models of snakes and turtles that kids can climb on were built with help from prop artists from the movie industry.It's a great place to capture views of downtown and just to relax.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sowellman
40,Strange little park in the middle of Los Angeles,"This new park, although nice, seems strangely out of place. It's a few blocks away from the tall downtown buildings of Los Angeles. It's planted with California native trees and brush, making one feel like one is exploring the coastal foothills along Malibu. It's quiet and very uncrowded (we were there on a Saturday and there were only a few people walking around.) There are areas that are like meadows with nice grass growing. There is also a small area for children to play in. Fortunately, when we were there, there were no homeless around (a real big problem anywhere near downtown LA),Apparently, this place was originally disignated for a school...they discovered some type of oil pollution on the site and coudln't build it. Luckily, for us, they decided to turn it into a park.There is no parking lot...only street parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rogerdob
50,Engagement pics,Great place to take pictures with the view of downtown la! There's grassy area to play or have a picnic. If you go into the park there is a bench you can sit at which overlooks dtla. Great Instagram pic shot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ailienv01
40,Nice pleasant getaway from the sounds and bustle of LA!,"We wanted to stroll in a park after breakfast, so we went to this park to relax and talk! Plenty of shade under a tree and very tranquil in spite of being so close to downtown. Good views of downtown from a bench!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelaM7103IC
50,Hidden Gem,"I have lived in Los Angeles all my life and have driven by this place countless times. I am so glad I finally made it a point to visit this gorgeous hidden gem. There are so many great areas to picnic, exercise, play, and hang out. Really beautiful photo ops are a plus!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OLlady78
50,Glad we stopped,This block was once run down and used in several movies as it worked great for gritty shots with DTLA in the background. When I saw it had been turned into a park I had to check it out. Very impressive! Clean and uncrowded with very good views of the city skyline. Definitely great for short hikes and picnics.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bsmed
50,Lovely neighborhood park,"Lovely refuge from the concrete jungles of downtown la. You also get lovely views of dtla when you hike to the top. The park looks larger than what it really is but it's so pleasant here and worth the trip. There's a soccer field next to the restrooms. Once you cross the parking lot in front, there is an additional side lot and a visitor center closer to Douglas. The paved trail goes up in both directions (north and south) to lead to the top of the park where there's a nice field to kick a ball around or sit at one of the benches and enjoy the views or have a picnic. There's also a cool kids playground that has a nice mat to keep the kids from falling and cracking their heads on concrete. There's also a dirt trail so you can feel like it's a mini get away with a mini hike. This park is very well maintained and lots of different plants, flowers, and trees to admire. Thank goodness for a little slice of greenery in this smog filled city!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelinh1
