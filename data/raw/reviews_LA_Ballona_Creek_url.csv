40,"Great for Bike Rides, but be Careful.","I live right near Ballona Creek. It is great to bike ride on. It is really nothing more than a bike path. Some jog and walk there and I don't think that wise. This area is known for predators waiting to take advantage of someone not paying attention to what they are doing. Also, I would never bike this area at night. Some do, and that is a choice. If you are not from here, I really would stick to the bike path on the beach at night.The creek bike path is pretty. It goes on for miles and you can connect from there to the beach and into Culver City to the east. You can catch it off Centinela near Braddock or closer to the beach near Washington Blvd.There are egrets and herons to see and when we have had a big rain (rare) the creek has water in it (this is a man made creek and nothing to look at in wonder). What I like about the creek bike path is I don't have to worry about getting hit by car on the main streets near Culver City and the beach (Venice Beach).If you want to enjoy the creek bike path, just pay attention. Don't have your headphones on so loud that you can't hear someone approaching. Chances are you will be fine, but there have been robberies and no one wants that. Just stay on your bike and you will be fine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
30,When nature is lacking,"Of course, the fence takes and all bans give one to understand that this is something Marina del Ray spent a lot of money on to create. For the bird-interested, it is possible to see some species worth viewing.For most, it's something you'll pass as fast as possible on jogging or cycling. Tragic to see so many wind-driven existences in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phayao13
40,Better Bike ride than walking.,8 miles one way down the Balona Creek waterway. Other than the enormous amounts of trash you see in the water and shoreline in places its a good ride. After the ride you will never drink another thing in a Styrofoam cup.!....ever.!!!...Plenty of birds and some marine life. End with a jetty walk or ride at the ocean which is nice. Side trip south of Venice and North of Dockwhieler. Some parking available.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/695judj
40,egrets and herons,"Walked the path to the jetty many times over 30 years, living nearby. The fog drenched am is magical. love most the egrets and herons.A cherished slice of real biology along the pacific fly way. Wetlands are teaming with life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dziran
50,I can't live without Ballona!,I cycle the full length 2-3 times a week. It is my lifeline to the ocean. I feel so grateful to have a bike path like this completely separate from cars. When I was running more I used to do various lengths depending on my training schedule. It is rarely crowded but there are some bottlenecks when Culver City schools get out in the afternoon so you have to weave around kids. Yay Bayona!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pinglet
40,Nice Area for Bicycling and Volunteering,The area around Ballona Creek is pleasant for bicycle trips. It offers a nice opportunity to enjoy everything that nature has to offer from sea lions to white egrets. Different environmental groups offer volunteer opportunities for cleanups around the creek to pick up trash around the site. It's a nice way to meet great people while doing something good for nature.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debralynnet
10,filthy,"This area is disgusting.Crime,druggies,gang bangers & the dregs of the LA storm drain dystem.Very dangerous after dark. Cyclists have often been mugged & robbed. .NO police presence.Avoid the area after dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Painless123
10,Dangerous place to bike,Cyclists have been mugged here. More and more unsavory people are coming here. The people that ride here often do not observe the basic rules of the road. Do not ride alone near or after sundown.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spahopper123
50,"Not accessible on foot, but you can bike past it","This is a wetland preserve, so it's not a place to ""visit"" but there's a bike path along the creek that is very peaceful and allows a great way to view some of the wildlife without disturbing the habitat",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/858abbyn
50,Bike trails are the way to go!,"I love being able to safely ride my bike along the ocean all the way from Manhattan Beach up to Marina del Rey and then onward to the Ballona Creek trail. It gives such a sense of freedom to be away from the insane traffic, knowing that my doggy can ride in my bike basket with no worries of crazy drivers whizzing by! Kudos to those who fought/planned to preserve the Ballona Wetlands and create this beautiful trail for bikers, walkers and runners to enjoy! Thank you for this! I feel so lucky to live close enough to enjoy this incredible scenery any time I want to. For those visiting the area, you can rent bikes in Marina del Rey or down in Manhattan/Hermosa/Redondo Beach. It's TOTALLY worth it to experience the salty air in your face and the views of water and other happy Trekkers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SallyM265
50,Awesome ride!,"I usually begin this ride from Culver City, then end up in Marina Del Rey. From the beginning of the path in Culver City, there is ample amount of parking at the MEtro stop on Jefferson and La Cienega. Then the ride to the marina is just awesome. There are parts that are a bit jerky, however it is clean, and the other riders are respectful of space and speed.Towards the end of the ride, you can take a left and end up in the Marina and continue on to Venice Beach. Or, you can stay straight and go into Dockweiler State Beach. Either are great destinations.Again this review is from the perspective of beginning in Culver City.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/june_b0t
50,Great path for a walk or a ride,This is a path for the leisurely walker or biker. It offers some great views of the ocean in Playa del Rey or the Ballona Creek. Go for a leisurely stroll.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/too_few_trips_1
40,Go Car-less in LA!,"This is one of the nicest bike routes in the city, which is not to say its really pretty, I mean, it's still LA. Nice thing is it is free from dangerous interactions with traffic. It's great during the day, and not many people use it because people in LA don't bike or walk very much. As of this writing, you can ride from the ocean to culver city in 30-40 minutes with minimal uphill, from there you can hop on the expo line and a 30 minute train ride will get you downtown (train is often empty since people in LA don't ride public transit). It's a great way to go experience LA ""car-less"". Be advised that the further you go up the river, the more graffiti and homeless people you will encounter. Best not to ride alone or after sundown. One man was attacked by men trying to steal his bike in 2013, but this is not a regular occurrence.Lots of sea life along the river, especially near the marina. Look for great blue herons, oyster catchers, and sea lions off the jetty. Head towards the end of the jetty and go south to visit Playa Del Rey, which is a non-touristy neighborhood with great mom & pop eateries and bars. Senor Gs mexican is awesome. Go north (you have to cut around the marina) to ride up the beach bike path through Venice and Santa Monica, but these areas are often very crowded with tourists and every flavor of California weirdo.Ride safe!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamjstephens
40,Nicer part of Venice beach,"Beautiful homes and views of the oceon outside of the Marina. Not much activity, but great for walking on the beach and watching the sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hsvboy1
40,Great outdoor experience for the entire family,A full environmental interactive learning experience. Great fun while you learn. Provides a wonderful outing for the family. Better than an amusement park!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RUQAYYAHC
20,Dangerous,People have been attacked along this route. Carry a gun. The scenery is nothing impressive. Would not recommend this route,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lzzzz
40,Good for a day trip bike ride,Wonderful place to get away from the crowds of MdR. Rent a bike or just take a stroll. the Marina has a lot of nice restaurants to choose from.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tj4diving
30,Not an exciting area,The area around Ballona Creek is limited and it is not a site that I would tell tourists to be sure to see. It is a small outdoor area that does not offer a lot to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
40,It's ok.,"I'm not a super nature lover, so I think it is just ok. I prefer Malibu or Santa Monica Mountains for my nature loving moments when I have them. It is an estuary filled with wild life and is often in need of crew cleaning due to illegal dumping which is a shame. Efforts are underway to rehabilitate wildlife. Call them to volunteer!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeahB627
40,"I like riding my bike and jogging, and occasionally walking on the path","I like the path for exercise. I have used the path for cycling, jogging, and walking. I have done it when its dark, but maybe its better done in the daylight though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/184MikeC
40,Protected Environment,Finally a part of LA which is protected and cannot be developed enjoy it while it lasts until the next Pres. gives the greenlight to destroy it like Clinton did for part of it when he was in office,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalGoneLocal
40,Great bike trail to Playa del Rey Beach,I love this trail that I catch of Culver Blvd. (near Direct TV and Ronnie's Cafe) I take it all the way down to PDR. Along the way there are many marine birds including the magnificent blue herons and white egrets. There used to me a stunning row of rock sculptures along the bike path but perhaps the high tide knocked some of them down. I hope it was mindless people bent on destruction. I love the smell of the ocean as you get closer to the water. Seeing all the trash in the creek is sad. People should realize that when they litter they pollute the ocean and endanger our marine life!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happytrails31283
40,The weekend walking tours never fail to impress,Everytime I do one of their Saturday or Sunday morning tours I am more and more amazed at how beautiful this area is and how important its preservation is!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeWalker
40,Unique,"Very peaceful, and an enviornmental gem. Some parts are not open to the public, but I was fortunate enough to explore the area",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Quarterdeck
40,Beautiful Area!,"Several years ago, I used to ride my bike every weekday morning from Culver City all the way to the end of the Ballona Creek bike path and back. It was really energizing and peaceful. It's a wonderful way to start the day.When I was riding, there was one area that made me a bit uncomfortable because other riders were few and far between. I never had any problems, however.Now, there are more riders and security cameras have been installed as well as emergency call boxes along the path. As a precaution, it's always best to bring your cell phone with you and to be aware of your surroundings. Enjoy the beauty, fresh air and sunshine, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JSW842
40,Worth a walk,Great for birders -- and one of the few wild spots in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NW_Raven
50,Back to Nature!,"I had not been back to this area for a long time, but was very impressed with the preservation efforts that have been made to keep this area in it's original natural state. Probably not everyone will share my view, but I think it deserves a visit if you're in the area and dressed for exploring a marshy preserve.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amercorp

50,How to bike to the beach with no traffic,"The Ballona Creek bike path is one of the great biking secrets of Los Angeles. Starting at the Syd Kronenthal Park on National Road in east Culver City, it is a class 1 bike path (no cars allowed) that extends about 7 miles to the beach in Marina Del Rey. (From there, you can connect up with the Coast Bike Path that will take you north to Santa Monica or south to Redondo Beach.) The path follows along the Ballona Creek flood control channel, which some may dismiss as ugly, but which hosts an amazing array of birds. On my many rides along the path, I always see herons, egrets, gulls, ducks, cormorants, coots, terns, and pelicans. But for me, the real appeal of the path is that I can ride from Culver City to the beach on a well maintained concrete path, with no stop signs and NO CARS! It doesn't get better than that.Just two warnings.#1 - the prevailing wind comes out of the west, so be prepared to fight a headwind when you are going towards the beach - particularly in the afternoon. But you are also almost assured of having a good tailwind when you make your return to Culver City.#2 - Parts of the trail can feel very deserted, so use good sense in when you ride the trail. I prefer not to ride the trail in the evening, but during the day, when you will have lots of company from other bikers and runners, be sure to get out and enjoy this hidden gem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TwoWheelExplorer
50,Workout fun,"We took the walking path around the marina on a Sunday morning. It offers interesting views of the wildlife and the marina itself, as well as being long enough to offer quite a workout. Bikers abound but they stay in the bike lanes so it's not problem. The little shops and restaurants in Fisherman's Village are charming and not too cutesy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizajane47
