50,If your interested in early Rail Transportation in Southern California this is for you!,"My daughter just recently moved to San Dimas and spotted this little museum as she got acquainted with the area. On our first visit she surprised me by on a Saturday morningTaking me to this great little Railroad Museum. As luck would have it the curator was there and gave us a personalized guided tour!What a walking encyclopedia he is of Southern California Railroad History..Ended up staying nearly two hours as he showed us every corner of the museum and its great library .Lots of history of course on the early Santa Fe and Union Pacific and all sorts of interesting material on the Los Angeles Inter-Urban Railway called the Pacific Electric, who at its peak was the nations largest electric railway with over 1,000 miles of track and 2,200 daily trains..

50,Charming small museum that packs in a lot of history.,"I enjoyed this museum with friends and family. The staff is friendly and passionate about trains. A nice surprise was the train related culinary history highlighting the dining car experience and showcasing the different dinner service, menus, and recipes served on different regional lines. This information was available in displays with more details in books they have. Plus, I love the different designs of trains and the lines past, present, and as rail re-emerges...future.",RMMcD
50,Small Museum Gem,"A friend and I stopped in here to do a geocache that involves finding info inside the museum and found ourselves interested in a number of the exhibits. This small museum is chock full of great information and memorabilia on the golden age of rail service in the American southwest. I was particularly pleased to find displays on the Harvey Girls and Mary Colter, subjects I became interested in on an earlier trip to Arizona. David is the curator and I doubt there is much about railroads that he doesn’t know. It is great to see the San Dimas depot preserved and serving in such an appropriate capacity. As small, local museums go, this one is very well done. If local history or the history of trains and railroads is your thing then don’t miss this little gem. And if you are a goecacher, be sure to leave enough time to explore before racing off in search of a much less interesting find.",fincaran

40,Nice local museum to take the kids to.,"The Pacific Railroad Museum is a small train museum in the heart of the charming town of San Dimas, California. Located in the original train station about 25 miles west of Los Angeles, it has been nicely arranged for those who love train history. Although small, it is especially good to take your kids and grands to introduce them to the history of railroads in America, and how they served smaller communities.",Richard A

50,interesting and informative,"I was planning to simply take a glimpse of the exhibitions in this museum. But finally I spent almost the whole afternoon there until it closed on 4 pm. A small museum, but you can find a lot of interesting details in the history if you dig in a little bit. Including how things works at old time, old pictures that show you what the depot looked like back to early 20th century, and very neat train models. The guides are really helpful, warmhearted, patient and knowledgeable. Since not many people came to visit this little spot on Saturday afternoon, I got a good chance to communicate with the guides. I really appreciate it.",泽冯
