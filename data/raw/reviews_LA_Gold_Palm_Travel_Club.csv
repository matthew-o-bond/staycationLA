50,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Tour of Los Angeles,"If you want to experience the culture of LA this is the perfect tour. First, the car: it’s stunning and in pristine condition. People were complimenting us wherever we went. The tour: Malibu, Topanga, Agora Hills area, stopping at many local spots including the Paramount Ranch, with the top down. We saw many cool places we didn’t know existed, with a knowledgeable and enthusiastic guide. Enrico was a great driver, full of information and so much fun. 5⭐️S!",Catherine G
50,Excellent experience ...,"Enry was a sensational enthusiast, detailed local connoisseur, full of suggestions, engaging us, in the history and local gossip ...Visiting a new or foreign city it's all having context ...My suggestion is to do a tour with him as soon as you fly to LA, so the rest of your trip will be perfect ...We are still amazed how much, we learned and explored in such brief time ...",Max Busato
