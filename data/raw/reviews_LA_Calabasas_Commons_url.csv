40,Very Nice Visit On A Sunny Day,"My wife and I used to live in Calabasas in the early 1880's when this whole area was just a pumkin field of sorts and you needed to venture out in the valley in order to dine and shop. Now you can just go here for a large food supermarket, drugstore, bookstore and dinning(about six places to eat...some very good), shops and a movie theater. On our visit there was an art fair going on which made for a nice stroll around. Because of the changes going on in California we hold the view that the folks that live in the area could be a captive audience due to traffic, safety and other issues. As pretty as it is, we are soo happy to have relocated to Scottsdale, Arizona but it is always nice to visit and observe the changes going on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardS778

I have never seen anything like this and we just sat and enjoyed watching this beautiful creatures enjoy the water and sun. This shopping center was wonderful and had a variety of places to shop, but it is small so if you’re looking for shops for everyone in the family, you may want to go to a local shopping mall.

30,The Only Game In Town,"My wife and I lived in Calabasas at Vista Pointe when this area was a field of dirt in the 1980's. Now it is a shopping, entertainment(one movie theater) and dinning venue. It is limited in scope with a bunch of shops, a food market(Ralph's) a CVS, coffee shops, and about a half dozen places to eat or dine. We stayed at the Hilton Garden inn within very easy walking distance away so it is easy from that point of view with no driving on the congested and crazy roads and crazy drivers. Our view is since we moved out of LA to Arizona that if we still lived here we would be held hostage to this area due to the massive changes that have taken place in The LA area.

50,Makes for a nice Toddler Outing,"Since my son was very little we have been going to the Calabasas commons. He is now three years old and it's a nice place to go to get out of the house for an afternoon that is not a full day commitment like a zoo or when you're tired of going to the park every day.While there are plenty of stores and I'm sure everyone's experience is different… We have a routine. We start by going to Barnes and Noble where we first visit the kids room. Then he'll look at the toys section… And we and by getting a treat in the café.Next, we visit the little pond where they have tons of turtles! Literally I've counted over 100 turtles! There are also big beautiful fish, and a bunch of water fountains which is my sons favorite thing! We spent some time looking at the turtles, and then it's up to the Calabasas Library that is right up the path! We visit the kids room there and check out some books. There are you going to water fountains at the library!That's a typical visit for us! Sometimes instead of Barnes & Noble we'll go to Menchi's. I enjoyed the five at the Calabasas commons. They always play vintage Frank Sinatra style music which is pretty cool. This isn't Disneyland, but it's a place that has been bringing me back for years, so I think that alone is deserving of five stars. Enjoy!If you want to make more of a day of it, start by checking out the Leonis adobe not far away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage

White House/Black Market and Chicos, along with a new Kate Spade store keep it interesting to shop. There is actually a Barnes and Nobles that is always packed and has a fantastic coffee bar inside. It's a nice place to stroll down in the evening, with duck and turtles playing in the fountains. Marmalade is one of my favorite places for a quick bite.

The unusual architecture, trees, and structure of the place were nothing like the soul-less corporate feel of most such places, even the high-end ones. It was almost fun to be there.

(Even the trash receptacles are pretty! They have a copper color trim and are clean)Happy jazz music, fountains, Italian string lights make this a festive place no matter what time of year.They could do with more songs to rotate, i think I counted 12 songs rotating and repeating all day lol, but nonetheless, the place is fun and the vibrant jazz makes you feel like dancing down the streets. :) There are great cafes, a fantastic looking Barnes and Noble, a movie theatre, specialty shops, and a Ralph's Market and a Rite Aid. There are a few specialty kiosks as well. Pet friendly place to walk your dogs. The best feature is the water feature, near Marmalade and Toscanova.

On almost every trip there I see people using handicapped spaces who do not have handicap stickers/signs and who are not handicapped.One young woman used 2 handicapped spaces so she could go into the dry cleaner... and had to walk by the security guard both ways.

40,You can spend all day at the Commons!,"I recently had some time to visit the Commons; lots of things to do there. It is located off the 101 in Calabasas around the corner from the historic and wonderful Leonis Adobe (very easy walking distance for a NY'er and there was only one other person walking when I was exploring the area which is a shame since it is a wonderful area to enjoy). You can take in a movie, get your hair done at the Aveda salon, enjoy books at the Barnes and Noble, get a cup of coffee and a bite to eat or something more filling at one of the wonderful restaurants, etc. etc. You can also visit the Calabasas library which is behind the Commons; their friends' bookstore always has wonderful treasures and this being LA, you can sometimes find old movie/TV shows scripts (no, I haven't found any super treasures but I am always hopeful since I love history and old films!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BZM_13

50,Great meeting place,"Lots of coffee, yogurt, general restaurants, a supermarket, cosmetic store, drugstore, etc. I frequent Marmalade and will frequent the newly added Sugar Fish sushi restaurant. The Corner Bakery is fun and King's Fish House is nice for an upscale dinner. Parking is usually good unless there is a blockbuster at the Edwards theatre. Also a great place just to visit and relax, with their pond which has the largest number of turtles ever.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Artsy12
50,Visit the koi and turtles :-),"This is an open-air mall, with some very nice restaurants and some high-end boutiques. At the far end is a great water feature, with waterfalls, sculptures of kids playing in a ""Pirate's Cove"" and lots of large , colorful koi fish and dozens of aquatic turtles. There are four sculpture, representing the Four Seasons, that were imported from Europe. The shops include Barnes & Nobel, Williams Sonoma, Starbucks and even a Ralphs grocery. One of my favorite seafood restaurants, King's Fish House,"" sits atop a waterfall, elevated from the street. There are lots of nice garden areas and there is music piped outdoors. It's charming and definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ambersea
50,Have loved it from the beginning,"What a great addition this was to the Calabasas community when it was built so many years ago by Caruso. I love the Ralph's and it is one of my main ""go stores"". The restaurants, with the exception of King's, are excellent. There are many small stores that we frequent on a regular basis. The programs they put on for the kids are terrific. It is like this small town within the big cities that surround us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RussB735
50,"River, Sculpture garden, living turtles and frogs!","Right in the middle of downtown Calabasas is a small romantic shopping center with absolutely world-class design, landscape architecture.Cannot imagine how anybody could so effectively integrate a little shopping center, specialized restaurants and coffee shops, and a river that is so beautiful that you could almost shift into another dimension.Children will love looking at all of the turtles and frogs in the river and on the banks.Complements to everybody involved with this presentation. Las Vegas quality in a small villag in the in the West Valley.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheSwedishBeaver
