40,Take the shuttle,Traffic is horrrendous. So many cars and buses. Easy enough to get to if you take a shuttle but make sure when you exit the shuttle to ask where you drop your luggage. We almost missed it and a bunch of others did miss it.Lots of workers around to ask where to drop it or just ask the shuttle driver.,pspoker
50,Great Terminal,Great Cruise Terminal! Large with lots of room. Didn't feel crammed in with others. Embarkation was quick and easy. Staff was friendly and helpful.,Selena A
50,Excellent First Cruise Experience,I was unsure how smooth the boarding process would be for the cruise I took with family in February. The terminal is laid out very well and the boarding process took us a short amount of time. I definitely would look forward to sailing out of Long Beach again.,SassyKat_10
50,Very efficient,I have taken about 7-8 trips over the last several years from here. Each time is more efficient than the last. The terminal schedule of boarding is among the more accommodating. The parking garage is located extremely conveniently. The cost as of February 2020 is $23.00 per day.Lesson learned: if you have misplaced your parking arrival ticket you can use your ship boarding pass when leaving.,Aneita G
40,Love the dinosaurs,The cranes lining the shipping terminal are something to see. Our cruise ship was docked just ahead of the Iowa Battleship and our cabin overlooked those big guns.,KenFromIllinois
40,Cruising from San Pedro,Easy access from LAX overnight before cruise departure. About 1 hour Uber ride from airport hotel overnight and $30 ride. Large efficient terminal with pleasant waiting area. Within walking distance opportunity to tour retired naval ship.,742judithl
30,"Nice place, poor organization","The terminal has been very nicely remodeled. However, on February 1st, it was exceptionally poorly run!!! Priority guests had to stand outside while waiting. It seemed as if it was the first receiving guests! There was only h20 with tiny little paper cones in the VIP waiting area...No snacks as usual. Once we start boarding, one associate tells you to go one way and another questions you as to why you're 'here' instead of 'over there'!!! Very Poorly organized!!!",TheSupremeQueen
50,Well Organized,"We have cruised out of this terminal several times in the past. We just finished a cruise last week and it was the best embarkation process we have been involved in at this terminal. We had preregistered online, and from the time we parked the car in the garage at the terminal until we were on board the Panorama was approximately 20 minutes. The check in process was very organized and professional.",Steve F
50,Carnival panorama,Went through Terminal for Panorama cruise. Clean and well organized. In and out efficiently. They had help for people with disabilities. Parking was difficult for most but I arrived early. Porters we helpful and knowledge.,Rebecca G
50,Easy to manuever,"It was so easy to get in and out, and most of all, to get an Uber. It's very organized, and is a pleasant surprise after going out of other terminals.",beth ann k
50,Seemless experience,"Just returned from a cruise on Carnival Panorama. We usually depart from Miami, so this was a new experience for us. The check-in process was very smooth and organized. The lines moved very fast as there were many agents checking in passengers. It was the most painless check-in process I have ever experienced, which made the start of our trip so pleasant.",Nikky F
50,Great!,"This was easy and fast. Wide open, with a ton of nice people willing to point you straight to and from the boat. Simple.",Krysblair
40,We boarded a cruise ship; the terminal is excellent organized,"We arrived by taxi near the ship at the terminal. We unloaded the baggage - 3 luggages - and immediately a porter was here and took care of the bag. the terminal is very good organized, everythins is very clear and staff very helpful. boarding the ship - including customs and security - was a smooth process.",Daniel Fueglister
40,"Very efficient operation, with friendly, helpful staff.","We have cruised through the Long Beach terminal twice in the past couple of years, and each time found it better organized than other terminals we have used. Each time, the porters, TSA and Customs teams to be efficient and helpful.We also stayed each time at the adjacent Queen Mary hotel, and used the nearby water taxis to cross the bay and visit the touristy shops and restaurants. Overall a pleasant experience. The only downside is the industrial atmosphere that dominates the area, with big cranes and shipping containers blocking one's view of the ocean.",Charles W
50,A Cruise Out of the Long Beach Terminal is Easy and Fast,The best cruise check in experience we have ever had. The terminal is fast and efficient and I highly recommend a cruise out of Long Beach!,steve g
40,Most times very organized.,If you cruise it is certain that you will have an unexpected long check in sometimes.The more you cruise the more likely this will happen. I have cruised out of the terminal many times and for the most part these guys are efficient and very organized. This is a nice place to cruise from as the parking lot is easy to park in and or get a ride from.,David R
50,Fast Service,Not knowing what to expect since this was my first time going on a cruise and using a cruise terminal was very surprised how fast the people get you on the ship. They are very kind and courteous. I would say we waited maybe 5 to 10 minutes and off to the ship we went. Keep up the good work!,Noel C
50,"Quick, Quick, Quick!","We have used 8 different cruise terminals in our past, and this was by far the fastest. Traffic into the terminal is not easy, even with only one ship, and I was certainly glad that I was not driving, but from the time our feet touched the ground it was ""highballing' the rest of the way.",Randy S
40,Great parking area next to Carnival Cruise departures,"This is the perfect spot to park if you are going on a Carnival Cruise out of Long Beach. Easy in and out, about $20/day. Baggage handlers available for loading and unloading. Would use this place again and again.",Robert H
50,Quick boarding of Carnival,"This was the fastest we were ever able to embark on a cruise. Since only one ship comes in at a time you only have one terminal so the traffic isn't crazy. Parking, shuttles, and bus service were all handy. They let people into the dome way before the time on our boarding pass. We were on the ship eating at the buffet about an hour before our assigned boarding time. (We stayed at the Queen Mary that has 11 am check out and just walked across the parking lot to board.",Becky H
40,Ease and speed,I thought embankment was very quick just taking a few minutes once inside terminal. Not sure why they have made a terminal that looks like something from outta space and huge roof which is not utilised. Disembarkment tool around 10 minutes to go through passport control.,Ivess3
50,Infinitely Better than Galveston,"Despite Galveston being a much higher profile cruise terminal for Carnival than Long Beach, our experience here was a completely different universe, by comparison, both arriving and departing.The facility itself is simply nicer, better appointed, better laid out, and radically more organized. If anything they almost have too many staff available to be helpful.Best of all, the line for passing through Customs on one's return from a trip is a single file process ensuring FCFS to the next available agent rather than the roll-of-the-dice-hope-I-don't-get-stuck-behind-someone-declaring-$8000-in-gold-coins situation you face at Galveston which has burned us more times than we can count.",jimjohnmarks
50,4 Day Cruise,"We scheduled a family and friends cruise of about 40 people because my neice got married on Catalina Island. We've taken this cruise many times; it goes to Catalina Island and Ensenada Mexico. The crew are all extremely customer focused, the food is awesome, entertainment that careers to ask ages and these hard working members, remember your name. I can't give this cruiseline enough positive feedback; it was a great experience. I even won $500 in a slot tournament! Thank you Carnival Cruiseline's for a wonderful vacation!",Ray B
50,Cruise Terminal getaway,The Cruise Terminal was very clean got through their very quick from the parking was good pulled right in got a parking spot on the first floor. Got in the terminal went straight in they checked our paperwork took less than 2 minutes and on we went to board the boat. They were all very nice. It was a painless experience. And it was our first time going on a Cruise so we didn't know what to expect so everything went smooth.,Mel L
50,Highly Efficient and Secure,We were able to move quickly through the terminal. Everyone had a smile and a few good words. This was a very painless experience.,BrasilTraveler
50,Dome Cruise Terminal - Faster to the Fun package helped me to getaway fun for 3 days to Enchilada Mexico,"First time ever ship cruise for me. Met at LAX airport baggage terminal by helpful Carnival Cruise coordinator and transported to the Long Beach Cruise Terminal. I had purchased the Faster To The Fun (FTTF) add on package $49.95 which entitles your cabin (1-4 people) to priority boarding and disembarking any time you like. I'm glad i did this because the other 2500 or so cruise passengers have to wait for their time slot to board, a 3 to 5 hour process. I boarded at 12pm after the Platinum and Diamond members on the morning of departure, went to my room immediatley and picked up my plastic key card in an envelope at the room door and then ate delicious burgers at one of the restaurants. My bag was at the room by 1.30pm. I had a wonderful cruise. Friendly staff, good vibes, great music everywhere, fantastic shows, excellant musicians in the various bar areas and the food was mind blowing. I put on 5 kgs. I packed my bag the night before we arrived back in Long Beach and left it outside my door before 11pm. This was ready for me when I disembarked. With my FTTF card I went to the customer services desk and they allowed me to disembark immediately through the Platinum and Diamond members line. After I collected my bag, the carnival cruise transport (paid service) took me to LAX to fly back to New Zealand. A wonderful time.I'm doing another cruise within a year, Thanks Carnival!",terangi706
40,Looks quite modern,We had a look at the Terminal when we came out on the Passport Bus to see the Queen Mary that sits next door to the terminal.Looks modern and I think only accommodates Carnival Cruise Ships. Looks like getting on and off here would be smooth and quick .We finished a cruise a couple of weeks ago with another cruise company and came in at a different terminal.,roy v
50,Carnival Splendor,"Had a great experience leaving and returning to this port via Carnival Cruise. Flew into Long Beach Airport, stayed overnight in town then shuttled to terminal. Check in and departure was effortless. Plenty of cabs, uber's, Lyft's and hotel shuttles. Enjoy",chris m
50,Setting Sail from here a breeze,We departed our Carnival Cruise from this port and accessing the port by vehicle was very easy as was getting onto the ship.We had wanted to walk from the downtown hub but was advised against it due to the distance and inconvenience of foot bridges or pedways.,grouchycritic
40,Carnival Cruise,"Carnival cruise line uses this terminal.Check-in: On your boarding pass, it will show your assigned check-in time. You can pay extra to be on the ""proriity"" line. The check-in starts at 10:30am. Check-in process super easy, they scan your boarding pass & passport then issue you a zone number for boarding. After that, security check your luggage. Once on board, your cabin number is already pre-assigned on your boarding pass so you may go straight to your cabin (after 1:30pm), the room key is on the mailbox right outside the cabin.Internet: They do offer differet options of data plans. Either just social media or email only or both. You can either buy daily plan or whole trip. If you download their app and pay $5, you can use the app messenger service.Activities: Download Carnival Hub app. You don't need to buy data plan on boat to use their app. They list daily activities, where to eat (some even with menu), ship map, account statement summary, etc. Very user friendly and convenient.Parking: Just pick up & drop off within 30 minutes - FREE. Parking overnight at the stucture right next to the pier, $20 per day.",ILoveFoodComa
50,Helpful & Easy,Really helpful with everything vs me trying to get five suitcases onto the boat. They also help me with my grandma.,Jeni
