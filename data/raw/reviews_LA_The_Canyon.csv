50,Air Supply concert 02/21/2020 was a fantastic show in a fantastic venue....,"The Canyon helped in every manner requested. We needed handicap seating for our parents. Done. We wanted food accommodations. Done. Lance was our contact at The Canyon, and he was able to negotiate our every need. Because of Lance, we now intend to make this venue a staple of our frequent trip to Southern California. Thank you, guys. See you this summer for the Marshall Tucker Band....",assessmenttraini2016
10,Don’t let them rip you off,"Attended a concert. Told dinner purchase required, those that arrived late did not have to buy dinner. If you go here do not let them force you to purchase food or drinks. Arrive late and they won’t require it",Miche
40,Great Entertainment,"Variety of music, comedy and events. Service is good until the show starts, then none. Food leaves a lot to be desired. Usually just get drinks. Pretty strong.",Kim R
30,"not good for vegans, nor those who are not night owls","Our show started at 9 pm which seems to be their standard. This is late for a Sunday night...but we wanted to see the act, so we went. I bought tickets at a table so we would be able to sit down - according to their policy, this meant we had to arrive by 7 and buy at least a $25 dinner. The dinner menu is very limited and only had one vegan entree: a cold quinoa salad, and no vegan dessert. So we arrive by 7, eat our underwhelming yet expensive dinner, and wait for 2 hours for the main show. While we are waiting, I notice they don't seem to enforce the ""must arrive by 7"" policy too strictly. So I guess we didn't need to arrive and wait around for 2 hours. In short, I believe the venue charges too much (with dinner plus tickets) for what they offer.",Tina C
50,Thumbs up!!,I absolutely love this place. We are so happy this venue is in our community. I have taken my 15yo here more times than I can count. It has brought us closer together and has been a great bonding with him musically. We both love the 80's stuff. Thank you Canyon Club. Almost forgot...the staff is awesome!!,Redman367
50,Wilson Phillips at the Canyon Santa Clarita,"Wow ! I wanted to take my granddaughter and her friends to a concert and dinner for her 15th Birthday, and the Canyon is a smaller venue. Wilson Phillips are still amazing ! And the dinner menu does not have a lot of options but everything was delicious and the girls had an awesome time !",vacationcindy2222
30,Noisy and uncomfortable,"We came here for a Herman's Hermits concert (which was WONDERFUL AND FABULOUS!). Rather than paying for general admission, we wanted good seats. So I paid extra to get a table - which also meant that we had to buy a meal. Fine - HH is worth it.Ordering tickets by phone directly from the box office, I was not able to get any written or emailed evidence of my order. So, advice - just go directly to Ticketmaster.Without a printed or emailed ticket, I had nothing to show them and trying to talk to them, when we got there was difficult. They had a band playing so loudly it was impossible to hear or be heard. And they didn't have an outside desk to handle these conversations. But, they sorted it out and we got our assigned seats.According to floor map on Ticketmaster, we were on the main room area, at a table for 4. I am utterly baffled about how they would have gotten 4 people at that table.The good thing - the table was on a raised area, with a long bench seat that ran the entire length of that long row (about 30 feet or more).The bad thing? The table's post was affixed into the ground and there was absolutely no room to sit behind the table - only along either side. (OK, so I am definitely not thin - but the woman at the table next to me was - and she couldn't get behind the table either) Frankly that's a stupid and unkind arrangement. It's impossible to sit next to my husband on one of our rare, actual, dates.The food. He had the crusted prime rib - for about $48.Not impressive. Not special.The mashed potatoes were fine - but too garlicky. (a date, remember?)I had the meat lasagna. It was OK. a bit bland, but not bad - and generous.The asparagus spears that came with it were terrific. Had I known they'd be that good, I would have just ordered that alone, frankly - they were that good.We saw food go by for other people. Some of the servers had no clue how to find hte right tables. (Why? They all have numbers on the seating chart.) This one guy wandered all over the place before he could find his customer.Service was OK. Our server was busy, clearly. She brought us iced tea - never once asked if we wanted sweeteners. Never asked about refills - it took two requests to get her to bring refills.The venue - doesn't feel all that clean - the table was somewhat sticky.It's dark. I guess this is meant to be a night-club.They have a constant stream of bands playing before the main event.Which if you're there for endless shows, is probably good.But they were simply LOUD! We couldn't understand a word of their singing over their amplifiers. That's a pity, because sometimes what they described about their upcoming song sounded like it would be interesting. If only the words had been audible.And then, the main event. If only I could just write a separate review for that.That review would be stupendous!You COULD hear Peter Noone and his guys.He completely engaged the audience, which was utterly enthusiastic.There were children in the audience, pre-teen girls - and Noone and his bassist jumped down to dance with them - charming the entire audience.Back to the venue.This was really a surprise. We had been to a previous Saban venue at a theater in Beverly Hills to see Gordon Lightfoot. It was a very different experience. That was a converted movie theater. The acoustics were awful - no speakers in the balcony area - and we could barely hear the singer at all. Which was why I bought the closer seats.Wow what a difference. This is a proper nightclub - and if you like lots and lots of noise - this is it.This is located in a mall and there is plenty of parking.If there were someone else playing here that I wanted to see - I would skip the food.And the place is small enough that you can see the stage, or see the performers on monitors all over the room.",taxwriter
50,Concert venue,An hour of this side of LA from the Bay Area about 5 hours roughly driving time cool 600 person concert venue with food cocktails merch for a very reasonable price in the last couple months I've seen Yngwie Malmsteen Boingo Boingo and The Smithereens all sitting at a table about ten feet away from the stage excellent Concert Experience I know I've been going to concerts for 40-something years excellent bartenders look for Brittany anyway we stay usually at the Hampton Inn in Santa Clarita also excellent couple miles away a few good people coming up Shake It Out you'll enjoy,Kenneth K
30,The Canyon is fun but has it's limitations,My wife and I recently attended the Canyon in Santa Clarita to see the Marshall Tucker Band on Saturday March 9th. The location is ideal in the Town Center Mall...which is a fun place to visit for the shopping and other activities around the area. We sat at a two person booth that was uncomfortable...short seat and had a stiff cushion. The good thing is the two person booths face forward toward the stage not like the 4 person booths in front of us that faced at 90 degrees to the stage. We noticed the persons in front of us trying to sit sideways on the booths so that it would be comfortable not straining their necks. We did not have dinner there at 7 pm as recommended by the venue since we heard the food was only fair and expensive...good thing because it would have been a very long time sitting uncomfortably...almost 11pm by the time all 3 acts ended. Unfortunately the music was very loud and sometimes distorted. We had experienced the same bad sound at another Canyon Club location in Agoura many years ago...luckily we brought earplugs. We witnessed others customers covering there ears with there hands. I believe the sound could been acceptable if it were mixed properly from the mixing booth in the center of the room. We opted to eat dinner before the show at the Solita Mexican Restaurant on the upper level of the Town Center Mall just a short walk from The Canyon which was excellent. We did order a $36 bottle of Cabernet wine which was decent at around 8:00 pm to help satisfy our $25 dollar per person recommended expenditure. The service was fast and efficient and noticed all the table checks were picked up at around 8:30 pm before the main act came on at 9 pm...we left a $10 tip for the server. The restrooms are located outside and across from the front entrance to the Canyon that's why they put on a wristband when you enter the premises the first time with your ticket. After the show we were directed outside since the Mall had closed and walked throughout the parking lot to return to our Hotel at the Hyatt Regency about a 10 minute walk to the opposite end of the Mall. We stopped at the Cheesecake Factory (excellent food) and had dessert which is right outside the Mall. Both my wife and I are seniors so better sound and comfort would have made the evening much more enjoyable but nevertheless it was still a fun !,stevemiller007
50,"Wonderful venue, great concerts!","we've been to see the following concerts: The Wailers (Bob Marley's son), REO Speedwagon, and Berlin. We will be going to see Gordon Lightfoot next month. It's worth it to buy the premium front row seats! Thank you, the Canyon, for bringing top notch entertainment to the Santa Clarita Valley!!",Meli H
40,Concerts now in our local Community!!!,"The original Canyon Club, which is also the Saban in Beverly Hills, and The Rose inPasadena have now opened in Valencia, CA and we are oh so glad!If you enjoy seeing your FAV bands in an intimate Venue-THIS is the place!I have been to all 4 of their Venue's and with the exception of Saban, they are all similar as far as seating and dinner.I have seen Justin Hayward of The Moody Blues here as well as another 60's Rocker and I have been highly satisfied with my seats (up close and personal)!!The food is a bit pricey, and quality is fair, but the Venue and intimacy of seeing yourfavorite bands are more than worth it!",Tari K
10,Worst dining/concert experience!,Brought my hubby here for concert. To get a table to sit u have to buy dinner and spend at least $25 per person. So thought would b fun date night right?? Well it took almost 1/2 hour to get drinks. Then I needed to know what were the ingredients in the meal and the waitress had to be asked 3 times and took another 15 minutes to get a response. Then another waitress had no clue about my dietary issues and said I should just order a salad! I ended up having a wedge salad that was $13.50 and as you can see was tiny and the outside piece was bad! Oh and a baked potato... hubby had the sirloin lasagna that he said tasted like it was a frozen lasagna and just microwaved. I’m sorry but I won’t come back!,Paula R
30,Sunday Gospel Brunch,"Went for a church fundraiser. Musical group, band, and choir were excellent. The food was just ok. It probably would have been better if it was hotter (with heat). Food service was very unorganized. The staff was very courteous and seemed to be trying hard but they were very inexperienced. There's lots of free parking.",ibaol
40,Great music venue!,"Went to see a Mana tribute band here with hubby and friends and was very happy with the experience. We skipped the dinner seating and opted for the small tables at the back of the venue for drinks and appetizers. The food was average and the mixed drinks strong but what really made the night great was how awesome the band was. They played for an hour and a half straight and from what I could see there really was not a bad seat in the house. On really popular songs, we made our way to the dance floor and literally were right in front of the stage. Our $25 ticket was totally worth it. A tip for the venue is to buy tickets direct from their box office as that will save you about $20 (per ticket) in Ticketmaster fees. Also parking is free and plentiful as this venue sits inside the mall. We’ll definitely be back.",Caroline L
40,"Good Music Venue, Horrible Food","We went to see Marc Cohn, the show itself was incredible. Excellent sound and we were able to see everything. Too many people talking during the concert. We were required to spend $25 there and since it was our first time here, we decided to get dinner as well. It was horrible. I had salmon which was from frozen, not fresh, it was the worst salmon I have ever had. My friend got the chicken, which was probably made 4 hours earlier and just re-heated. Definitely, save your money on dinner, order drinks and maybe an appetizer.",Lori M
40,Great music venue in scv,"If you want a seat, you’ll need to buy dinner, a $25 minimum per person. You’ll spend that anywhere for dinner. The rib eye was very good. I’ve been there three times. I would advise not getting the outer tables. When you buy tickets it appears that these tables are touching the stage. They don’t. The problem is that they are in front of the bar and many who do not get the dinner seating and squeeze into that area blocking you view. People just don’t care. After paying a higher price to be seated and buying dinner, you don’t want your view blocked by these deadbeats that just squeeze into that area to view the entire show, that’s just wrong. They should rope off that corner of the large bar to keep their higher paying customers happy. If I can’t get seats closer to the center , I will NOT go. The bouncer staff is great, they kept moving the deadbeats back , but as soon as they walked away, they would just squeeze back in.",wvillamil
40,Good local venue to see a show,"We've seen two shows at the club. In both cases, the artists gave great performances as the small club size allows for an intimate performance with the ability to connect with the audience. The club has reserved table seating--that requires a $25 pp minimum food/beverage purchase--or SRO. We chose the table seating for both events, and were totally underwhelmed by the selection and quality of the food. Our expectations were low but were unmet. The wait staff was great in one case, bad in the other, where she said: ""We add a 20% service, but I wanted you to be aware that I get only 8%, since it's shared with a lot of others."" (Of course, she didn't see her after taking our order until it was time to deliver the bill.) Back to the music... It's great to be able to get up close to performers, and that makes the rest tolerable. We saw the Spinners and Stone Temple Pilots. Two very different crowds, both great shows.",Fred E
