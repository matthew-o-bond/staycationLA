30,Just o k,went for a facial. Esthetician was late getting started and finished early. I did not get what I paid for..pressure to buy their products,Lulu120639
30,Front Desk Staff is awful!,"I've had several massages over the months at this La Verne location but each time I am turned off by the front desk staff! I've walked in and stood at the desk, waiting to be greeted, while staff chats amongst themselves or texts on their phones! I've asked for a female staff person and been given a male. I've shown up for an appt, only to be told that my appt had been cancelled. ( I didn't cancel it) I much prefer the Claremont Massage Envy...great staff!!!",dzrodgers
40,Relaxing,I enjoy the massages and the facials are great. Very relaxing. I go every few months. Would go more often but can't afford it!,daytrippergal
