40,"No Rude People, Bad Seats","Largo is a nice small venue. There were no rude or grumpy staff members that I came in contact with. Parking is $10.00 right next store in a garage. For an 8:00 show, we were there waiting in line at 5:00, there were three ahead of us. at about 6:00 they gave seat assignments which are based on arrival not on time of purchase. We were told to be back at 7:45 at the latest. We went to eat before the concert. There are not a lot of places to choose from, Norms, Nice Guy(an upscale Italian restaurant), a sushi place, a vegetarian place, Beverly Center has some places, a dim sum place around the corner and Cattle and Claw at Sofitel Hotel .Doors opened at 20 minutes before show.Seats were small, old theater seats, nut much padding under the butt and close together. I can't comment on leg room as I was in the front row and had plenty.:",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imub4ur
50,"Fun, intimate venue for great shows","This is a really great place to see a live show. Every theatre-style seat has a good view of the stage, and you can hear well, too. The auditorium isn't too big, so you feel close to the performers. Looking at their calendar, they feature a lot of great programs.Take a minute to look at the vintage programs on the walls, as well as the interesting art pieces.Check out their policies (on their website) regarding food and phones. If you purchase your tickets online in advance (recommended), you'll go to ""will call"" right at the gate. This starts early so that audience members can get their seat assignments, then grab a bite or a drink nearby and return in time for the show. Once inside, the first thing is the ""Little Room,"" featuring wine and beers. Then there's an open-air ""lobby"" as well as a small stand selling water, sodas, coffee, and cookies. There are large seating diagrams at each door to make it easy to find your spot. A DJ was spinning a great mix as the pre-show.The staff are super friendly and helpful, happy to answer questions to make sure you have a great time.I laughed so much at a performance by ""The Improvised Shakespeare Company"" at Largo, and they'll be performing there again this summer. Their improv is impressive and hilarious - go see them at Largo!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BaggageConveyorBelt
50,A memorial show for Brody Stevens given by his comedian friends,"This was a great show given in memory of Brody Stevens. Several comdians gave a funny show that was also a bitter sweet remembrance of their friend. Zak Gilifinakis, Sarah Silverman and others gave a heartfelt comedy routine mixed with anguish and nostalgia. You could tell his death deeply affected them.I have been to several shows at the Coronet and find it a great place to watch comedy. There is not a bad seat in the house. Will call tickets are first come first served, cash only. We got there early and scored some good seats. The seats are not the most comfortable, but, the view of the stage and sound is good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mazuza2
50,Fantastic venue to sit back and enjoy the show!,"We had a great experience at Largo. We had bought tickets online - show sold out quickly. We arrived to the small venue at 545pm and got in line for seat assignment which started at 6pm. We got 4th row centre! Seat assignments are noted on a tiny piece of paper! We then went for dinner and returned around 745pm to have a drink before the show. There is a small bar there which gets pretty busy. The show started at 830pm and was awesome. There is no bad seat in the house. Although I usually like to take a few pictures during a concert, I actually enjoyed their no cell phone / camera policy. Just sit back and enjoy the show!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellewug
40,Interesting Venue,"Built in 1947, the Coronet Theater once hosted screenings of avant-garde films by Kenneth Anger, Stan Brakhage, and more. It's now home of The Largo, a beloved music and comedy club that in 2008 vacated the Fairfax District for this 280 seat theater. In addition to the theater, the Largo complex includes The Little Room to fulfill your adult beverage needs and a coffee bar with merch from the performers for sale. All rooms exit into an open courtyard with ""Watch for Falling Fruit"" signs strategically posted. Should you go, and you should, take time to understand their somewhat unorthodox seating policy. We recently saw Tig Notaro perform ""With Friends"" and enjoyed the entire show. As for the seat cushions, I think they're the originals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paul_Har
50,Just a great venue,"Sold-out showed started at 8:30 PM. We send 2 of our party of 8 to wait in line at about 5:15 PM, with the remaining 6 arriving about 5:45. We with in the first dozen. At 6 PM they began handing out tickets to the line, so a few minutes after 6 we were given seat assignments, and told to be back by 8:15 PM. We went to a Odon place just down the street, had a full, relaxing meal, and returned by 8 PM. The venue is amazing; no bad seats. We got fantastic seats.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Doc220
40,Cool Place for Show,"Was here for a taping of Doug Loves Movies. There is parking right next door in a garage. I think it was $10 for the night. Not sure how other shows work but for DLM we had to get here early to get a good seat assigned to us then we could leave and come back right before the show started. Might sound like a pain but it was good to be able to leave and grab dinner or whatever instead of just standing in line the whole time until showtime. They have an area outside the theater for drinks. Inside the theater no drinks allowed. The show was great, seating is a little tight. Nice old school theater. Fun time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jointfilms
40,Cool Local Concert Hall,"Great for up-close seating at a reasonable price. This intimately sized theater has one ticket price and night-of-the-show seat assignment. It fits a couple of hundred and produces surprisingly good lighting and sound. Be sure to note on their website the time when will-call/ticketing opens (usually 6:00pm for 8:30 show) because seating is assigned from front to back as you pick up your tickets from will-call. If you pick up seats right at 6pm you won’t have a long line, and there are multiple options to have a great dinner walking distance away. The venue also has its own interior courtyard with a bar that is a great place to meet up early before the performance for a drink. We saw Sammy Miller and the Congregation do a jazz/entertainment performance that was really great. We got second row seats and the performers came out afterwards to meet everyone in the courtyard. The venue reminds me of European concerts held in smaller churches with great acoustics, no seat reservations, and a very reasonable price, except here you don’t have to stand in line for 30-40 minutes before the show to get good seats.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PVPTraveler
