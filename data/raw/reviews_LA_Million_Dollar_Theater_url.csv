50,They don’t build building this way anymore!,"They don’t build buildings this way anymore! Any day you can view the theater from the Bradbury Building. Look across the street and view the detailing on the outside of the building. Beautiful, unique, flamboyant are some of the superlatives that can be bantered about.On special occasions, such as the Los Angeles Historic Preservation groups film series the theater is open to the public for exploring, gawking, and even viewing a classic film.The interior is even better than the exterior. Beautiful, classic and shows why over a million dollars, in old dollars, was spent building the theater,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
40,Beautiful Theatre,"Evidently many different types of events are staged here. I attended a Los Angeles Food Bowl function where the panel included feisty Diana Kennedy, a 95 year old expert of Mexican cuisine.

It is located almost next door to Grand Central Market where we went to grab a bite to eat after the presentation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OBD2142
40,Movie Palace from Days Gone By,"I recently saw a screening of Laura presented by Last Remaining Seats from the Los Angeles Conservancy. As usual the screening was fabulous and so entertaining. The theatre was built in 1918 and is not totally restored but the history and decor is do interesting. Yes, there are not enough toilets and there is no air conditioning but that's not what it's about. It's the experience of attending a film noir in a historical theatre with all its charm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsPickle

It's location on Broadway, next to the Grand Central Market was and is a wonderful destination for L.A. History buffs. As part of the L.A. Conservancy, we enjoyed a movie at this historic theater, Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho shown to a full house. The interior of this theater is amazing. The wall and ceiling decorations are beautiful as is the theater's old time ambiance. If you do get to attend a movie showing here, just know that the restrooms have not been updated and the lines can be quite long. Eat prior to going as they have a very limited amount of snacks available. We loved going and hope to return and check out more of the theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZumaDawg
