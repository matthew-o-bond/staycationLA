50,Outstanding,"Right when i entered, it was really clean and organized. The massage technicians were very generous towards me. They give absolute good service, and quite frankly fixed my back problems thanks to Sarah !! I really recommend this place for relaxation. Its just amazing you guys should try it out when you come visit Crowne Plaza !!",Yang649
30,AVOID THE SPA,"Hotel itself was amazing. My issue is with the Spa. Anyone planning to visit the spa should know, it is NOT part of the hotel and it clearly looks like it. The hotel has been beautifully renovated and the spa has not. The description on the website is not even close. It's old, and dirty and not at all the ""serene oasis"" that they claim to be. The manicure was nothing more than a polish change, the facial was just ok but the massage was like nothing I have experienced before. The woman literally climbed onto the table and put her knees in my buttocks while she rubbed my back. This was the extent of the ""deep tissue massage"" that I requested. The rest of it was some sort of odd reflexology that included massaging my belly and throat. Very strange and not at all worth the $200 price tag for a 2 hour massage. Overall a very expensive mistake.",Chefvchicago
50,Escape to relaxation,"This full service spa, tucked near the grand pool terrace with view, offers all you need for a lovely get away. Soft pleasant music, in impeccable surroundings, set the tone for your treatments and pampering by qualified pofessionals who go out of their way to provide every comfort. Extend your relaxation with some time at the pool and enjoy the view.The spa offers wifi access as well. You'll be set to be refreshed and renewed.",Barbara M
