There are sea lions that swim around the pier and you can hear them from almost a mile away:) Worth a visit if you are in the area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sarasutter

Often see Sea Lions, dolphins, occasionally a whale or two.LOTS of parking, lots of walking on a semi circle pier. Shops all along the peir. Alcohol served at some of the restaurants. Two levels of places to stop at. As good of a people watching area as there is. The diversity of the people you see is simply amazing. Large marina attached to the Pier. Bike path goes for 22 miles in the South Bay and it is near thrSouthern end at Redondo. You can surf, play volleyball, just lay out in the sun right next to the pier. You will also see many many fisherman using the pier at all times. Pelicans frequent the area, most of the time. Very safe secure area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Judpma012
50,Clean Public Beach,"This was a good experience for us. Parked for $2, stayed for sunset, walked around and had poke by the pier. People are nice and there were no homeless people around . Police surveys the area quite often, for meters and everything else. You can rent bikes etc. Pier is long and free for going there to fish. We saw a lot who are fishing. Not bad to spend a couple of hours- not to mention a lot of restaurants in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveLiveTravel1976
30,Beautiful beach area,"Love walking the boardwalk and pier. Could have more shops. One thing for out of towners, make sure to feed the meter. We didn't see a sign and everyone else around us had expired time on meters. We came back to find a ticket on our car 15 min before leaving. Told by city police that there is a sign regarding locals having a sticker for free parking.we failed to see the sign and one of the beach goers we asked initially couldn't give us any advice. Next time pay their meter or have a $50 ticket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kcfbfan
40,Lots to Do- Good Value,They have everything here fro an arcade to a 360 degree bar overlooking the water.

The pricing is good al around and you can even fish off the end of the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoCalTig
20,Tired pier which could be so much better,"Redondo Pier is lacking in what it could be, mainly accommodating take out huts and tat shops with a few restaurants / bars mixed in.It really feels underutilised and rather tatty compared to similar piers in adjoining towns which is a real shame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnTravelsAgain

30,Adventurebuddies42 goes to Redondo Beach pier,"We live near the pier. Although we do go a lot we would say it’s average. Older restaurants and shops along the pier, old arcade and games. The parking lot at night has had some issues regarding safety so be careful. There are paddle boats and bikes you can rent to see the sea lions which is fun but be careful the sea lions have a lot of flies and if you get too close they stay with you until you paddle quite a bit away! Various restaurants and activities average cleanliness factor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theadventurebuddies

We have been to Redondo Beach Pier before, but it's been several years ago now.. Still pretty much the same, bars are lit and busy, restaurants are still vibrant. Lots of people just hanging out and having a good time..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JustAretha

20,Disappointed,"We walked the pier around 10 am and there were not many stores or restaurants open. Many of the buildings are old and run down and I don't know that I would eat from some of the smaller shops based on what you see... The farmers market was fun (every Thursday) but other than that, a bit disappointed as we chose a hotel to be close to the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ndmom11
30,"Long sandy beach, complimented by the Pier","Visited both the pier area and the beach at the end of September. Plenty of renovation/redecoration work going on so not sure if this was the reason why a number of shops were closed. Pier has a number of places you can get food and drink but didn’t have time to try any. Had a relaxed walk around the pier and beach so if you have time would recommend you give it a try try. The long sandy beaches is spectacular and the place looks very safe for youngsters. Parking plentiful and relatively low cost for a beach area. On the Thursday we attended there was also a farmers market, and this is worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/465RobertH465
50,Excellent food and Pier,I loved the layout of this pier. It was iconic! Fresh seafood was everywhere. We ate at Crab House - twice! The food was so fresh and loved the service and atmosphere there! The little shops were quaint. Will definitely go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vlee7722
30,No sea lions,"Visited in hopes of seeing sea lions but didn’t see one at all. I will say it’s rough getting around this area with a wheelchair, lots of paths that lead to dead end huge curbs, so would have to turn around and go all the way back the way we came. The views of the ocean were pretty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dalezava
30,Hmmm Looking Run Down,"We took a walk from from our hotel to the pier, the pier area and shops appearance etc seemed dirty and run down. We were there just after Labor Day and some businesses weren’t open or maybe unoccupied. We did enjoy our meal at Tony’s on the Pier especially the Red Velvet Cake. We continued our walk around the pier and saw people fishing and having a good time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/884barbied
30,Nice beach (smaller so it seems more crowded),"Came here for the first time, on a Sunday of a long weekend. The beach is narrow from the water but we found a decent space to settle in. Kids had a blast paying in the sand. The sand is a little more grainy, compared to Huntington or Santa Monica (the only other 2 beach and piers we’ve been to thus far in Cali). Overall though the beach is good.The pier is nice too. Lots of restaurants and shops to browse around. The restaurants seem to serve about the same food items, but it’s convenient and decent taste. Okay price.What’s really nice is the parking lot is right at the pier and cost is good.Overall good place for spending the whole day bumming around on the beach. 😉",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dinfamily2009

50,I know locals aren't supposed to like it...,"But I love this place! I get it, the restaurants may not be like the ones on Pier Ave up the beach, but this is my favorite pier in California! Its a great place to walk, jog, people watch, take photos, just watch the ocean roll by underneath the pier (how many piers have a place where you can watch waves roll directly toward you and crash onto the beach?). Not sure if that makes sense, but if you walk out on the pier you'll know what I mean. Anyway, I find this place magical and love it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eringJ8997NA

30,Visiting the area? It's worth going...,"This is a nice place to take people from out of town because you can look at the ocean, maybe grab some snacks at some of the seafood shacks, see the live crabs crawling in the tanks... it's cleaner than I remember from years ago when I visited as a child so they're keeping it up well. Lots of fishermen - people-watching overall is great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z1439LCmaryv
20,Interesting Clash of Cultures and Heritage,"When you first walk on the pier you will notice photographs of the early days before 1900. Check out the women's bathing suits which don't exactly resemble those of today. AS you walk out the pier, you will find all kinds of shops from gem stores to souvenirs to suchi, burritoes, gelatos and pizza. You will also find dining spots that have been there for decades such as Nick's Seafood. At the end of the pier are the fishermen, well worth watching. WE were intrigrued by the whole scene.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pfitzgerald1946
50,Great food,Lots of great seafood to try at almost any price range. For a fancy meal in a relaxed environment try Tony’s.

In the summer there is live music too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/snookerddle

Now that's an experience I had at Redondo Beach Pier let alone the magnificent 360 view",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ozzie2Trav

30,Restrictive rules,"Should be great, but the pier and restaurants along the pier look tired and unappealing. Very restrictive rules include no dogs anywhere on the pier or in nearby parks (even on leashes).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/602TomF

There are a ton of food options on the waterfront along funnel cakes, ice cream, desserts, drinks, etc. There is a lot of open space and tons of things for the whole family to do (including an arcade). It’s not a super fancy, high-end pier but I like it that way. Some people on here are asking for a refurb but I disagree, I like it the way it is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elrafacruz
50,Neighborhood Pier,"This pier is not so crowded or busy as Santa Monica or other types of piers.

40,Nice place to get away and enjoy the great ocean view,"Redondo Beach Pier is one of the old piers along the Los Angeles County coastline. It still retains some of the old charm with nice restaurants over the water and some quirky shops on the pier. The large expanse of beach is to the south of the pier and you can have nice time strolling around the pier which has some great vistas of the ocean and the coastline, especially to the south, towards Palos Verdes Peninsula. You can sometimes see shorebirds on the pier and sea lions in the water. It can be a real treat. There is a good size parking lot adjacent to the beach. Visited the pier during winter, so there was not much crowd, but there are plenty of nice places to get a drink or food. Although I did not stay that late, it would be a great place to see the sunset and watch the sun sink into the Pacific Ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech522

50,Great day trip in Redondo Beach!,Was in LA area for a day before heading to Hawaii. Was recommended by a friend to come to Redondo Beach as I had an early flight and didn’t want to hit traffic or be in a place full of crowds.

Parking is only $3/hr and there are a ton of things to see and do on the Pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dia583
40,Pleasant pier,"This is a very pleasant place to spend a couple of hours. There are the usual shops with souvenirs. And there are some nice places to eat. We recommend Tony’s on the pier which has very good seafood. There is plenty of parking and not too expensive. The best time to visit on weekends is probably between 8 and 11 AM before it gets too crowded, specially during the summertime. And after you spend some time at the pier, you can take a short stroll are a much longer walk on the Running parallel to the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vincemc

Don't miss all the little restaurants on the boardwalk. The Slip Bar is very good. And of course there is the famous Naja's with hundreds of different beers available and I think over 70 on tap.There is fishing off the end of the pier too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tpart2
50,Breathtaking!,"I loved everything about this iconic pier. There is plenty to keep people of all ages amused with shops, restaurants and bars while parking was easy and plentiful though we did go in March so it may be a bit more difficult in the height of summer. From the head of the pier on a good day you can view seals and dolphins in all their glory against the backdrop of the fabulous Pacific Ocean. There are plenty of seats to rest on, photo opportunities at every turn. For a great family day out I highly recommend Redondo Beach Pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kencat1966

50,Old and the New,We just loved hanging around on the pier. Just to sit on the International Boardwalk and take in the crashing Pacific waves or to take a snack at one of the many street food kiosks or search for souvenirs or beach and sportswear in the shops. Ambling on to the newer pier to watch the fishermen and the gulls and the occasional pelican and listen to a sealion 'barking'. I could go on. Definitely a place to make memories and to return to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vonnilew
30,Fresh seafood market is unique,"The pier does not have a huge appeal to me because it is a bit on the shabby side. The seafood market downstairs is unique with fish and shell fish that you can pick out and have cooked. Chinese, Mexican, some pubs, some junk food. There is a bit of everything but nothing terribly nice. There is even a new age place that does readings. You can also purchase passage on vessels going out to sea for whale watches and other adventures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mlaustin

50,Game night,"Do you ever have those days when your in the mood to play Pac Man or skeeball? I sure do which is why I love coming to Redondo Beach Pier Fun Factory arcade. Let's take a step back in time to the 70's and play some retro arcade games. Perfect for a date night, a friend's game night or even family time it's a place that offers retro fun for everyone. How about taking a ride on the Tilt-A-Whirl? On regular days it's $2 but on rainy days it's a discounted price so why not come out and have some fun!? One thing I really love about Redondo Beach Pier is it's ease of parking. Paying at the meeter is very simple and easily managed with the feature to receive text notifications of when time is running out and if you would like to add more time. There is no more need to run back to the meeter just simply reply to the text and add more time without ever leaving your fun.

40,"A calm, relaxing, breezy, scenic stroll along the ocean","Redondo Beach Pier is a laid back place that is just great for a wonderfully scenic stroll alongside the ocean, in addition to dining, shopping and entertainment. Apart from the pier, the beautiful beach stretch offers many outdoor activities including biking, jogging, kayaking, paddle boarding, surfing, swimming, boating, fishing and so on. The Pier also features a panoramic marina.The Pier has a long history dating back to 1889. However, by the time it marked its centennial in 1992, it was already into its seventh version! While the present pier is made of concrete unlike many of its predecessors that were made of wood, it still incorporates design elements that are a throwback to earlier times.Redondo Landing is the gateway building to the Pier – it also showcases some black and white photographs from history captioned “Living the Beach Life”. Among some of the interesting snaps are ones that show the extreme measures ladies had to follow to ensure they did not fall foul of the ‘modesty’ regulations of the 1920s and 1930s!The boardwalk at the Pier also has a bust that commemorates George Freeth who caught the attention of millionaire Henry Huntington. Of Hawaiian and Irish ancestry, Freeth’s specialty was the then novel sport of standup paddle board surfing. He was advertised as the “The Man Who Can Walk on Water”! Freeth is also credited with introducing the sport of water polo and for being the first official life guard on the Pacific coast.Multiple dining choices, casual to fine dining, are available at the Pier. Tony’s on the Pier is amongst the oldest ones. El Torito dates back to the early 1970s. Maison Riz offering French and Japanese cuisine is one of the more recent additions to the Pier. Most of these restaurants offer panoramic ocean views as well.Some worthwhile shopping options include fresh water pearl jewellery as also sea shells shaped into cute collectibles.Realizing that the Pier was getting dated, a plan to revamp the Redondo Beach waterfront was conceptualized to take it back to its glory days. However, that plan has now stalled and the Redondo Beach City Council has withdrawn its bid for the project that was supposed to be a joint development with the California Coastal Commission and a real estate developer.This is possibly because the majority of Redondo Beach residents voted against this development fearing its environmental impact and citing other concerns. With the beachfront revitalization plan having been derailed, the Pier is now back to its glorious past-uncertain future status.One wonders what the future will bring to Redondo Beach and its historic Pier – for the moment though, it remains one of the best places for a calm, relaxing, breezy, scenic stroll along the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMenon

40,Better than it was,They have updated a lot of the pier and its easier to walk around now. Bathrooms are always a little gross and some places are still run down. Fun place to visit. Beautiful views,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J6063CWjamess
40,Not what it was,"This pier keeps losing its luster. It used to be full of unique shops and restaurants but now it's mostly overly expensive eatery's and cheap shops. The pier is neat and you get good views from the horshoe shape but the overall King Harbor experience is slowly declining. The food places are very expensive for average food. There's a few decent bars but you can't take kids there. It's just not what it was 20+ years ago. Each time it gets damaged and they rebuild it, it gets a little worse.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/168brianv
50,Fantastic,"The Pier is awsum. A wrap around so you don’t miss anything. It has everything, bars, cafes, restaurants and stores to cater for everything. Highly recommend a visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tracey30B
50,Awesome,Redondo Beach pier is always an excellent time families from all across the world always find a way to make it to check out this worst Historical location. They have a variety of food courts and shopping locations located throughout the pier if you're visiting don't forget to check out the arcade or if you're into Athletics bring a skateboard or a bike or rollerblades they have a strand that you can bring your bike and ride along with other items pay attention to your surroundings It can get a little hectic sometimes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PercyJackson9
30,Beautiful Sunset & Great Seafood,"Gorgeous sunset over the boats in the water. Make sure to go to Quality Seafood (largest fish market on the west coast) and get oysters on the half shell.The pier itself isn’t that impressive though, pretty touristy. I’d recommend checking out Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach over this area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F1076OPemilyh
50,Nice place to walk around,Quite scenic. Beach shops and food outlets. Good restaurants. Convenient parking. Fishing off the pier is permitted though watch for warnings.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CalgaryWoman
30,Not a Quaint Place But Has Its Own Character.,"Definitely not a quaint place but Redondo Beach Pier area does have its own character. Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach are just beaches and piers, but Redondo Beach Pier area is like a community of shops and eateries, many of them are run by Mexican Americans, it is very local. You see people fishing on the pier, on the rocks, on the shore, something you won't see in Hermosa and Manhattan Beach. Most of the eateries there are diners and fast food places, no gourmet food offers. if you are looking for a quaint place to visit, Redondo Beach is not for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2CanadianTravellers

30,Concrete,"If you have never seen a pier before you might enjoy this place, or if you want an evening or afternoons stroll by the sea, this could be a good choice. But compared to Santa Monica there are limited attractions and it is a bit of a concrete monstrosity. The high point is Kincaids, an excellent restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SB01
40,Beautiful view,It’s worthy place to visit if you are close by. Also I definitely recommend to grab a Gelato ice cream and have a seat staring at the sun and fisherman’s.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RenatoCarneiro
50,Fond Memories,"Have been coming to Redondo Beach Pier for years and have nothing but fond memories. Lots of fresh seafood with lots of choices for something else if fresh seafood isn't your thing. Quality Sea Food has lots of live choices as well! Steamers from the east coast are so good. Crab, lobster and clam chowder are also all fresh and delicious. Even have a gaming area for the kids and the churros are off the hook. Used to be super cheap but as the times go, prices have crept up yet still reasonable for the fresh air and seafood selections. Love the live selections, especially the steamer clams and live sweet shrimp.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewyongk

30,Due for a refresh....,"So this is my pier.... I love my pier...but it is dated and due for a renovation. There are some spots that have been around for years. First is Quality seafood...fresh and live cooked on the spot - probably the busiest of all the seafood outlets. Tony's is a favorite - a long time classic...and Barney's Beanery (bar) is a good spot to catch a game, Kincaid's, Samba Brazilian food are some others worth consideration . However most of the eateries here are mom and pop fried food stops which have been dilapidated for years. There has been a good amount of bicycle theft so we do not leave our bikes out any longer unfortunately even when locked up.This pier is home to the only sport fishing in the LA bay area. This is where you would leave to go out for half and full day trips.Of all the piers this is the best one to fish from....lot's of space to spread out compared the other local piers.Parking is pretty good too and not too much of a fight...even in busier times of the year.For the last few years proposals have been made and shot down to reinvest and update. It seems developers cannot sync with the people...and vice-versa. It's kind of sad because there are always folks who are afraid of change (aka progress). Change will come...it has too in order to keep this place relevant and operating successfully.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X7833JJjohnr

Beach had seaweed and a lot of screaming kids having fun. Looked like a day camp of some sort for youths. Near the pier so you could get a bite to eat. Very close to a paid underground parking lot which was really convenient.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KkFiff

10,Gross gross gross,Redondo should be ashamed. This is just gross. It is so rundown and smells like old cheap cooking oil and rotten fish. All the restaurants in the middle serve frozen deep fried crap. Took a friend from out of town and we both were appalled. There are two restaurants at the right end that are okay if you go at night so you don't have to see the surrounding area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/izg2014

50,Strolling the Pier,We love to stop and have lunch at Kincaids and then stroll along the pier. Love watching the ocean and all of the people strolling and enjoying a beautiful California day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IndySig
20,Not what it used to be!!!,"In the early 20th century, the Redondo Pier was one of the biggest draws in California. Today, the place needs to be renewed and updated. It has maintained the same basic look for decades and its age shows. Redondo residents need to vote to allow the city to upgrade this well known attraction and make it the jewel it once was again! A historic and nice area that could be improved upon with little effort.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CD1970
50,Good for families,"Great way to see the ocean for people who are too timid to swim or play in the water. Watch fisherman, swimmers and surfers. Good places to eat lunch or dinner here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thai_jim1
50,beach beach beach,so awesome and beautiful there. Lots of shops great parking. easy to walk around they have everything there lots of places to eat or drink. Boat tours galore! went on one boat tour was only 20 dollars each and we had dolphins following our ship. A beautiful and fun sight to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H6151ZNeds
40,A jury on our piers...,"We like the coastal attractions that still have an air of their history -- The Redondo Beach pier has not been scrubbed clean and sanitized into a theme park-like attraction. Modern food places and attractions sidle up against older merchants with classic wares, at many price points for the diverse visitors.Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marlin0
30,Nice view when you are on the pier but that is about it.,"You get a nice view when you walk to the end of the pier, but don't go there to eat or shop as much of the retail and restaurant space attached is empty. There are 2 seafood markets where you can eat and a few bars and small restaurants but some looked dicey. There are a few trinket/t-shirt shops as well if you need a gift that says Redondo Beach but that is about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Momof2Virginia
50,Crowded,Nice place to hang out. There's covered parking. Be patient because you will have to drive around a few minutes to get a spot. The pier is awesome.

40,Nice place,"We spent an hour or so walking around Redondo Beach and the Pier. Caught a few minutes of the sunset. There are plenty of places to eat and shop, and the pier is clean. We didn't eat anywhere, only walked around. For the beach itself, we prefer Santa Monica, but Redondo Beach is a place to check out if in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BaseballFan5
50,An hour or two,"Don’t think this is gonna be someplace that you will be able to spend an entire afternoon. You can go and have a meal, walk around 3 or 4 stores and then hang around the pier. There’s a boardwalk you can walk as well. There’s underground parking for $2 per hour.This is not someplace that you could spend a whole day, but you could probably enjoy an hour or two.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FunintheOCsun
30,Great views of the Ocean - Cheap shops,"The Pier is dated. Shops have your typical novelty items. Nothing upscale for food.

For the kiddos there is Arcade galore in the bottom floor, let’s not forget you can rent fishing poles and buy bait right in the pier!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/579yeseniaf
50,This pier is not your typical pier.,"This pier comes from 2 directions and houses many shops and restaurants. The pier is wide and a great place to watch the sail boats that are nearby. Adjacent to the pier, there is a lower area that houses many places to buy and eat fresh fish as well as an arcade which is fun for young families.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sherry19112016
20,"Touristy, old","I guess if you have never seen the ocean and are into tourist traps, this might be interesting. The beach nearby is good and you are likely to see dolphins (and seals on the buoys), but most of the restaurants are old and tacky, there are far too many shops that are selling touristy junk, and the place is not clean at all. The live seafood market sucks its water that it uses to keep the crabs alive from the very back corner of the area where the boats dock and the water is extremely polluted with gasoline and oil. One of the big attractions is a giant cigarette boat that has rows of seats for what looks like about 100 people. There’s an old indoor amusement park with Tilt-A-Whirls, etc. You get the picture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/661julianq
20,"A pier that is rather tacky, smelly and not at all attractive.","Having already visited Manhattan Beach Pier and Hermosa Beach Pier I was very disappointed with the Redondo Beach Pier...

40,"Stroll the Pier, feast on Yummy food, and enjoy the beauty of nature","First off, I have grown up in Redondo Beach, and I love visiting Northern California and Oregon Beach towns, because they are timeless. I do not subscribe to the theory everything has to be new. I love the cobblestone streets in Italy and Germany. I love the thatched roofs in England. And I love the Redondo Beach pier.Nothing tastes better than a freshly made corn dog and a cup of freshly squeezed lemonade from one of the original Hot Dog stands while you sit at a table near the dipped ice cream store. Seagulls can be seen drifting in the wind. There are kites blowing in the wind from the nearby kite store. The smell of the homemade churros entices you to buy a churro. Splurge and enjoy as they are crisp and so yummy. And, don't forge the homemade potato chips not too far from the dipped ice cream.The pier allows us to remember the simple things in life---the sound of the waves, the cries from the seagulls, the sunlight glistening on the water, the clanging of the buoy, a sailboat drifting by, a flopping fish that has just been caught by a fisherman, and surfers trying to catch a wave. And lets not forget the incredible sunset that can be seen off the end of the pier. Life is Good.Who needs a fancy mall, when you are surrounded by beauty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luv2trvlRedondoBeach
40,Good place to visit but gets busy,"The Redondo Beach pier brings a very diverse group of people. Many places to eat and drink and those gifts everyone likes to buy when they go to a local place like this Beach City.Good thing is they do have a police sub station on the pier so sometimes it might not feel totally safe for a family , but never had a problem. The ocean view is great and you can even fish from this pier at specific points.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsU6111TD

We have made this a regular get away and we’ll continue to be can!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Psi4power
50,Secret get-away pier in southbay,"Of all the piers in the southbay area, I would rate Redondo Beach Pier the best.Parking is easy and relatively cheap. 2 hours for $3.50 or so. And right by the ocean!Pier has lots of restaurants and activities you can sign up, from paddle boat to whale watching etc.Pier has free movies, free concerts etc! And sea birds and pelicans etc are constantly hanging the human while many of them are fishing in a section of the pier.Seals, dolphins, whales are frequently spotted from the pier.And of course, enjoy the sunset.I hesitated to write this as I want to keep Redondo Beach for the locals like it always have been. But when I think about all the beaches and piers north and south of LAX, in terms of food, activities, safety, parking etc, Redondo Beach Pier is the best in my opinion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngyChin
10,Do not go here,"We were looking for r a way to spend time walking and enjoying the fresh air before flying home. Previous trips we have always gone to Santa Monica or Venice beach which are both 5 stars. Redondo is dirty and smelly and a rip off, the arcade is dirty and the whole place is terrible. We left after one hour and headed to Venice. The information I had read advised there were parks and lots to do for young kids and families.

30,Cool but dated,Redondo Pier is cool but seems to lack in capitalizing upon it’s potential. The parking is easy and it is an interesting walk but alot of the structure is in disrepair giving it a seedy appearance. There are cool restaurants and some decent gift shops tucked in here and there. A seal was swimming below barking at fishermen hoping for morsels.

40,Lots to do and see,"Stayed at the hotel across the street for a long weekend. It was nice to be able to walk across the street to visit the pier. There are many good bars, restaurants, and shops to enjoy. There is even an arcade for the whole family. From the pier you can see all kinds of human and wildlife activity. We saw paddle boarders and sightseeing boats. There are a ton of sea lions in the area, and we even saw three dolphins swim right up near the beach to frolic in the shallows. Early March, but the weather was beautiful and the beach & pier were not too crowded. You can rent paddle boats, charter a glass bottom boat to show you the ocean wonders, or rent fishing gear to catch fresh fish from the pier. If you don't want all that work, there are at least two fish markets where you can buy fresh fish, either cooked to order or wrapped to take home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USAPappa

Recently went back over Labor Day weekend at night. So Cal was having a massive heatwave and it was hot and humid, even at the beach where it's normally more mild. There were all kinds of people & kids all over the pier area. A different scene for sure. Some came from as far as Adelanto. Though I prefer a quieter scene without commotion, I gave this a higher rating (for other travelers) because some piers are just that, piers and nothing else.

50,Great for people watching!!,"Pier was a combination for small shops, restaurants and activities. IT was great to just walk through and people watch or stop at one of the little bars for a drink.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lincolnlady64
20,Shabby chiq,"Walked here whilst in the area for work. It’s pleasant enough but unless you just want to sit and people watch there’s not much else here. It’s hardly what I’d describe as ‘beautiful’, it’s just a typical California coastline. Having said that the beach is sandy so would be ok to sunbathe in summer months. The pier is quaint with fisherman catching small stingrays but I thought the cafes on the pier were very overpriced. I wouldn’t recommend making a special visit to Redondo unless you just happened to be staying locally & needed to kill some time! It has the feeling of a ‘dying’ resort.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickS1975
50,Don't miss out,"Piece in the local paper on the passing of Warren Miller, skiing's original film maker, and his impact on city council when the California Beaches were under attack from developers. See what he and a enlightened council, helped save for all of us to enjoy. Walk The Strand and all the piers, just breath it all in, it's unbelievable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaskSilver
50,FAVORITE LA AREA BEACH,"A lot of attention is paid to the Santa Monica and Venice beaches and for very good reasons. Each has a great sandy beach in common yet their own feel. Redondo Beach has a great sandy beach as well as its own feel and should not be missed if visiting the area. All three are equally great for people watching but each is unique. Along the Redondo Beach pier are numerous restaurants, places for libations, souvenir shops mixed with fresh seafood vendors, fishing boats, some for charters, glass bottom boat tours, locals fishing and ample parking. Take the time to at least check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/982itzas

50,Nice stroll along the beach,"Not over crowded, clean pier, lots of choices for fresh seafood and desserts! We visited Kona Koffee while on the pier and considered a gondola ride around the pier. Many boat excursions available, dock fishing and family friendly activities. If you are looking for a spot with a lot of action, this is not it, however if you are looking to get away from large crowds, I would recommend this pier. There is an arcade called fun fisherman's (not exactly sure if that's the exact name), that would be best for kids, massive arcade with games and food, etc.!

50,Fun and relaxing,"Pier has a good mixture of shops and eateries. My children enjoy the gelato ice cream and playing on the beach. Great place to walk or jog on the strand. Early morning is not too crowded. You can park in parking structure or side streets have meters. I think 25 cents gets you 10 minutes only. Also people Fish off the pier, but I would be cautious of eating any of those catches! We like Kincaids but it is pricey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kkohara
50,Iconic trip,"Redondo Pier is not for everybody.. It is very old school and very diverse in cultures. It is a true fishermans pier with great food stops, not very expensive, but good variety. Quality Seafood downstairs has every kind of fresh fish imaginable, cooked or steamed, right in front if you. Great people watching place to see so many different cultures visiting in one place..
