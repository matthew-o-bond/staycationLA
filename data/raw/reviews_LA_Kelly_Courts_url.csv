50,Kelly Courts - A Great Place to Play Pickleball,"I was traveling with my wife to a meeting in L.A. and found a great place to play Pickleball. The Kelly Courts in Hermosa Beach has 4 outdoor courts and a super group of players. I felt very welcome to play with some quality Pickleballers. If you are in the Hermosa Beach area looking for a very good place to play, I give this site 5 stars. You do not need to show up before 9:00am as they have a local noise ordnance were you are not allowed to play until 9:00am",ctaylor882017
