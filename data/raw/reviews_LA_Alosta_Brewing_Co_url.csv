50,Micro brews and a great crowd. Hard to beat that.,"With hundreds of microbrews popping up all over California, It‚Äôs nice to have one that comes with a friendly atmosphere and fair prices. The Outdoor beer garden is always nice. All there beers and spirits are made in house. They have a tasting room for those who want to try new and exciting brews.Also every week they host different functions, Like food truck cook offs, trivia nights and bingo.But the king of all there events is the annual Pint wood derby race where they host multiple other brewery's and individuals in two classes to race on there custom built track. JMS racing engines a local machine shop brings a killer car every year winning the last 3 of 4. The brew cup has been won by different breweries each year. It really is a great time for all ages bring your families for this one.You really cant have a bad time at a place like this. So come by and just say hi. Or be like me and have a spadra. Or three. üëçüèº Amazing beer",jeffjZc
50,Good Beers,"In an industrial park, a little off the beaten path, but well worth the visit.Started with a taster flight in-order to hone in on a beer that I wanted a pint of, of the four I tasted, I would have had a pint of each! Very good beer, cool spot and friendly staff - recommend it for someone looking to get a nice pint of craft beer when staying in the area.",Michael H
40,Good beer,"Stopped in around six, nice little place. Can sit in brewery or what I will call lounge. No good, but it is BYOF. Good beers. Flight charged by the 5oz pour, so will vary based in what you get. Very happy with my IPA and stout/porter selection.",M P
30,"Good Beer, But SERIOUSLY NEEDS AC!","We've been here several times for a nice brew. In the past we must have visited during winter. Well this time we dropped by over the Labor weekend and found that the place doesn't have any real air conditioning. They have a small room off to the side with under performing AC. Unfortunately, everyone wanted in there so all those warm bodies effectively negated any real cooling by the weak air conditioning system. I felt bad for the poor employees who looked really hot and misreable. So, we chugged our beers and left as soon as we could. To sum it up, I give the beer a 4 out 5 review and the facility comfort a 2 out 5 for an overal score of 3. I like their Lager the best, while their Blonde is just ok. To the Alosta owners, I'm not trying to be harsh, but please correct the AC situation. Thanks!",GlenDimas
40,Alosta Brewing,"Like beer? In the Covina, California area? Stop at Alosta Brewing Company for some really good craft beer. I 'm an IPA nut, so I really liked the Second Empire DIPA.",Bob P

40,THE BREWS ALRIGHT,"Alosta is a nice enough place to get your beer on, but do not buy a hot dog from the wiener cart called Serendoggity here, over priced and terrible. Other than that I highly recommend Alsota, great beer selection.",Shana S
