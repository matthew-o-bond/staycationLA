40,Great place to country dance or just watch,"The great, large dance floor attracts some good dancers, but they also have lessons at 7PM for new dancers , or you can just watch. There is a stage next to the dance floor (no live music) that you can line dance or do West Coast swing while they do two step or line dances on the main floor. It attracts an older crowd and experienced dancers earlier in the evening, later on a younger crowd comes in. A place to have fun with your friends.The club is only open Friday and Saturday nights starting at 6PM. After 10 PM or so, the DJ plays more line dances and free dancing, so non- country dancers can join in.",Wanderer764993
40,Fun,"Always a fun time. Every time I go I see a plethora of friends, that I hadn't expected to see. The bartenders are nice and fun. They handle drunkards in a ""low key"" manner, so they don't make a scene trying to get out a drunk person.",williamsmia29
40,Best cowboy bar I've found in LA/OC,"I travel to Orange County for work a few times a year and when I go I like to check out the dance places. I'm a little partial to country bars since most of my bar roaming background is from Colorado and Texas. I took my girlfriend with me this time and we decide to check a few out and rate them. We googled and came up with a list of places to visit. Something a bit different in thier style in this area is they call out a dance and everyone does that dance, rather then you decide what you want to do to the music yourself. Here are our ratings in 1-10 in order of how we liked them:9 - Montana's in San Dimas. Not much else you could ask for in a ""cowboy"" bar. Good band and a big dance floor. Lots of friendly people. The decor was interesting. A top notch ""cowboy bar"" in the big city!8- Cowboy Country in Longbeach. Another great place. People were very friendly here. This place has just enough of the ""dive"" feel to it. They have two medium size dance floors. One is the main one where they call out a dance and everyone does it. The other is do what ever you want. The bands here were great! They have a great selection of apparel if you're looking for a T shirt or other wearable sovenir.7- InCahoots in Fullerton. Another nice size dance floor. Was here on a Tuesday night, but there was a large crowd here. A nice place. I'd like to go back on a weekend and check it out.3 - The Ranch Saloon in Anaheim. This place was by far the nicest place of them all. It's in what looks like a office building. You would'nt think there is a cowboy bar there. ""The Ranch"" steak restaurant next door is reported to have very good food. The bar area is decorated like a outdoor log cabin kind of strurcture. Very nice. Great light show and kind of a stadium type seating arangment. The floor is a nice large floor, but not large enough to hold all of the dancers. Why is my rating so low? I've never experienced this before in my 30 years of dancing, but they seem to have a ""Dance Police"" that kicks you off the floor if you're not doing the dance you are supose to be doing. Yes, they came up to my girlfriend and told us we either needed to do the 10 step or get off of the floor! We were in the middle of the floor swing dancing with everyone else dancing around the perimeter of the floor. We weren't in anyone's way. They do call ""freestyle"" and that means you can dance however you want. This ""Dance Police"" gave me several other ""citations"" that night for things like standing in the aisle area, standing on the edge of the dance floor and not moving immediatly on the dance floor when the music started. Too bad because it's such a nice place. After talking to people at some of the other places, we found out that this place has a reputation for this.",BLCDAD
40,I always have a good time there but it has some negatives.,"I visit Montanas once a year when I'm in the area. I like the girls that work the window when you pay your cover charge of $5 or $10. The bouncers / greeters / moody fellas that have been there possibly too long kinda rub me the wrong way sometimes. Of course they have their ""favorites"" or ""regulars"" that they hug and sometimes hang all over (consensually), that's to be expected. The dark haired guy that is at the entrance is often cocky and rude but I feel I have the ability to get around it. If I was sensitive to his attitude he might make me cry.Don't go there hungry because you will be disappointed. When I was there on the 1st of November I arrived after 10pm and I saw 3 different companies deliver pizza within the first hour that I was there. The worst part of a bar not having food is that people get too drunk too easy and nothing good can come from that!Angie is a great bartender and very consistent. The best thing about Montanas is the people that visit there. I haven't ever felt alone while there by myself. I will continue to go but I don't think I'd drive an hour just to go there. Like I mentioned, I go because I'm already in the area and I like to dance.",Karen S
