50,Admirable balancing act,"Unveiled in January 2019 this latest sculpture by the American artist Tom Friedman is marvellous. In stainless steel, it is symbolic of rushing about and deadlines that many of us experience these days.Precariously keeping many takeaway cartons in equilibrium, the figure hastens to complete the many deliveries on his head.I think it also expresses aspects of the so-called gig economy that is prevalent in many modern societies.",permia
