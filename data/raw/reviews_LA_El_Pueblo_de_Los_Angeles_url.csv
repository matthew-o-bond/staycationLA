50,"Beautiful place, with character","No matter how many times I come to LA , I need to visit El Pueblo de Los Angeles. The place is simply beautiful, nice vendors, and plenty of character in each corner... The place is not big, bit plenty things to see, and eat.. indeed beautiful Mexican food. Don’t miss it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jordi-cr7
50,Wonderful morning in delightful area,"With a gorgeous plaza as centrepiece, there are numerous evocative attractions to see while strolling around the charming area.Amongst these is the Old Plaza Fire House Museum that gives an engaging account of the time when most buildings were wooden and fires were common.An imposing statue of King Carlos III who was King of Spain and thus of these lands from 1759 to 1788 is prominent in the Plaza.Immigrants being at the heart of city and country, the Italian American and Chinese American Museums detail well the hardships faced by newcomers as well as the opportunities. The latter is in the impressive Garnier Building.Olvera Street is charming. Colourful with a fine array of stalls with much on offer. Included in the choice of eateries is Cielito Lindo Restaurant where we alighted for a delicious Mexican lunch.Being the first church in the city, Our Lady Queen of Angels Church was tranquil and well worth visiting.Other museums that evoke former times are Adobe Avila and the Old Winery. Former dominion by Spain and Mexico is reflected by the beautiful Instituto Cultural Mexicano which has grand murals and ornamentation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
50,Very pretty area,"This is a rather nice area that gives you the idea that you’ve entered Mexico. There are stores that specialize in Mexican clothes and goods and numerous kiosks selling Mexican goods. There are also a couple of Mexican restaurants, the one we ate at, was created in 1930 (which is quite old for a CA restaurant). The area itself is pretty with some large and interesting trees. There is also a small church worth visiting and a number of historical buildings that were closed when we visited. Not sure where the best place to park is located. We parked in the metro area across the street which cost $2 every 15 minutes. I would think there would be a better choice for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinaNtravel
40,Mixed Fajitas & Meatball Soup on Olvera Street (Placita Olvera),"Good, healthy, light mixed fajitas and meatball soup. Everything was really good there including the service. However, the parking fee ($17.50) was unexpected and exorbitant!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caleur25
50,awesome,"Very interesting place, awesome to see were Los Angeles got started enjoyed walking around and getting a feel of old town",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobF1191
50,Historic Local,"This is a small museum but a interesting look into the history of LA. It is located in Olvera Street, where there are many vendors and restaurants that sell traditional Mexican fare.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bkute65
50,Historic part of LA,There is lots to see here. The plaza has plaques telling the history--there is also a museum near the Placita church with old artifacts. Inside Olivera Street see the Avila House and the Sisneros mural--all pieces of the story.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cookpias
30,Small square with tourist stalls,All the schoolkids were but I’m not sure what they were looking at. The square has small monuments and there are a few good buildings around. The stalls were all distinctly Mexican stuff.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrdom
40,Historical district of LA.......,El Pueblo is the oldest district of LA built between 1818 and 1926. It's heavily focused on the Mexican culture with a central Old Plaza from where you can visit the Old Plaza Firehouse or the craft market and restaurants in Olvera Street. This street also houses Avila Adobe which is LA's oldest house. It is free to enter to see how the early settlers lived. Well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/92stem
40,Picturesque,"Set some time aside to stroll through this market lane filled with Mexican/Spanish wares and eats. Well laid out with some striking architecture, a fun tourist spot to visit when in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kolletjie
30,La Reina,"I love the history of the Pueblo, dedicated to Our Lady, Queen of the Angels. The sleepy town on the banks of the almost dry river growing into a megalopolis of crooks and con men, and hopefuls arriving by the trainload at the station across the street. There was a whole romantic period of the Californios. During the Civil War era, officers toasted each other to the strains of Kathleen Mauvoreen before departing to combat in the east and some even to a fate at Gettysburg. Yet this stupendously important and poetic history is lost among the kiosks and food vendors and litter. It’s both tragic and ironic. “Forget it Jake. Its Chinatown.”",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikek794
40,Part of recreated old Los Angeles,"Dedicated to the history of the founding of Los Angeles by the Spanish. Lots of history here and you can learn a lot. Plus it's very pretty and can be lively BUT the history of the founding of Los Angeles really didn't take place here. But, it is a cute place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chinapjs
30,Originally settled by Italians!,"Consisting of forty-four acres, this region is a historical re-creation of a typical ""Spanish"" village representing the origins of Los Angeles. Although accurate in spirit, this area of downtown L.A. was originally an Italian enclave, not Mexican. East L.A. is more accurate concerning Hispanic culture in L.A, but not very touristy. I gave this attraction only 3 stars since it's relatively small, overpriced, touristy, and difficult to find parking nearby. Best option is to find street parking a few blocks away in Chinatown, which is also a popular tourist attraction. Best representation of old Spanish/Mexican culture in So. Cal. can be found in San Diego, at Balboa Park and Old Town San Diego.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJCrawford
50,Amazing experience,"A must visit site for anyone who wishes to learn about the early history of L.A. Their daily 45-60min free walking tour is extremely educational. There are a few eateries on site, ranging from eat in restaurants to mom and pop authentic Mexican food stalls. There are 25 historical buildings with some turned into small museums. For example, there is one dedicating to Chinese-American history and another exhibiting a horse drawn “firetruck”. A visit to the oldest adobe in L.A. is also highly recommended",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tolive
40,Great place to visit,"After Grand Central Market we head to El Pueblo de Los Angeles. Great place to visit, very quirky and colourful. Found most of Mexican shop assistant but rude and a bit unhelpful, but it didn’t ruined my visit there . A must in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jordi-cr7
50,Picked the Wrong Day,"A lot of people think of Olvera Street as a tourist trap, but I have visited many times and you get more out of your visit if you wander away from Olvera Street into the rest of the Historic Park.Depending on how you count them, there are about ten museums and historic sites and a dozen statures, markers, and plaques. The Plaza is the historic center of the second largest city in the U.S. and you can learn more taking the tour.We visit often but picked a bad day. Later in the evening there was a large Italian event so parking cost more and the center of the plaza and some buildings were behind a fence. We have visited at Christmas time, twice for LA's birthday party, and other events and the week before canceled because an art festival had the parking lots full.Don't write it off as a tourist trap, it is much more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
40,You won't believe what you will find here,"The first surprise was the Italian-American Museum in El Pueblo. The museum is fairly new but they had great displays about the Italians who came to America and the subsequent generations. Information on wine, prohibition, Italian Catholics, and discrimination against Italians as well as some artwork. Free admission. The second surprise was a neat little restaurant called Chiguacle Sabor Ancestral de Mexico, All three of us had wonderful food. I had the carnitas - melt-in-the-mouth pork. The third surprise was a shopping and dining area with many restaurants selling various Latino/Hispanic food and the shops specializing in leather goods, huaraches, decoratively painted skulls, and woven hand handbags and blankets along with many other items. In the square was a beautiful park with huge fig trees. I found the roots to be particularly fascinating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joan632015
40,Historic birthplace of LA,"El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historical Monument encompasses several blocks located north of the LA Civic Center and right across Alameda Street from Union Station. The Plaza is a nice centerpiece with a central pavilion where cultural events are held quite often. There are trees and places to sit around the central plaza area. There are several historic buildings within El Pueblo, most notably the Pico House and the Plaza Catholic Church which is still an active parish church. The Monument also is home to the Fire Department Museum and the Chinese American Museum which chronicles the accomplishments and struggles of the Chinese American community in Los Angeles. The Monument also includes Olvera Street which has historic and cultural resources as well as shops and restaurants. Very informative and interesting to learn about the origins of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech522

50,So colourful,"Within walking distance of Union Station, a wonderful place to start exploring DownTown LA. Plenty to see, from some of the earliest buildings in LA through to colourful stalls selling all kinds of Spanish-inspired food, souvenirs, clothes, etc along Olvera Street. There are a few written explanations of places of interest like the plaza and bandstand, the water supply and some of the old buildings. You can also visit (free) the well-preserved Avila Adobe on Olvera Street (the oldest standing residence in LA - 1818) for a peek into life for the original settlers, and the beautiful church, Nuestra Señora La Reina de Los Angeles (1822), or watch locals dancing to all kinds of music in the Plaza.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeredithAussie
50,History Fans Welcome!,"If you love the contrast of modern and old, this is a great place to visit. There are a ton of historical buildings, some with small museums, and shops / places to eat. There is a bit of tourism, with all of the vendors, but that doesn't take away from the great hole in the wall eats or the history. Spent an afternoon and can't wait to go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoneExpLauren
40,Great historical lesson of LA,"This was a great area that gives a good historical view of how LA came to be, complete with National Park Service folks, vendors, museums, art installations and historic murals. A bit of a tourist trap, so highly recommend working with local groups on a tour so you get all the ins and outs of important sites in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meganhQ6393OR

40,Hollywood’s version of Old Mexico,"Hollywood’s version of Old Mexico. Often I imagine I am on a Studio back lot when I walk Olvera Street and the surrounding plazas and historic buildings. It just has a false sense of being. Not bad, just not a true representation. Still, it is a fun place to walk, check out the church, Plaza, and visit the quasi historic building. Eat some grinoized Mexican food, perhaps the churros and taquitos at the stand on the upper end of Olvera Street, and have a beer or margarita in one of the cafes. Nothing bad, just a faux representation of Old Mexico.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
30,Nice for an evening stroll,"a friend and I visited this area because it was within walking distance to our hotel. It was cute, lots of old historic buildings and impressive trees. Also plenty of vendors selling cheap gift items. It was a nice place to kill some time in, but it closed up rather early for a Saturday night--around 8 p.m. I enjoyed it, but no need to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cconnches

40,A quick but worthwhile trip,"A nice mix of ""street"" vendors, shops and restaurants. The food is authentic, and the shopping is good if you go into the stores along the sides. Some authentic Mexican wares, which was really nice to see. Worth the stop if you have an hour, although I could have easily spend a half day if I had the time. Went at the end of October close to the día de los muertos or ""day of the dead"". They were just setting up in the square. Would have loved to have had the chance to see it fully set up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlleyKat_8

This center of culture is found at the site of the first settlement of many ethnic groups who contributed to the early history of the area. The central plaza (the town square) draws crowds many times a year who celebrate ""Cinco de Mayo"", ""El Dia de los Muertos"", the"" Blessing of the Animals"", etc. There are many museums to explore: the Chinese American Museum, the Italian American Museum, The Plaza Firehouse, the Pico House, the Sepulveda House, and the Avila Adobe. Close by are other places to visit: Olvera Street, Chinatown, and Little Tokyo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socaltravelers2016
40,A lot of history here,"You could breeze through in 15 minutes, or easily spend hours here depending upon your interest in history, Mexico, its influence on LA, SoCal...Of course, aside from the historical importance of the site, you can also get some great authentic food or Mexican goods. A very busy place - at least on the weekend I was there - yet areas to sit and just watch as well. Right across the street from Union Station so easily accessible from almost all of the city. Strange too is that it is basically across the street from Chinatown, a whole other world altogether.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ydnar
40,Loved It,"Bustling little area, just across from Union Staion, with lots of stalls selling anything from Mexican clothing to toys to snacks to tacky souvenirs. It was early Saturday afternoon when we visited so may have been busier than normal but there was the added attraction of some entertainment going on. There was some traditional Mexican dancing in one area whilst a chap resembling Erik Estrada from CHIPS was belting out some tunes in another whilst the crowd danced away.A great afternoon",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/newspapertaxi

Amazing food and cheap I mean real cheap I don't know how they stay in business cheap.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rubieg2017

If you set apart the high rises around, you could think you're in Mexico in some small village.There's a small square with a classic Spanish style church, and a small plaza packed with souvenir shops and small eateries.

There's a great atmosphere and I love to browse around markets; here they had all kinds of knick knacks and beautiful souvenirs. It's all so colourful, loud and full of life there; go, you'll love it.You can park near there (I saw several car parks) and there are tons of food options.

50,Great Dia de Muertos Festivities and altars.,"Having visited this place many times. I think they do a great job for Day of the Dead festivities and altars. They have face paining that is not too expensive. Good experience for anyone wanting to know a bit more of what this traditional Mexican Holiday is all about. This is usually a week long event with the main days on November 1st seem to get the most packed. Check out the Olvera Street Calendar to see when they will be celebrating this year. Plan ahead, parking is a bit of a hassle but if you go the public transportation route might be the easiest and less of a headache.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gbby0223
40,Historic Los Angeles,"One of the things I love to do whenever we travel is visit the historical and cultural center of a community. For Los Angeles, this is the place to gain a better understanding of its Mexican beginnings. Olvera Street and all the house and shopping on it provides that link to understanding its Mexican past. When I return to our conference most visitors seemed unaware of this historic gem. I loved it and would highly recommend you visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GroverR

50,At The Heart of Old Los Angeles,"It's hard to imagine, seeing LA today, that it began in 1781 when 44 settlers established a farming community. El Pueblo, right across the street from Union Station, is where they set down roots. Fortunately, many of the 19th century buildings have been restored and now house excellent free museums where you CAN imagine LA before freeways. I spent five hours exploring and learning, browsing the stalls selling Mexican wares, and enjoying the happy bustle on a sunny afternoon. At the center is a small park where you can relax in the shade and enjoy live music and dance performances. I found the Avila Adobe, 1884 Plaza Firehouse and the Pico House especially informative and compelling.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chestnuthouse
50,Beautiful Area that shows the early cultures of LA,"El Pueblo de Los Angeles is a very nice open place to visit. It was the first area of settlement in Los Angeles. It represents a lot of the early cultures of Los Angeles, not just the Mexicans (though it is mostly depicting Mexican culture). There is a beautiful plaza in the middle with a entertaining, fun Mexican dance show. Around the plaza, there are a lot of different things to see. There is an old firehouse, the first church in Los Angeles, there is also a Chinese American and a Italian American Museum. This is just what we did, there is even more. Just south if the plaza is Olvera St. which is a semi-traditional feeling Mexican marketplace. There are a couple of attractions on Olvera St. including the Avila Adobe, which is truly a must-see. The Avila Adobe is the oldest still-standing house in Los Angeles, and has been very well restored. The only downside is that it is quite busy, especially Olvera Street; we were there early on a Sunday morning in late January, and it was already quite crowded. All in all, it's a very nice place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YaacovD

It's easy to miss but well worth visiting and it's free.

40,Must see LA history,"This is one of the best attractions of Los Angeles itself (not the suburbs). It is the original settlement of the city back when California was still Mexico. It is a great chance for Old Mexico style shopping and dinning as you walk down the narrow cobblestone street lined with vendors selling leather goods, toys and other ""Made in Mexico"" goods PLUS some really good Mexican restaurants. I usually make my way to the end opposite the plaza for the taquito stand. If you have the time take the tour of the old adobe house and the church. Definitely a festive Old Mexico atmosphere without having to cross the border.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darynb2014
40,Interesting to explore,Quite a bit of historical information about the foundations of the grand city of Los Angeles. This area of the city is historic. There is a central area where there were several operatic singers entertaining the public. There are lots of stalls selling all sorts of clothes and ornaments etc.. A very enjoyable experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cyrilp679
30,Free Tour,"Local people do use this plaza, just chilling. There are also homeless people taking naps there as well. Sometimes, you will see school buses or tourist buses stop by because Olvera Street is one of the tourist attraction spots.There is a Tour Office right near the plaza, right next to the Fire House. They give FREE tour about the historic sites in this neighborhood. It is very informative.Besides shopping and dinning at Olvera Street, there are a few museums near by as well. The Tour Office has all the information.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILoveFoodComa
50,What's not to like?,"This is hands down my favorite part of LA. There are a number of buildings that has the Spanish influence in their architecture including the train station. Imagine the sun shining and all these pretty pastel colored buildings surrounding the nest that is El Pueblo de Los Angeles. Walking through the heart of it, it felt like I've been transported to Mexico. Beautiful historic buildings, brightly colored stalls, musicians playing their guitars and singing and amazing cafes and restaurants. Amazing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaysonc166
50,LA history - it's beginning,"a realy nice preservation of the history of the city. the first house is still standing and you can go through the house for a donation. street vendors for food and couple of blocks of booths with merchandise available. it is worth taking the time to visit this area with museums, shops and church to view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tndawoods

40,la reina,"Our Lady Queen of the Angels. LA was a village camped on the Q On the banks of the LA River, when it had water. Olvera street was the main drag. It was Californio, which is distinct from Mexican. Pico, Figueroa were giants and it's worth seeing. It is tragic that our history has been reduced to curio stalls and mediocre food venues. I like to picture Civil War heroes, Hancock and Armistead, hunkering over their last drink together before they set off to fight for opposite sides. Given the detritus it takes an effort.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikek794
40,Historic area,This area of Los Angeles is historic. The first settlers in this area were Spanish and Mexican and the buildings reflect this. There is a central area where there were several operatic singers entertaining the public. There are lots of stalls selling all sorts of clothes and ornaments etc. and ice cream and snacks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MargaretMaidstone
50,"History of Early Los Angeles, a real gem!",I always come here when I am in town. I went to several museums like the Pico House and the Chinese American Museum that are free and the personnel there were very nice. There was a a lot of Mexican dancing on the plaza. There are a lot of little shops that sell several types of Mexican souvenirs from blankets to jewelry. I usually won't buy much because I can get anything Mexican sold here from the markets of my hometown of Cd. Juarez. But I did buy some simple jewelry from the Catholic church because I support my religion. There were many places to eat but they were very crowded because it was the weekend. You can learn a lot from visiting this historical gem because there is so much history here. I will come again when I return,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/840martae
40,Historic area,Authentic and very Mexican.If you have time (and are interested in history and/or the latin roots of LA) it is a great place to spend a few hours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RW60s
40,Great to explore,"I was at LA Union with 3 hours to kill before heading to Anaheim by rail. Thanks to Trip Advisor I happened upon this historic area and my time was nicely filled.There are a number of exhibitions available for FREE viewing and I have posted a few photographs to show how these early land settlers lived. Well worth spending some time here, I enjoyed it very much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Albywon
40,Mexican part of LA,"My cousin married a Mexicana and they brought me here because they wanted me to taste the most ""Mexican"" spot in LA before I went to Mexico city. They toured me around. They had shops with Our Lady of Guadalupe figurines, Cuahtemoc, dia de los muertos shirts, ponchos, lucha libre masks and all those beautiful and colorful sombreros.I was there the Sunday before México's independence day and you know what that means? There was a fiesta that day. Chicanos waving the Mexican flag, eating tacos, chuletas and drinking Corona in the streets. There was also a small stage assembled at the center of the park that featured traditional Mexican folk dancing. I heard them play Son de la Negra and of course the famous Jarabe Tapatio, the Mexican hat dance.Overall, I enjoyed my experienced at El Pueblo. Just shows you that this part is not just all about Olvera street. This is where the Mexican root of Los Angeles started. After all California used to be part of the United Mexican States.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MattMarquez
40,LA - The Origins,"Very nice place, the mexican district of LA. A Genuine, colored and authentic square near Downtown. A good spot to remember the latin roots of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Valex866
30,Good place for your days off,Was really interesting meet another side of LA. Place that I recommend to explore and stop for lunch and eat a really good Mexican food.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/405v_ctorf
40,Old Mexican area,"We didn't get to see the mural as we got there after 3, that would have been cool, but the house and the whole area was great nonetheless",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Openfj0re
50,A piece of Old Mexico,"I am a native of Los Angeles so I can frequent this place as often as I like (when I am in town), lol. I recommend this place to all who visit Los Angeles. It is like you are back in time in Old Mexico. There are restaurants, all sorts of Mexican food, beverages, and things to purchase. There is an ancient church that dates way back when California was a part of Mexico and L.A. was just a mission place. If you get lucky you will see some cool Mesoamerican Aztec dancers. It is in the downtown area and across the street from Union Station. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cotjos213
50,More than a Street,"Many people know about Olvera Street, a touristy little recreation of a Mexican bizaar, but not everyone knows about he surrounding historic monument. I've been to the monument many times, but this was my longest visit. We had about 5 hours before meeting my wife's brother and his family and my wife wasn't sure what we would do. We didn't have enough time.We arrived shortly after 10 when most everything opens. We began with a quick visit to Plaza Firehouse 1884, the first city owned firehouse in Los Angeles. Next we took a one-hour docent lead tour of the Plaza ending at the south entrance to Olvera Street. The docent was excellent (and I'm a trained docent elsewhere, so I know). She lead us past the historic Pico House and Mason's Lodge, explained about the commemorative statues, and a mural on Mexican independence of about 1812-20.After the tour, we visited the Chinese American Museum because this was once the old China Town. Then across the street to the almost unknown La Plaza de Cultura y Artes, a museum about Mexican culture, history, and arts in Los Angles. Adjacent is the old Plaza Church which began as an assitencia, or sub-mission, to Mission San Gabriel.By this time I needed to do my shopping, 7 leather belts and 4 hats, all at low to reasonable prices. We also visited Avila Adobe, the oldest recognized house in Los Angeles. We finished this just in time to meet my wife's family and enjoyed a wonderful lunch-dinner at La Golondrina, one of my 3 favorite places to eat along Olvera Street. Then more shopping and a churro at Mr. Churro.This was my first visit at Christmas time and the first time I've seen the plaza and street after sunset with all the lights ablaze. This was our second visit this year. We were there for 8 hours and my wife had worried we run out of things to do while waiting for her brother.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
30,Touristy,"This attraction is tacky, touristy and, imho, highly overrated. I have never once taken an out of town visitor here, nor would I. It would be too embarrassing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmichaelVentura
40,Flavours of mexico,"This is situated across the road from Union Station. The free tour was very long at 55 mins and the material boring although the docent was very engaging and friendly. We loved browsing the stores with traditional mexican clothing, souvenirs, decor and other goods. There are numerous restaurants offering authentic fare and all the staff are dressed up in traditional clothing.It has a cosy feel to it and made me want to visit Mexico in future. Chinatown is not far from here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YasminHL
50,This is Mexico north of the border.,"If you were a tourist in Mexico in a small town square you would encounter exactly what you find here. The vendors, the goods, the restaurants the atmosphere all offer a glimpse of Mexico.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/963oliverr
40,Not your typical LA attraction but worth a stop,"Located in downtown LA, this is where the city was founded in 1781 with a mission/church and cemetery. It is worth a stop to learn about the history of LA and you do not have to spend hours. You can see all of the grounds in one hour and there is a parking lot just across the street. You can check the visitor's center, sit on the square, walk around and purchase something from stores/stalls selling crafts and food. Some of the stuff is quite touristy but some of the crafts are just stunning and made by local artists. The whole place has a bit of a Mexican feel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanMD73
30,Not quite what I expected,"This was interesting but much more limited than I expected.It was similar to Cozumel, Mexico with the vendors all selling the same things.The history and buildings were interesting. Restaurants were plentiful.The park that we had hoped to enjoy was closed to the public due to an event that was going on. Admission was being charged and the lines for the event were very long.Not sure I would check this out again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leecabug
50,A taste of Mexico,"This place will give you a taste of Mexico without crossing the border. From people singing Mexican music, to the plaza, food, and vendors, I couldn't ask for more. Great little culture experience for those seeking one or those looking for memories of Mexico.You will see homeless on the outskirts of the plaza but where will you not see them anywhere you go. Food was rather expensive in my opinion and would have like to see taco trucks. Overall it was a nice site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Goodtimes1104
50,Olvera Street,"My earliest memory of Olvera Street was when I was five years old. My day camp took us here for a field trip. I loved it then and I have always loved this place. I love the little shops with the unique craft items. Kids love this place. I like the historical ""first house in Los Angeles"" exhibit. One of my favorite places in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlannalA120
50,Very informative,"I visited the famous El Pueblo de los Angeles, and surrounding touristical places, El Pueblo provides quite a bit of historical information about the foundations of the grand city of Los Angeles, it has many shops stocked with Mexican crraft items such as their candles, now, some of those candles are a work of art, what artristy! The museum representing a hacienda of the past is quite correct in its exhibition, typical home of the time. I as glad to see they have added a movie telling the history of early Califonia.We ate in a restaurant (unforuntely I do not remember the name) but it's right in front of the ""zocalito"" (park with a kiosk), its the first restaurant on the corner, excellent food, hand made tortllas, um!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/423aliciam
40,Interesting Place,"A good place to learn about the early history of LA, hear some Mexican music, sample the food and just absorb the atmosphere. The first cemetery and house in LA can be viewed here. There is a lovely old local church to visit. Great for sitting in the sun and watching people. Next to Union Station which is also a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndrewA962
40,Learn about early LA history and culture and have cheap fun at the same time,"When vacationing, we like to learn about local history and culture and have fun. In Los Angeles, El Pueblo / Olvera Street was a great place to begin. The visitor's center in the restored Sepulveda house gives insight into the early cultural history of Los Angeles, at least the Spanish, Mexican and American influences. We had not realized how ethnically diverse the early ""Spanish"" settlers were! The Siquerios mural ""Tropical America"" is worth seeing for perspective on how we humans can treat each other. Some of the oldest buildings remaining in LA are in the immediate area.Olvera Street is a bit touristy, but is a fun place to shop for souvenirs and satisfy cravings for tamales, churros and other Mexican treats. The nearby Plaza often hosts live music and the large trees (apparently, century-old Moreton Bay figs) provide cool shade on hot days.El Pueblo is near Union Station; we easily accessed it via Metro from Hollywood and avoided having to drive and pay for parking downtown.In short, a nice place to learn something about early Los Angeles history and culture and have inexpensive fun at the same time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/65Rambler
40,Historically interesting if very touristy,"We were attracted to El Pueblo since it was billed as part of LA's (Mexican) origins. And there has definitely been some thoughtful restoration and reconstruction led by a far-sighted lady in the 1930's. It is, however, full of stalls displaying a lot of stuff designed to attract some tourists; and I guess if you want a poncho without the trouble of actually visiting Mexico, this is a place to go. But if you look out for the sign for the public conveniences, between men and omen's (no, I'm not joking!) there's a terrific photographic display of how El Pueblo came about which you shouldn't miss. All in all, a good addition to a downtown LA walking tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MSH-Sussex
40,A memorial to Spainish settlement,"It is good to see this rememberance to the Spainsh settlers. It is often forgotten that the Spainish were in fact the first European settlers to the United States which is no wonder when you travel around and there is nothing left of that period of American history. You go to the East coast and everything is spectactularly preserved or recreated from the time of the Mayflower and onwards but Spainish colonisation seems to be wiped away. So I found this area fascintating, checking out the buildings, walking through Avila house, sifting through the markets you get a feel for what it might have been like in those early days of modern American history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IOGWFH
40,Slice of Mexico,"Came here with a walking tour of downtown LA. What a cute and quaint little street this is! Filled with the color, sights and smells of Mexico, it contains a market of souvenirs, some delicious Mexican restaurants and some museums. The oldest building in LA is established here. Pleasant place to spend an hour or three.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sonsonator
50,Pleasant Surprise,"I didn't really know what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. The Mexican market is of course very touristy, but there's lots to see and do - and everything is for FREE. You can visit some of the oldest houses in LA, completely furnished and with a short yet informative explanation about the owners. There's a church, and the Pico house currently houses a photography exhibition. Also, make sure to visit the Chinese American Museum (Camla, entrance free) next to Pico House for an overview of the life and struggles of Chinese immigrants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PoisonedIvy
50,History and Tradition,"Get to know the roots of L.A, the origins of the city with a very nice and colorful walk nearby downtown L.A",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dominika34
40,Well worth a visit,This was my 4th visit to LA and having 'done' all the glitzy attractions I wanted something a little more cultural. I was staying in Studio City and found it very easy to use the transit system. It was a short walk via Union Station to the area. It is very vibrant and I really enjoyed learning more about the history of LA. It was not particularly busy and it was such a contrast to the usual LA hype. There were places to eat and little museums to wander around. It's well worth a visit. If you're travelling in your car I'm not sure what access or parking is like.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itchyfeet4550
50,Part of My Past,"I will always come here when coming to LA because it makes me proud to learn about the achievements of my Mexican people. Most of the articles sold here come from Mexico, but I do not buy them because I can get them cheaper in my hometown of Juarez. However, I enjoy the museums, the music, and I like to buy a souvenir. Will definitely come here every time I come to LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/840martae
40,A Different LA Attrection,"We enjoyed spending an hour or so wandering around this historic area of old Los Angeles. Sure it's touristy but it still has the flavor of Mexico and the first building ever built in LA, that alone was worth coming for. The vibrant colors of the ceramics and woven fabrics, the musical performances and the aromas of Mexican Food cooking all added to our experience. We were able to witness a few family First Communion Celebrations while we were there.....beautiful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/satellitesue1
50,Get a li'l LA history lesson,"This place is beautiful and offers a serene contrast to the general madness of LA. You're free to explore at your own pace, so you can spend as much or as little time as you'd like -- whether you're planning on breezing through or you intend to take everything in, it's definitely worth a visit. Some other reviewers have said this area is a tourist trap... I can't verify that, but even if that's true, it doesn't change the fact that this is one of the most unique and lovely pieces of architectural history in a city that's full of lovely and unique architecture :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/966JoannaM
40,Vibrant mid-city gem,"El Pueblo bursts with energy. The street vendors, frequent cultural performances, and old-LA spirit make this a unique retreat from the beach culture that dominates most of the sightseeing spots in SoCal. I loved seeing all the luchador masks they have-- there is one for just about every popular character you can think of, which makes for a fun twist on all of the popular superhero movies.There is fantastic Mexican food to be had here, and because of all the performances, it's a different scene every time you visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alyssa_boone

50,A must see in L.A.,"We live in the San Fernando Valley & try to make it to Olvera Street at least 3-4 times a year. We love the atmosphere, the eating at any one of the restaurants where they have out-door seating & enjoying the traveling singers as they serenade tourists. The prices are cometative & reasonable. Take a step back in time to when ""Our Lady, Queen of the Angels"" was still a Mexican city in Alta California!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GabrielA945
30,Over-rated,"Don't eat at any of the tourist restaurants here. Although the street is picturesque, it is also a tourist trap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnitaA539
30,Go if/only you are in LA,"We didn't like Los Angeles at all. People are rude. City is dirty and unimpressive. Attractions (Beverly Hills, Universal Studios, Hollywood Boulevard, and others ) are overrated.I ran into a friend that happened to be in LA as well, just by chance, and he was unimpressed too. His sister recommended visiting El Pueblo as the nicest part of Los Angeles.I agree. It is one of the nicest parts of LA.It is a small area with colonial buildings well preserved.I thought it was funny how they faked briks in the pavement. Fake bricks are all over intersections in downtown Los Angeles, but in other parts at least they have indentations to make them look more real.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ExplorerFromToronto
40,El Pueblo de Los Angeles,"A must see, this is wonderful piece of LA history and cheap shopping and food . The old firehouse, friendly people, great atmosphere, go with a local if you can, they know so much more and can be very informative and passionate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/755petef
30,Nothing special,"If you are in the area it is O.K. to see, otherwise don't bother. Several of the Mexican restaurants are reasonably priced and fun, but you don't have to pay the roving singers. Just politely say no and they will move on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ExperiencedTravelers
40,Worth a visit if in downtown LA,"It is walking distance from downtown LA.When visiting LA, after the Angels Flight, the Wells Fargo museum, Grand Park, I would recommend to going up to the observation deck at the LA City Hall (see my other review) and then, walk to El Pueblo area. You won't be really far from there.The El Pueblo area is not big but it has some beautiful LA founding era buildings, well restored and taken care of. The atmosphere is fun near Olvera street, where you can do some ""mexican souvenirs"" shopping if you wish.As for all the attractions in downtown LA, I would not plan a trip to LA for only one of them... but what makes downtown LA worth a stop is the sum of all those small attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ben0844
20,Much to do about nothing!,"They have tried to brighten this area up since its beginnings, but there is not much to offer. The only plus is the near-by Olvera Street, wonderful Chinese Museum, which few folks know about, and the old archetecture on near-by buildings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EvelynA423
30,A little dissapointing when we were there.,"Perhaps we went by on an ""off"" day. Several street people were very aggressive for handouts / cash. A lot of trash. Just didn't get the good vibe that we did the last time we went by with out of town freinds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kukui_Aloha
50,This is Where it Began,"The second largest city in America began here. The Monument consists of the Plaza, Olvera Street, the Church, the Pico Building, Fire Station Museum, and several other historic buildings and museums. Olvera Street itself is considered the oldest street in Los Angeles and is a narrow shop and restaurant lined sea of activity. The Plaza is the site of festivals, the annual blessing of the animals, and other activities.China town is to the north and Union Station to the east.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
30,Before it all became L.A.!,"Didn't know exactly what the history was for i'm busy enjoying the sites while my tour guide was giving a narrative tour of the history of LA way back until we arrived at this place. The moment I went down the bus I suddenly felt a strange Mexican Vibe. People playing music having the time of their lives. Literally, that is the Mexican culture right in front of my eyes. No wonder there are so many Latinos in LA. I went at the market beside which showcased some wonderful art stuff and souvenir some made from indigenous materials and food with real latin-american authentic taste. It was a real history broken down that day for me to digest. If not for this trip, I absolutely wouldn't have known about Los Angeles History before it became what it is now.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeslieConti
30,Interesting enough,"... but not necessarily worth the hassle to visit. Still, if you're making a day of exploring downtown, a walk around will add to your appreciation of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimP605
40,A Bit of Los Angeles History,"This is the area where the City of Los Angeles originated. There are historical homes built over 100 years ago to recreate what it originally looked like. It's like being in Mexico. Check out the Old Plaza and the Old Plaza church. There are also Mexican restaurants and food carts, handicrafts and such at Olvera street. It is definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JSW842

Great thing is there are restaurants and shops so there's plenty to eat, see and do!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jenacostasp
50,HISTORIC AND FUN DAY OUT,"El Pueblo de Los Angeles is a historic district of Los Angeles, just across the street to Union Station. The buildings were constructed between 1818 and 1926 in the site where a group of Mexican men and women established El Pueblo de Los Angeles in the name of the Spanish Crown in 1781. As the area of Los Angeles expanded and businesses grew, they relocated to other areas and El Pueblo de Los Angeles fell into decline. Christine Sterling (1881-1963), an LA socialite shocked by the condition of LA’s oldest neighborhood launched a campaign in 1926 to save the historic district and with the backing of several prominent citizens who shared her vision, El Pueblo de Los Angeles was saved and restored. Today Olvera Street is a bustling area with many market stalls selling folk art and Mexican sombreros, ponchos, tapestries and many more items. It also offers Mexican food and on weekends you can enjoy musical entertainment which includes singing and dancing in the Old Plaza near the district while you enjoy tasty tacos and tortas. The Old Plaza Church is the oldest church since 1822 with its main altar framed in gold leaf and the oldest surviving house is Avila House built in 1818 by mayor Don Francisco Avila where you can see the restored rooms offering a glimpse of life in the 1840’s. Sepulveda House, built in 1887, originally the home of Eloisa Sepulveda is today El Pueblo’s visitor center. Great place to spend a day or half a day anytime but especially on a weekend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sylvia9933
20,not worth a visit,We thought that we would come in a Hispanic area. It was just one little street with mostly bad restaurants and a little Made in China market! Would not recommend to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mjnvakantiecoach
20,Just OK,"Interesting to see where mexicans founded Los Angeles, you have the history of the founding families there. It has a plaza, like any mexican plaza and a street where you can find mexican food and a mexican market. Not worth if you are a mexican tourist, just if you are home sick or you can not go to Mexico.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/viajeramx1
50,A great spot to shop and eat,El pueblo is a relaxing and fun diversion from the busy city. Perfectly located next to Union Station. It's easy to reach. It's not that big so its perfect for a lazy afternoon or morning. Wonderful gift ideas in the historic buildings that now house shops. A good place to get some tasty tacos and learn about LA's history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/metrochica
50,Get the feel for historic Los Angeles,"I really enjoyed my visit to the historic district. There is a free 45 minute walking tour that is well worth taking. It begins at the office next to the historic station. Visiting this area takes you away from the busyness of today's LA to a more restful time of long ago. The square and the history of the Los Angeles' beginnings are really interesting. The visit to Olvera Street gives the feel of old Mexico. A visit to the oldest adobe house in LA is also really interesting, and shopping at the stalls on the street is a treat. The old church is also a beautiful place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caram30
50,Take the Walking Tour!,"Visited El Pueblo in September. While the area, including Olvera Street is interesting and fun, you really cannot fully appreciate it without taking the walking tour. The tour office is very visible. Fred Robles was our guide and his knowledge of the history of LA is remarkable. You will learn about how Spain sent 11 families to colonize LA. Fred himself is a decendant of one of those families. Its an easy walk and only takes 50 minutes. You will appreciate the area so much more. He will also show you where to get a good margarita in the area. Thank you Fred!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V-World
40,Placita Olvera,"Birthplace of Los Angeles, although the occupyier tries to label Mexicans and their descendents as foreigners this historic place proves quite the opposite. The Chicano, Mexican, Central American and undoubtingly Native American are right at home in this ever growing capital of a new nation AZTLAN! Que Viva Aztlan Libre! Que Viva Los Angeles!For those interested in Art history there is a freshly RESTORED mural painted by the world reknown artist David Alfaro Siqueiros which was COVERED up when he painted it a couple of decades ago.There is always some cultural or political Chicano/Raza event going on and many old buildings which much history around the area. ENJOY!!! LA is a country on its own or just the capital of another newly forming one.Gracias and Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChicanodeAztlan
30,Authentic Aspects,"AKA Olivera Street, there are parts of this street that are very authentic seeming much like markets I've been to in Mexico City and Cuernavaca. There are other parts like a white person selling a hotdog that are not so great. The street is pretty much a bunch of booths selling useless things. But, there is a courtyard atmosphere in the street/alley making it a great place to eat at one of the little Mexican restaurants. Perfect for people watching and having a margarita (little expensive though).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/behest
