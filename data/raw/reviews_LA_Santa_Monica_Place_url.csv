Less expensive parking options are the public lots on 2nd and 4th streets. Be sure to note in writing the actual lot number, floor, and color and an adjacent store because after a long day shopping it is super easy to confuse the lots if you are just visiting.Before you enter your car to exit you will need to pay at the machine, so keep the parking stub with you, they do not have a machine on each floor.... Although if you do forget, you could pay at the exit but only with a credit card.That said, you might incur the wrath of everyone behind you who wants to exit quickly.FYI - City lot has longer free hours of parking than the mall lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeahB627

30,Limited Shopping Experience,"Since I was staying at the DoubleTree down the street, I stopped by Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom before check-in time. I was hoping to see in-person a Fendi handbag I had seen online at Nordstrom.com. Unfortunately, it didn't have it. The only thing I got from Bloomies was frozen yogurt. The selection of clothes seem to be geared toward a younger clientele. When I visit the area I typically have more success at the Century City Mall. I did find a couple of shirts at Uni Qlo, though. I've never shopped there before.One suggestion is in regards to parking. The location sign where you actually park is different from the sign when you exit the parking and enter into the outdoor mall. So, one should note both. Also, the first 90 minutes of parking are free at the mall and other public lots in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/th503
40,"A Good, Well Designed, Shopping Mall","This is a good, centrally located shopping Mall, with a well thought out range of outlets plus a multi screen cinema. There are some excellent restaurants.

40,Good mix of shops and restaurants,"My husband and I enjoyed looking around here. The shopping centre was immaculate and this was unsurprising given the presence of some very high end stores. We didn't visit any of these stores (they all seemed deserted when we were there) and instead opted for the more high street stores that we don't have access to in the UK.

I loved the open air aspect of it - fits very well with the Santa Monica vibe. The Blue Stove restaurant on the top floor of Nordstrom does really high quality tapas, if you are looking for something good quality to eat in the area.

40,Beautiful Outdoor Mall,"The Place is immaculate and very well designed since it was remodeled about a few years ago. The food court has a good selection of Sbarro's, Japanese food, Mexican, and Johnny Rocket's. The only downside is that most of the stores are targeted at customers that are willing to spend a lot. However, it's a nice mall to walk through before or after walking down Third Street Promenade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LASeoulGuy

Tiffany, Kitson, Swarovski, Hugo Boss all have stores here (among many others). It has a couple of levels and includes places to eat. It's open air and has a space on the roof where you can sit and relax in between shopping. It's not very busy around midday so a good time to get the stores to yourself before the sun comes out. There is usually something going on there, FOx's Empire was offering auditions and we bumped into Damon Wayans too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worldwide002

30,Don't let location fool you--guard your belongings!,"Unfortunately, our camera was stolen while we were shopping here. Completely unexpected based not the clientele and caliber of stores. Lesson learned: thieves are everywhere. Watch your stuff",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RBookout

50,Great outdoor mall,"Coming from Phoenix, it was great to enjoy an outdoor mall without dying from heat exhaustion. Great mix of stores, and plenty of parking. Walked from the mall to the beach. But very touristy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aisaac
40,Shopping Mall,"It's a shopping mall, but it was a pleasant place to pass through and buy a few bits as we headed back to find our hotel. Had a decent looking foodcourt (we had already eaten at Joes Pizza's) and an interesting enough variety of shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brentling
40,small shopping mall near beach,some shops and restaurants in there.its good to take some rests. clean and easy to go to 3RD ave,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J359jncd
50,Fantastic outdoor mall!,"Santa Monica Place is a great place to shop. The parkades have ample parking. The mall is walking distance to Santa Monica Pier and beach, and the Third Street Promenade - both great tourist attractions.This mall is anchored by Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom's with many mid- to higher-end shops in between over several levels. The foodcourt on the third level is worth checking out as the outdoor seating is very nice.Check it out as you won't be disappointed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaeljames101
50,"Great shops, great food!","Fantastic place to go shopping, plenty of lovely places upstairs to have a meal as well. Over the few days in LA we ate at a couple of the restaurants upstairs and they were both amazing.If you're at Santa Monica it's definitely worth shopping in here, along with the Third Street Promenade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/8081louise
50,Fantastic Johnny Was Shop in Santa Monica Place,"First day in LA and I had to visit a Johnny Was store as it's been a favourite brand for over a decade and is so expensive in Australia so first stop was Santa Monica Place, the JW shop is big with a lot of stock, staff were so helpful, there was a sale rack too, we bought 3 dresses that we fell in love with and had a lovely time trying on items. We also visited Nordstrom's and Bloomingdales which had a huge range of Free People, as well as the Free People store. We had a lovely time in Santa Monica Place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/acutlc
50,Santa Monica shopping,Santa Monica has the best shopping strip in LA. Large pedestrian area with all the best shops close together. So much of LA requires a car trip between shops but this area is a pleasant stroll.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodiec962
40,Shopping!!!!!,Spent one day shopping in this area and I did like the place! All shops are next to each other or not too far from the other! Got my MK and Ted baker wallets here! Staffs were all very nice and friendly!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wcake12

50,Top notch shopping!,I simply love the outdoor atmosphere of this incredible shopping centre. High end stores means high prices but great selection and fabulous places to eat!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FirstClass001
40,Lovely shopping mall but expensive shops,"My husband and I took Santa Monica Big Blue Bus No. 3 from Los Angeles Bus Depot at Los Angeles International Airport for a day trip to Santa Monica.The bus stopped right in front of the shopping centre. Our first stop was Bloomingdale. Lovely store but really high end, the handbags were around $300 or more. It was Chinese New Year and they had Chinese Stiltwalkers and Chinese music was played. Great photo opportunity! We checked out the food court and it was busy with other shoppers as well.The mall is close to the Santa Monica Pier. Unfortunately, it was a cold rainy day which is most unusual for the area. After a couple of hours of browsing, we left to check out Third Street Promenade shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BornToTravel888
50,Love this place for the unique shopping,"Many upscale brands here and the 3rd level food court with the kids play area is a hit with my 5 year old. The market area is also unique with many local companies selling coffee, cheese, soaps and oils.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Veni-vidi-vicidotcom
40,Thanks - you saved me,"I thought the Santa Monica Pier would be just the thing to treat the nieces, nephews, grandnieces and grandnephews after a visit to the Getty. I was wrong.Instead of lingering at the Pier, we climbed up to Santa Monica Place and found the Food Court on the roof. Everybody was able to get exactly what they wanted from the toddler to the teenager to me.Then we took over several tables overlooking the pier and had a lot more fun than we had down on the pier. I'm sure the shopping is grand, but we spent a couple of hours up there just chilling. It was great!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaneSDallas
40,High end shopping area,"Came here early Dec at late evening with majority of stores closed, my relative told me on weekends it is always packed. Majority are name brand stores but the neighborhood shopping area is quite nice to walk around. Pass by one of the biggest Apple Store I have seen, will come back one day when the stores are open.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndersonYeung
40,Shopping in Santa Monica,"Santa Monica Place hosts lots of shops, most of them actually quite expensive. However, when we were there there was a sale the day after but we bought a jacket for the same price as on the sale, only we had to pick it up the day after. The area around Santa Monica Place is crowded with good shopping. Really worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Birgittaswe
30,Tooo crazy over the holiday period,"Mad traffic both car and foot. Takes hours to get in, out or around the area.I would head elsewhere unless you want to walk along the pier as well and the shopping is just a side dish.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sidji
50,Cool Mall,"Love this place, there's a Hot Topic, a Disney Store, Bloomingdale's and other cool stores. There's also a food corner with different possibilities to choose.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MonikaM94
50,Shopping,This mall is awesome! It's architecture is really modern and beautiful. The shops located in are nice and interesting. The food hall has tones of delicious looking restaurants!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alexclondon95

40,great food!,"We stopped off here for food after the bus journey from downtown, before heading to the beach.There were some nice shops and it was a really modern centre, great to wander around. There was a food court upstairs that had a selection of cheap cuisines to choose from, as well as more fancy restaurants if you want that. We loved that there was a healthy foods counter, something we didn't see much of on our trip to the USA! We had half size portions, I had a wrap and my partner had the Mediterranean salad. Both were huge, great value for money and delicious! Everything was freshly made to order.We then visited the yoghurt shop just further along on the top floor where you could serve yourself lots of different flavours and sorbets too, adding toppings from fresh fruit to chocolate and sauces, so something for everyone! I had coconut and my partner had the watermelon, delicious.We loved it here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mlawrence22
50,Shopping in Style,"We loved the old Santa Monica Place, so we weren't sure what to expect when it was totally rebuilt a couple years ago. This was our first visit to the ""new"" Place, and it was well worth the stop. It has a great variety of stores including the top anchors (Bloomingdales and Nordstroms) and the open-air layout is very nice. You can get a full listing of shops at their website: http://www.santamonicaplace.com/map/. We had a great time at the new mall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cynsha
50,Gorgeous at night!,"Loved it so much I came back twice to go shopping and to check out the views of the beach!I first came in the evening and the was amazed at how long the mall was. The setup is great: the shops are long a closed street with twinkling lights and lots of restaurants with outside patios for your to enjoy the scenery. There are shops that stay open later than others so you can still shop around and walk off the food you just ate. It's not as crowded and hectic like Hollywood blvd., and I didn't mind just sitting down and people watching. I also saw an actor but hated that I could not remember his name! But he was just there shopping like everyone else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeyeA
40,"For non mall people , not bad","I dislike shopping and malls, however this mall is not painful. Very good selection of stores and places to eat. Parking can be tough but spend the cash to valet which makes it a better experience. You can get deals if you know when the sales come up. I got a good looking shirt at Nordstrom's at 50 percent off. Stroll around , be patient and you will have a reasonable good time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrankG379
40,Great way to spend the day,"This is a nice place to spend some time when in Santa Monica. Tidy with a great range of stores for all ages. The Disney store was a big hit! When I was there there was an event in the main concourse with sand sculpture and things to do. It had a great atmosphere and with it being so close to the promenade and the beach, its definitely a place to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daryllg2014
30,Still the same,"There was a massive remodel a few years ago on this mall. I was quite unimpressed and a little put off by the fact that the food court was moved upstairs.I know they say it never rains in California, but it does, and an outdoor food court stinks.It seems as if there are less options in the food court as well.The mall itself is nice. I love some of the stores.But it is nothing any more than most malls.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shanas758
40,Nice mall,"We were told to go to the mall, insteadofthe promenade.mall was beautiful,open air, 3levels,but we enjoyed the promenade much more. The mall was more upscale,and the promenade which is attached but down on the street, was much more fun and shopping was better, try the promenade,unless u like the upscale shops more!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAROLL942
40,Lots of shopping,"Be sure to go on the broad walk street and see the stores, don't miss the Kitson store. the food court is on the top floor just in case you want a bite to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/942vivianap
50,This is how all malls should look,"Wow, this is a beautiful mall, complete with some high-end stores (e.g., Tiffany). New, modern, clean, open-air, multi-level with ample attached parking in an affordable ramp just blocks from the Santa Monica Pier. A fun place to just stroll and browse.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ViajeroJBW
40,Rooftop was a Great Surprise (But Parking is the Real Deal)!,"We discovered the mall accidentally when we turned into the parking garage. This is a great place to park for the Santa Monica Pier, the Promenade or any nearby restaurant not in the mall.After parking and seeing a great photo op of the Santa Monica Pier, I took the stairs up and up, finally to the top (about 5 levels). After a little more walking...viola, this was a surprise! The entire top offered open air areas with a lot of restaurants, smaller snack and drink locations on the roof of the parking garage, and greating seating. Later in the evening when we returned, the cool, contemporary atmosphere had a definite carnival-like fun vibe, with bright neon, very clean, orderly and safe. The area was so large that we wanted to stay. Even after having parked in the gargage earlier in the day, shopping at the Promenade, walking through Will Rogers Park, and the Santa Monica Pier we stayed and explored.We did shop in a few of the larger stores at Santa Monica Place. These stores are typical for shopping anywhere USA. Great shopping, but not like the Promenade. The roof top was the real surprise. The views are great. A very inviting area to find a snack or water before finding your vehicle for the next adventure. This is the most convenient place to park. The view and photographs of the Santa Monica Pier (with the ocean backdrop) are fabulous!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RikiUSA
40,chic mall with nice layout and open air seating at the top floor,"This mall has a nice layout and large open areas which makes the place not look crowded despite being busy. The shops are not unique, and feature more of the high-end brands. The best feature is the open air seating on the top floor, with great views of the promenade and of the beach. You can buy food from the food court and enjoy it alfresco.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cutie888
50,Open Air Mall,Nice selection of upscale stores in an open air mall. Sit down restaurants were expensive. We just wanted quick lunch so we went to food court and ate outside on the roof so nice and sunny.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMRow
40,worth it to eat on the top floor,There is a great view with the open air seating on the top floor of this mall. On the top floor its dedicated mainly to eateries and you can find inexpensive fast food options to restaurant seating. Facing the ocean is free outdoor open seating which offers a nice view of the ocean and there are glass barriers to shield you from any heavy breezes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hoben01
30,Beautiful mall but expensive shopping,"I come to this mall quite frequently due to the fact that I have a friend that works there and I take people that come visit. This mall opened up not to long ago. It opened into an open air mall which is nice but they cater more to the high end shopper who prefer name brand items. We get a lot of people coming from Beverly Hills and surrounding areas. I tend to only go for the food which is pretty good but I generally wouldn't spend to much time here. Walk around the promenade or pier instead, way more interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lifeisapancake
40,Great shopping street and more,"Santa Monica 3rd street. Lots of smaller shops, bars and restaurants all in an attractive pedestrian street. Expensive designer department stores at one end and probably the best looking Apple store in LA in the middle. Street vendors, musicians and more at weekend, Excellent helpers in Blue shirts making finding stuff fun. My tip: Converse shoe shop - brilliant!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grahamrp
30,Limited shopping outlets,Very good shopping experience. Though limited shops especially children stuff. I preferred the promenade,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomm548
50,Good experience,Love this shopping centre - great choice of retailers both large and small as well as brands. Good selection of cafes and bars.Very inviting and nicely designed.Close to Third St promenade too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZoraChris
50,Great outdoor mall!,Loved this mall in Santa Monica! It's so pretty and easy to navigate. Great stores and location. We loved it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/molfetta91
50,A must see when in LA or if you live on the other side of town.,"Wonderful weather, clean air, great restaurants and many different shopping alternatives.Boutique shops and department stores, i.e., Nordstroms. Go up to the top and see views of the ocean coastline and Santa Monica pier.Its a day trip if you plan to do it all.Don't miss the Pier!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Disarma
50,Good for the savvy shopper,"The Santa Monica Place opened in 2010. It replaced a mid-level mall on that same location. Some of the people who live in Santa Monica do not like this mall, because they believe that it's too high end. These are primarily the same people that keep complaining that Santa Monica is not the same sleepy little beach town that it was at one time. Those days are over. It's Silicon Beach now. The community is changing to accommodate the up and coming businesses. We've visited this mall several times and we still patronize it regularly. One of our favorite stores is Love Culture. They have cute and inexpensive clothing. We also love Hot Topic. They have the best t-shirts. If you're a high end shopper, there's a Louis Vuitton, Tiffany, Kate Spade, Bloomingdale's, and Nordstrom. There's also a dining deck on the third level with high end restaurants and a food court. Our favorite place in the food court sells crepes. If you can, make an effort to take your food outside and take a seat with an ocean view. It's the perfect end to a day of shopping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/367debras
50,Beautiful!,"We did far more window shopping than actual shopping, but that was fun as well. Fun place to people watch. Safe, beautiful--walking to and from the promenade. Don't miss the shop--Sea of Silver for really unique jewelry",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BBMT
50,"Fun, upscale mall","It's always nice to have the option to shop in an upscale mall. Mostly window shopping here for us, but that's fine as the Third Street Promenade is just next door. We used this as a way to end our vacation after a couple days at the theme parks. Good times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TraysonH
30,"Great for Tourists, not for locals","Not many local people shopping at this mall. The items are more like gift purchases. You won't find a linen department in the bigger department chain stores. You will find many overpriced smaller items to make your holiday complete.This seems to be working for the owners of the mall, it just makes it impossible for locals with the high cost of parking and the added sales tax they need to go a few miles east or south to get the items they need.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sixxmom
40,A Smidge Difficult To Find (Surprisingly),"We followed mapquest directions and it was a bit difficult. We took a chance and parked the car on 3rd street promenade and asked someone. It was only a 2 block walk in a fun, pedestrian only area. Once we got there, it was really nice. Lots of shops that aren't everywhere. A hint if you're having difficulty, try looking up Nordstrom or Bloomingdale's for driving directions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LyndaLBackToNaples
40,Nice different shops to explore,"Walk all the way down Third Street Promenade and found this place.Nice restaurants on the top floor and wonderful wine shop tucked at the end, near the washrooms.We will come here for lunch the next time we are in town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stefanny28
50,Superb,"Santa Monica placeWhat a fantastic shopping destination. We spent a couple of hours here but could have easily spent a whole day. Nice and neat, clean and again a positive, hip, happening vibe. Management can be proud of an awesome place with a good retail mix.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NathaenM
50,Beautiful!,"You don't normally refer to a shopping mall as beautiful, but this place is different. Yes it has all of the requisites - Bloomingdales and Nordstrom, and dozens of boutiques and specialty shops. But it also has amazing views of the Pacific Ocean and Malibu mountains! It is open-air (perfect in the gorgeous LA coastal environment), has sensational restaurant options and opens into the Third Street Promenade. If you're gonna shop - this is the atmosphere to do it in!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mysticyat
50,Norcino Salumeria at The Market,I was wondering around the market today and strolled past this stand on the top floor. I ordered the brushetta trio. It was fantastic. I am planning to have dinner tonight at their sister restaurant.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zzkk
30,Not so exciting,It's your average mall. It does offer 90 minutes of free parking. There are several shops there from high end luxury stores to regular stores. The food court is on the top floor with nice seating ares.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/832SarahN
50,First time won't be my last.,This was the first time I walked all the way to the end of 3rd Street Promenade and discovered this jewel. The shops and upper food fair with its' unique restaurants made this a future destination for me as well. The Japanese restaurant on the top floor was first rate.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CanadaMelanie
40,"High end shopping, great open spaces","We walked through here on our way back from the beach and ate at the food court which had an international flair to it with food from France, Japan, China, Italy, and the US. We had crepes at the crepemaker which was fun to watch the process through a window. Nice indoor play area for little kids and outside on the top floor you could overlook the ocean. Unique food area up there as well with cooking classes and many local sourced food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Veni-vidi-vicidotcom
30,Another Shopping Mall With A Couple of Good Restaurants,"The shops are expensive, trendy and boring. There a couple of tasty restaurants. I live in the neighborhood and it's convenient to dine out. I would not go out of my way to make a special trip. On the other hand, if you are going to be at the Santa Monica Farmers Market (Wed. & Sat. mornings). this is a nice way to cap off the day, sit down and enjoy a beverage, snack or meal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cuppajoe2
30,Complement to Third Street Promenade,"I like that this small outdoor mall is essentially part of the third street promenade in Santa Monica. In fact, it even shares parking garages with it. That is one of its only saving graces, in addition to that it is so close to the water.The stores (Bloomingdales, Nordstrom) are self-confessedly in their 'Lite' or boutique editions. There are way too many in Santa Monica/South Bay and L.A. as a whole to come here to shop.I'd go here more to dine and window shop than to find some serious shopping alternatives. Make it part of a trip to the third street promenade, and you'll find its a pleasant complement and not much more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/inavigator
10,They call this a mall??,"Very disappointed in this so called mall. The valet from our hotel, the Holiday Inn at the Pier suggested we go to the mall since it was right around the corner from our hotel when I asked for recommendations on finding a place to eat.There was a food court, with different food places, a Japanese place, a pizza one (with bizarre toppings), a taco stand, a winery and a few others. The top floor where the food court is, is an open air area, very boring, nothing that jumps out at you and says, welcome, come on in. None of the employees made you feel like they were glad you were there. There was a few stores on the other floors but it definitely was a waste of time for us. It just seemed unfinished and not very upscale although it looked like they were trying to attract the upper class by the prices they were charging.Just wasn't worth the visit to us...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timsolady
50,Very Large,Full of shops. it is very big and I don't think we managed to get all the way round it. Worth a visit if you like to shop :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KT85
50,A must see shopping destination in LA,Santa Monica has something for everyone. Great shopping and loads of it.The Pier and the beach with magnificient views - don't forget your camera.Lots of restaurants and shops to easily fill in a day or two.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsDJB
50,Shopping in Santa Monica,"This is a great place to go shopping. There were many stores to get just about anything you want. Nordstrom, Sears, Hottopic, etc, etc, as well as many places to eat. There are three levels and lots of things to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WassmannK
50,Excellent Shopping,"This ""outdoor"" shopping centre has Macy's and Nordstrom's at each end! The restaurant in Nordstrom's is fabulous for lunch and the shopping is great throughout the whole 'mall"". Tourists can pick up an information/coupon package and cotton bag from the information booth at the centre of the mall (main floor). You can also walk straight out to the 3rd Street Promenade from Santa Monica Place as well as to the Pier and ocean!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/artyandreaWpg
50,Loved it - neat place to spend an afternoon!,"I loved Santa Monica, and especially loved the shopping district - the closed off Third Avenue with all kinds of activity swirling around you. Eclectic group of shopping - clothing, shoes, name brands and specialty boutiques. You can also hop aboard any of 7-8 ""Big Blue Bus"" public bus to take you around the area for a practically free tour of the greater Santa Monica area. Great food court area above all the action with seating that allows you to look down the avenue and watch all the cool things going on and people-watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JCitytraveler701
50,Great modern centre,Fresh after a major refurbishment this is now a high end shopping centre complete with valet parking. It's full of high end stores with a good mix of smaller quirky stores.There is an excellent range of food options up on the top level.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SWCSydney
40,Good shopping mall (much better than the old one) with a great kids play area,I had been to the old mall several years ago and the new version is much better. The shops used to be a little downmarket and this is now definitely not the case.There is a great childrens play area on the top level (which is free) in the foodcourt. Our kids (age 11 months and 2 year old) loved the play area and we went back a couple of times just for that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelling_owl
40,Better Mall with great atmosphere,"Stopped by because the parking garage was convenient to Third Street Promenade. This mall is really cool looking because you are really outdoors while in the mall. The centre is all open. Stores are typical higher end stores, but some great restaurants on upper level.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dconnau
40,High End shopping,It was nice and clean and lots of pricey places to spend your money!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SueTGGR
40,Great Shopping,We were pleasantly surprised! Bloomies was an amazing store and Nordstrom was decent. They had a great variety of shops and the outdoor shaded mall setting was quite unique. The Market food area looked really good but we did not eat there. This was way more impressive than 3rd Street Promenade.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/preppytraveler09
50,Santa Monica Place is THE Place!,"Santa Monica Place is an incredible mall with an atmosphere of hospitality. When I first visited Santa Monica, on my BIRTHDAY, one of the store employees, Lexi, made me feel welcome and helped explain Santa Monica to me. The Concierge Supervisor Jake Dermirchyan reached out via email and kept me posted of the Christmas events, and it became a place for me to celebrate Christmas. I enjoyed the Kitson store, the upper level food court, a few of the restaurants, the kiosks, the Skechers store, and others. The Christmas programs were great from the tree ceremony to the facebook hunting events. The Mall was much more to me than just a mall, it was a place to unwind and chill with Wifi and good music. Even Mr and Mrs. Claus were at home there!@",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronh781
50,Santa Monica is a hidden treasure!,"Shopped on Third Street Promenade, ate ceviche & chips at Mariasole on the Pier, rode the carousel, ordered lemonade from the original Hot Dog on a Stick shack, and ended the evening at the Sonoma Wine Garden on top of Santa Monica Place! Santa Monica is a wonderful place to spend the day. The new Sonoma Wine Garden, atop Santa Monica Place Mall, has beautiful outdoor seating. Wine can be ordered by 1/2 glass, whole glass or bottle. Can be a romantic getaway with outdoor lanterns, stone decor, overhead lighting, umbrellas and nice throws to wrap up in if needed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OldTowneOrangeCouple
50,Awesome contrast to Pier!,"This was a really welcome place to go following the Pier and beach~nice contrast. The mall is open-air so it's enclosed around the sides but not the top so you don't feel like you're going into an indoor environment. Bloomingdales and Nordstroms are at opposite ends of this small sized mall, with all kinds of stores in between, many upscale. Due to the carmaggeddon- scare and July, sales were all over and really good. Loved the service at all of them especially Kenneth Cole. This was particular to the mall location as the stores on the Promenade had terrible service and were SO loud and crowded. The Market on their 3rd floor (not the Food Court, though it's not bad) has several great choices of good food~we loved Primo and the choc cookie place (unbelievable); and Truefood on the main level opposite end, is unique and very good as well, also.Bathrooms were modern and very clean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Overlandparkers
40,The New Santa Monica Place - Worth Checking Out,"The New Santa Monica Place opened up recently and a friend and I had the chance to visit just last week (September 22, 2010). This indoor/outdoor mall is very modern and functional. The reason I say functional is because there is a lot of seating available on all three levels. It's the kind of place you could meet a friend to catch up on news and then shop and grab a bite to eat. I wish we had a place like this here at home, but the openness of it would not work well with our snowy winters.The dining deck has a view of the beach and places to eat indoors and out. The outside dining area has large heaters to take the chill out of the air on cooler nights. The restrooms were large and clean.We shopped at a few of the stores, but since our goal was to check out the surrounding area, we didn't spend too much time there. If you are shopping in the Santa Monica area, make a stop at Santa Monica Place.They even have their own page on Facebook if you want to know what's going on there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mailgirl
30,Great Location - Kinda Empty!,"Santa Monica Place is a indoor/Outdoor Mall right in the heart of Santa Monica. Its one block from the view of the beach and close to the Pier.
