50,Well done!,"This free, small museum built around a central courtyard and on UCLA's North campus with in-depth collections is well worth visiting. We parked for $6.00/2 hours in Lot 4 that is underground with one side opening almost directly to the brick museum; maps on the wall next to the exits/fee machines are helpful. In Feb. 2020, they had an AIDs photo project, Rina Banerjee's built pieces, Fowler's silver collection (extensive and global), Nigerian art at an early 20th c. world exhibition (""Walled City""), and exquisite pieces from their Pacific collection. All were well done, informative, compelling, and visually stunning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalGypsy_13
50,Absorbing collections,"Walking through the marvellous UCLA campus we were keen to visit this interesting museum. Fortunately it was open at the time.We focussed on the African and Asian works, the likes of which we would not normally have an opportunity to see.Including sculpture, paintings and photographs, it was an absorbing excursion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
50,Very Nice Free Museum,"The Fowler Museum is located on the UCLA Campus, and is a little hard to find. Google Maps was unsuccessful in getting us there. Ask around and you will find it. It is very low-key with changing exhibits. At the moment, the ones we viewed were of step wells in India (which I did not know existed and found both fascinating and beautiful) and Guatemalan Ritual Dance Masks (ditto). Well worth the visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fletch1946

40,Wonderful museum on UCLA campus,"The Fowler Museum is a small art museum located right in the heart of the historic old campus near the four iconic buildings. To be precise, it is located just right next to the iconic Royce Hall and part of it is below the Royce Hall. All the exhibits are temporary but a few of them are long term temporary exhibits. Each exhibit focus on a theme so visitors can focus and study specific topics. The museum is small and nicely done. Take an hour or so from your busy seminar or class to enjoy the great exhibit. No entrant fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrawetJ
50,"Small, free admission, and worth a visit","Westwood has been a frequent business destination in past years, and I am so glad that many years ago I discovered the Fowler Museum on the UCLA campus, with its emphasis on global arts and culture. The exhibits can be quite eclectic: textiles from Timor to an entire exhibit about US State Department-sponsored tours by jazz greats in the 1950s and later. African artist El Anatsui's piece titled Versatility is part of the permanent collection, and is worth looking for if it is on display. Note that museum is only open on specific days for limited hours, so check their website first.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SR260
30,Informative,"I booked a group guided tour for children ages 8-9. The museum exhibit displayed many ornate masks, decorations, and statues. The tour guide was very informative. The hands-on craft was entertaining. The only concern is the long wait in the museum before we headed to the craft room. Kids can get a bit antsy after sitting down on the floor for over 30 minutes. I think perhaps older kids can benefit from this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/preciadogeli
30,Closed Mondays & Tuesdays,"We didn't visit because we checked the hours on the website and discovered that the Fowler is closed on both Monday & Tuesday, the only days we were in town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScottT180
40,Jewel Hidden on UCLA North Campus ...,"The Fowler Museum is hard to find the first time, then it's easy to get back again, just park underground nearby. Easy walking on UCLA campus. Exciting exhibitions, which change frequently, of varied cultures & their artifacts. Large discussion room in lower floor for environmental issues forums. Check it out, it's very special! ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
40,Hidden Treasure,This is a fabulous small museum with ever-changing exhibits. It looks very modern from the outside but inside the impression is that of a contemporary Moroccan house. It is intimate with 4 perfectly sized galleries. Check the website often to see current exhibitions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bruinjeepman
50,A small gem of a musaeum,"The Fowler Ethnographic Museum is located on the Westwood campus of UCLA. The small museum can be reached from an underground parking lot. The museum is free but you have to pay for hourly parking. There is a small, but interesting museum store near the entrance and one large and a number of smaller galleries. The larger gallery holds the museums permanent collection of ethnic and folk art from Africa, Asia, the Pacific and the Americas, both past and present. The smaller galleries have rotating exhibits from the museum and other institutions. The exhibits are dynamically displayed, informative and thought provoking. I have visited the Fowler many times and always enjoy reconnecting with familiar pieces as well as discovering new ones. forms.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I4903UTalang
40,"Well-curated, Small Museum on UCLA Campus","Once you get there, and figure out the parking (you can pay $12 for an all-day pass, which is best if you are going to stay more than four hours), this small museum stages individual exhibitions that are comprehensive and interesting.The one we visited displayed textiles from the American Southwest. Two, in particular, were notable, as was the display technique of creating rounded walls out of rope slats. The curators managed to created space-within-space in a small room. The colors were vibrant and well coordinated, offsetting the informational signs. Well-done!.Wear sturdy walking shoes. This is not little museum on the prairie! Enjoy!Much good food nearby in the student center, second floor, including non-allergenic choices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/977he

50,Excellent cultural art museum; helpful tips below (you won’t get lost),"I have been to the Fowler Museum at UCLA many times and I have found at least one very interesting exhibit each time I have gone. The overall floor area is quite small, with the number of exhibits ranging from four to six. Admission is free. Exhibition durations range from a few months to “ongoing” or “permanent.” The original name of the Fowler included the wording “Cultural History,” and even though the name has been shortened, expect to experience culturally-related artworks which date from the latter-20th century to very recent (one exception, read below). It is very easy to walk the entire museum in an hour or less. Many exhibits are political or environmental in nature; whatever … just something I noticed after many visits.The museum layout is a square. After you enter, pick a direction and keep following it and you’ll end up back where you started. Gallery openings are on each of the four walls; there’s a [lovely] courtyard in the middle. There’s a pretty cool museum shop to the right just after passing the front desk.The permanent exhibit called “Reflecting Culture” has a couple hundred pieces of very old (16th thru 19th centuries) European silver. The quality of the collection is amazing … if you like silver. If not, walk through quickly or skip it altogether. I like the etched plates and the big sailing ship.The ongoing exhibit called “Intersections” features works from UCLA’s permanent collection, and highlights aspects of cultural art from five continents. I have seen this a dozen times and never get bored. Artworks include African and Oceanic masks and reliquary figures, a Mexican “Arbol de la muerte,"" a golden statue of Buddha and various baskets and jewelry from different cultures.Check on-line for changing exhibits, which are featured in the other two rooms and also on the walls between galleries (seriously, the walls frequently feature exhibits of photographic or other flat artwork!). At the time of this writing, “Making Strange” is very trippy, but fun, and “The Art of Hair in Africa” is small, but interesting.SO YOU DON’T GET LOST: Enter Parking Structure #4 from Sunset Boulevard. Go downhill into the structure, pass the kiosk on the left (whether there is someone there or not) and turn LEFT. Continue driving as far as you can get to the far wall. Park, and note your stall number. Get a paid parking ticket from one of the machines in either corner and place the ticket on your dashboard. $3 for one hour; $6 for two hours; $12 for all day. Provided you turned left after the kiosk, the nearest stairs/elevator will get you as close as possible to the Fowler from any parking structure. When you get to campus level walk in the direction that puts the large grass field (Wilson Plaza) on your left and a long staircase to upper campus on your right (you’ll be heading due north). The Fowler is 250 feet away, and there are giant banners on the building. Some of the other reviewers have missed these (see my photos), but the museum should not be hard to find provided you come from Structure #4.Hungry? Ackerman Union is where the most food can be found on campus. From the Fowler, head southbound on the same walkway, in exactly the opposite direction you took from the parking structure. Keep going and you’ll encounter an intersection of several walkways that start to go slightly downhill. The big building on the left, with two flights of wide staircases, is Ackerman Union. Go up the staircases and you’ll find a decent food court after entering on the second floor: Panda Express, Sbarro, Wolfgang Puck, Mexican food, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimL239
40,Great art,"We went to Fowler Museum at UCLA for the first time recently and it was wonderful.They had a very interesting exhibition called, Vivan Sundaram Gagawaka + Postmortem.You can see the pictures at:https://travel4foodnart.wordpress.com/2015/07/11/fowler-museum-at-ucla/",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovetobeinparis
50,A Hidden Gem of Cultural History in LA,"The Fowler Museum is not your typical museum: its focus is on cultural history, with themes as diverse as African textiles; the traditional use of auto parts in east LA to create ""muffler men"" as marketing tools; voodoo in Haiti and other Caribbean countries; and photographic exhibitions, such as the importance of water in Africa, as seen through the lens of Gil Garcetti, a former Los Angeles District Attorney, consultant to TV shows such as The Closer and Major Crimes, and an excellent photographer; and exhibitions of silver jewelry and other objects by master craftsmen in Mexico. There are both permanent and temporary exhibits, as well as family-oriented events, lectures and tours, and live entertainment at exhibition openingsThe exhibits are excellently curated, admission is free at most times, and the Fowler has one of the greatest museum gift shops I've ever seen, full of authentic pieces (jewelry, textiles, decorative items, etc.).The Fowler is located on the UCLA campus, so plan on combining your Fowler visit with a stroll through the famed Royce Hall, the Powell Library, and the Janss Steps, which offers a panoramic view of UCLA's west campus and beyond. There are ample food facilities on campus, so take a break at the Kerckhoff Coffee House or dine at one of the food facilities in Ackerman Union, both of which are located centrally on campus, or stroll down to Westwood Village for a meal and a visit to UCLA's Hammer Museum at Wilshire and Westwood Boulevards.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebeccabQ1168UP
20,The best thing about this museum is...,"... the UCLA campus around it. Fowler is quite small. One room contained a bunch of silver objects; the other had a special exhibit. Two others were closed. Not very interesting to us, anyway. Your taste may differ and you may find yourself staying a little longer than 15 minutes.The location is not obvious, much like every other place on campus if you're not familiar with it. Download a map from ucla.edu. P4 is probably the best choice for parking. It's also very close to the Student Union building (look for the UCLA store) where there are a number of pretty good eateries to choose from. If you can't find what you're looking for, ask a student walking by. Or do as we did: stand there and look confused and some friendly student will stop and ask if s/he can help.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lucky_Eddie
40,Hidden gem on UCLA campus,"We were in the Westwood area and Stephen gave me the tour of UCLA, which so happens to be where he works. After visiting his office, we came across the Fowler Museum. While Stephen has been here many times, it was my first visit, and I was quite impressed with this small museum. They have 2 permanent collections and 2 rotating exhibits. The courtyard, located in the middle of the museum, is quite tranquil.You can view the entire museum in an hour or so. There's even a quaint gift shop, with fair trade items.Admission is free, but they happily accept donations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/callmemochelle
50,Don't Miss,"This is an under-rated museum, we pay a visit every year during our vacation and there are always hidden gems to be found particularly in the visiting exhibitions",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichS67
50,A jewel box on the beautiful ucla campus,A hidden gem. Best kept secret in Los Angeles! Be sure to visit when you are in Westwood. It's free and you can tour all the exhibits in an hour or two. My favorite item is the necklace made of hippopotamus teeth!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ValLosAngeles
50,Culture = art; art = culture. Always something interesting here.,"My favorite thing about the Fowler is the museum’s attention to diversity, which could involve culture, religion or geographic region. The exhibitions usually revolve around religion or tribal life, and are sometimes grouped into themes that encompass a variety of art from different time periods and countries. Occasionally one specific artist with an amazing creativity niche is featured (e.g., Nick Cave's SoundSuits). No matter what, the exhibits are insightful and educational, and sometimes downright fun. I would recommend a visit to anyone.The Fowler is very strong in tribal art, especially Africa, Pacific regions and the Americas. The collection of African tribal art is superb, and UCLA's African Studies Center publishes the definitive art journal on this subject. The building layout is simple: set around a square courtyard. Just begin with one hallway and check out an exhibit. When you return back to the hallway, just turn the corner and go down the next hallway. You should be able to make a complete ""lap"" in a little over an hour.I go on weekends and try to arrive when the museum opens—noon—and I never run into crowds. On occasion there will be a musical performance outside next to the building. If you become a member you get a discount in the museum shop plus invitations to exhibit openings and other events.Notes for your visit . . .(1) Admission is free(2) The most convenient parking is the Pay-By-Space area of Structure 4, via the Sunset Boulevard intersection at Westwood Plaza. $6 for two hours (all day is $12). Take the stairs up to Wilson Plaza and you should be able to see the Fowler sign. Once you’re out in the open, there’s no need to take stairs to higher levels of the campus unless you’re into exploring (some parts are very picturesque).(3) For a quick bite, go to nearby Ackerman Union and take the stairs up to the Terrace Food Court, which has eateries such as Panda Express, Sbarro, Rubio’s, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimL239
50,Go for the Special Exhibits,"Each exhibit is visually stunning, with academic insight and approachable organization. You can see natural materials elevated to fantastic levels through craft, design, art, and culture. I have seen exhibitions of ethnic costumes (most recently,) Taxco silver, textiles of many types, art made from recycled junk, plus many other materials. The Fowler has family events some weekends including activities for kids. Their website has all you need to know.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robinl764
20,Spent far too long trying to find it ....,We were quite disappointed. It and parking were not easy to find.

Not everyone who lands through the gate is a PhD in Geography...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tp21-5649
50,Fowler Museum of Folk Art,"The Fowler Museum is truly a gem. Located on the UCLA campus near Royce Hall, this museum currently is exhibiting Cambodian signboard art from the 1990's. These shop signs are lovely to look at and culturally very important as this was the time that Cambodia first opened up after the repressive Khmer regime. These signs were truly the first sign of a new free-market economy. And they are lovely to boot.All of their exhibitions are well thought out. In the past, I have been able to see Nick Cave's sound suits and other amazing gems.The Fowler also has regular events that include talks and music. Did I mention that there is no admission fee? Parking is pricy, however. We park in Westwood and walk. It is a beautiful campus to walk through.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichellePage
50,Thoroughly enjoyable,"The Fowler on the UCLA campus is a quaint, peaceful museum with extraordinarily interesting exhibits. No crowds, subdued setting and a diverse range of art. Highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judyg714
