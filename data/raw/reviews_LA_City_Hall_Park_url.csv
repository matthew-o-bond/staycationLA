10,Stretch to call this a park,"Stretch to call this a park. Grass near City Hall provides a nice place for a homeless encampment. But it really is not a place to peacefully feed the pigeons or let children freely romp. I imagine we should sit back and dwell on what constitutes a park. This does not fit my criteria of peacefulness or even active recreation. Perhaps the city can claim this space as park land to demonstrate how much park land is available.Still, after deep contemplation this is not a park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
10,Beautiful Little Park occupied by L.A. Homeless,"This is a small park in front of the Los Angeles City Hall...the trees there are beautiful...they are quite old and are extremely large beautiful specimens. There are a few commemorative monuments scatterred through the area. However, the city apparently allows homeless people to squat there. There are quite a few of them . I saw no working people walking thru the area or sitting on the benches...it was like a no man's land except for the homeless sprawled everywhere on the grass.This park is, of course, in downtown Los Angeles...parking is available in various lots and underground garages...but it will be expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rogerdob
