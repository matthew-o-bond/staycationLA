40,Lit park for skateboards and playground equipment,Went here on a 5 hour layover at LAX. Only a 10 minute drive from the terminals and we spent 2 hours here stretching our legs. It was after dusk and the skateboard park was very active with well-behaved kids and the light spilled over onto the childrens' playground equipment. Had a nice time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/440JohnS440
