50,Wonderful whimsical Shakespeare in The woods,"First rate Shakespeare and other productions with energy, zest and in a magical setting. Bring food and eat it under the oaks before the show. Very special place and the people who run it are salt of the earth.",maracujagirl
50,Unique Theater Experience,A solid theater company that always delivers. Thoughtful re-imaginations of classics and more. Expert Shakespearian acting. Superb classes and theater camp as well!,Diana B
50,Hidden gem,"What a delightful experience! Charming outdoor amphitheater, saw a Midsummer Nights Dream which was very enjoyable. The actors are quite talented and certainly energetic! The grounds have picnic tables so itâ€™s nice to bring a picnic and bottle of wine to enjoy before the play. No food is allowed inside the theater. There is a small parking lot, cost is $7. and parking on the street.",31MIK
50,The Ambiance and the Play were amazing!!,"This year for a friend's birthday she wanted her friends to attend a play with her and invited us to a truly magical outdoor theater in Topanga Canyon surrounded by lovely trees, gardens, walking paths and picnic tables. After sharing a light meal and conversation in the gardens we enjoyed the Arthur Miller play ""The Crucible,"" the very disturbing yet well acted tale of hysteria during the Salem witch trials (1692) paralleling McCarthyism (1950s). It is a super COOL place (I actually almost froze to death) of which I had never even heard of prior to your invite. Truly the best part was sharing this fab event with wonderful long time friends whom I adore. Everyone should experience Will Geer's Theatricum Botanicum. Check out their schedule",SusanR
30,Romeo and Juliet,Saw Romeo and Juliet a while ago. Found this decent but not Great! The sun was burning me and since it was outside there was a bee by me during all of the performance which captured my attention.,Michael C
50,A gem in the forest,Love this place! Top notch talent with a little not-so-subtle political agenda (in keeping with its history as an oasis from the Blacklist of the McCarthy era. A fabulous way to enjoy both the wildness and the artistry of Topanga at the same time!,Dorothy C
50,Incredible setting for a Wedding,Attended a wedding ceremony at this location. Incredibly unique and beautiful. It was fantastic to feel like you are in the middle of nature while you watch a couple get married.Lots of seating and shade.,janyamilli
40,Evening theater performance,"A visit to Theatricum Botanicum on a warm summer night is lovely. It's a beautiful outdoors amphitheater with the lighted towering oak trees as the stage's backdrop.Take a sweater. They provide cushions.The play ""Other Desert Cities"" did not hold our interest. The only character whose acting we found to be believable was the recovering alcoholic. We hope to return in the future to see a Shakespearean play....",TangoBabsi
40,Very friendly and fun outdoor venue,Like many outdoor venues the seats are a bit uncomfortable - however the bench seats do have backs and seat cushions are available for rent. There is a small parking lot - which we were grateful to find for $5. Everyone is friendly and welcoming - ample restrooms and snack bar. The acoustics and sight lines are excellent - general seating was not a problem. Production values typical of a neighborhood venue - i.e. mixed bag.,Traveling_a_lot4fun
50,Extraordinary Theatre in an Magical Oak Tree Forest in Topanga Cyn.,"This precious and important theatre was built on the rich historical tapestry of civil liberties. Wonderful repertoire. Each season reflects the roots of fine theater and plays addressing controversial current events. There is also a great theater camp for kids, amazing educational children (and adult) performances with Peter Alsop, improv class and great concert surprises throughout the year such as friends of Pete Seeger, and so much more like Mother's Day Momentum event.And lovely places to picnic on the grounds before the play - bring your basket and bottle of wine.",Kathleen H
50,Lovely place,"The plays this place puts on are absolutely wonderful! Most of them are Shakespeare's, but there are some others. They also have hilarious improvs worth seeing. The main stage is outdoors and shaded by Topanga's beautiful oaks. The experience is one you will never forget.",noesfine
50,A Magical Space. A wonderful Production!,"We saw a production of a Midsummer Nights Dream at the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum in Topanga Canyon. What a beautiful space to have an open air theater. You are urged to come early and bring a picnic style dinner, and set yourself at one of their tables or benches scattered throughout the property, specifically for that purpose. Very scenic with huge oak trees and other native foliage. There is a booth where you can purchase snacks, beer and wine and other drinkables.Parking is limited in their parking lot, but if you arrive early enough, you can get a spot in their dirt parking lot. They ask for a $5 donation if you park in that lot. Otherwise, you will need to park on Topanga Canyon, and walk to the driveway, and walk down the slope to the theater.The theater itself is beautiful, open air, bench-style seating. Bring a tush pad, just sayin. It is easy to see from just about every seat. There is a huge oak tree right in the middle of the stage. So beautiful and peaceful.Now, as for the production, it was fantastic. There was great energy and the talent was dispersed between trained Shakespearean actors, and those in training.I would highly recommend making an evening of it during one of your own summer's nights to enjoy a magical production of their Mid Summer Nights as well!",Barry K
50,Perfect Setting For Events/Shows/Theater,"This venue was impressive in that it is versatile and in a beautiful setting. The history (if you are old enough to remember the ""Walton's"" TV show) is certainly as interesting as the place itself. With the lack of rain, be advised that this is an open air venue, and is warmer during the day, cools off at night, and right now is, as many spots in the canyon somehow pulling through the lack of water. Even with this in mind, and please do be mindful, things are very dry, it remains a special spot in the Canyon that locals love and visitors who find it, are in for a treat. Check the website for events that may be going on while you are there (visiting the Canyon) as they change frequently.",JulieTherese_11

50,Incredible Live Theater Under the Oaks,"We attended the Shakespearean play "" Titus Andronicus"" last night at the Theatricum Botanicum. It was our first visit and we will definitely return! The quality of the acting was first rate and the atmosphere is unique to Southern California and Topanga Canyon in particular. The entry is a bit hidden, but the entire facility is hidden in the woods and evokes a childlike wonderment as you follow the pathway into the outdoor theater area. There is something about seeing live theater in the open air that makes the audience feel more like part of the production.We learned that there is a youth program as well as an additional 88 seat theater area for the youth plays and more intimate productions including music. This is a fabulous enrichment experience for everyone in the area!Go! Donate! Support this amazing repertory group in this fantastic setting!",Pat C
50,Fun time!,"Great place to watch theater. Acting was top notch. Parking is a little challenge, but this place is worth the small inconvenience. Of having to walk a block or so. Bring a pillow (to sit on) and a blanket (especially in the winter months). The staff was very friendly. You can really tell that the staff enjoy what they do and want you to be part of the Geer family.",Truevoice
50,Amazing Talent and Location,"What a lovely venue, high up in the Topanga Canyon. Set among a lovely garden and natural, Topanga mountainside. Parking is $5 or others may choose to park along the roadway. There is a small concession stand with snacks and cold drinks. Only water allowed is in the theater due to some pesky yellow jackets. If you arrive early, bring a picnic and your wine and dine in the garden. Tables are available.The theater benches are set up in amphitheater style, with actors utilizing every area of the stage, hillside and walkways to enter, exit and entertain. With this, you really do feel as if you become an intimate observer of the story and performance.We went to see Romeo and Juliet. I appreciated the unique twist of the setting being in Israel and Jerusalem. Such a relevant theme in our world today. The characters were perfect and lovable. How DO you remember all those lines?I cried many times throughout the play. I bet the actors could see my tears, I was so close. I was really touched by the story, particularly with the today's prevailing attitudes towards people of varying cultures towards each other. Let us all love one another.Plan a visit here, you will be so happy you did. If you don't plan a picnic, there are several nice restaurants just down the road.",returnmetokaneohe
50,Awesome Event,Today had an all school field trip to Will Geer's and I must say it was awesome. The children truly enjoyed themselves and was definitely entertained. I can't believe that I have never heard of this venue. I will he back this summer for more fun and entertainment!!!,QueenMamaSyl
50,Beautiful venue and great talent,"This amazing non-profit has been around for decades and is one of the best kept secrets in the Los Angeles area. The venue is in the Topanga Canyon the seating is open air, an experience in itself. The acting is top-notch as is the live music. Treat yourself.",M90290
50,Outstanding theater in sylvan setting,"The Topanga theater puts on a good show in a great setting. The texts are abridged to about 140 minutes, including intermission. The staging is professional and the acting polished. You really cannot go wrong on a summer late afternoon enjoying their productions. We have been going for nearly 30 years and the quality of the experience and productions continue to impress.",BEIreland
50,A Gemstone in the Forest Glen,"I went to Topanga to see ""All's Well That Ends Well"" recently. I hadn't been there in about 7 years. I was just blown away with the absolute beauty and peace that is this Theater Company. We had dinner, a buffet put on by the Theater (extra). It was wonderful. Whether you bring your own picnic or buy their buffet, just strolling the peaceful grounds can go that extra mile in taking you out of the hustle bustle of getting there, or city life and put you into a calmer place.The company of actors are fantastic. The setting for the play takes advantage of the trees and hillside, making you believe that the natural settin might have been built just for the show you're seeing.If you haven't been yet this summer, RUN and buy tickets. Can you imagine Midsummer Night's Dream in such an amazing setting?",Judy S
50,"Shakespeare Comes Alive in Topanga's ""Globe""","The LA area abounds with theater attractions, but experiencing Shakespeare al fresco in an open-air woodland theater like this is near perfection. The drive from LA to the theater in the Topanga Canyon area is interesting and quite a contrast to the feel of the city. It would be hard to find a better way to enjoy a summer evening. You can even add to the experience by bringing a picnic dinner (tables provided in the woods) or by enjoying a buffet dinner in their Gardens. The theater itself is intimate; seating is on benches (bring a seat cushion!) and the stage is set right in the woods - no curtain, minimal props. We saw ""Much Ado About Nothing"" and the setting was just perfect for it. The staging was brilliant and creative, with actors entering and exiting from various points, even from the audience! At the end of the play, the actors were all at stage front, interacting with the audience as we were leaving, thanking us! It's really a magical setting - not The Globe, but certainly a lovely way to FEEL like it could have felt! Two pieces of advice:1. Take the time to read a synopsis of the play (or even better, the whole play!) before you go - it really helped our enjoyment.2. The actors do not use microphones and some project much better than others. Shakespeare's rich dialogue can sometimes get a little lost - so get as close as you can to the stage, especially if hearing is an issue for you!",flowerlady28
50,Amazing experience !!,"This is truly a unique experience !! Shakespeare at open air is magical ! I didn`t understand most of the text, as I`m Brazilian, but I noticed that most natives didn`t either :-) But it really does`t matter !",KarinPOA
50,Enchanting!,"I can't believe I've lived in LA 37 years, and this is the first time I've been to Theatricum! The woodland setting is perfect for Shakespeare--you get transported to another world. I can't wait to see ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" here. Bring a light wrap; it does get cool after sunset. Also, bring a cushion to sit on; the bleacher seats get pretty hard pretty fast.",ladyviking_7
50,Magical Theater under the Oaks and Stars -- Heavenly!,"The Theatricum Botanicum is a truly unique experience!! You feel as though it is theater as it was intended to be -- old time stories woven magically in a campfire-like setting -- the woods play a role in each play and the audience feels transported to another place and time. Forget all the high tech -- this has the wind in the trees, the rays of the sun filtering through each scene, or perhaps the shadowy night with the moon overhead! No roof! No limit to the magic! It evokes the pure spirit of ""The Bard"" in the creative staging and glorious work of the magnificent actors who pour their hearts and wit into every performance. Consistent quality and thought-provoking works. Small enough setting where you can be right up close to the performance and really see the actors work. We have a yearly family ritual to see Midsummer Night's Dream. Hubby and I like to go for date night to the more serious plays. And, in addition to the classic theater, we just went with another couple to see the improv group, OFF THE GRID -- what a hilarious way to spend a Friday night!Classes, readings, kids summer camps -- a lot of culture going on with people who are thinking deeply about the world, and having quite a bit of fun while they're at it. Very cool. Highly recommended!",Whitney M
50,Outdoor theater in the woods in LA,"I see all the productions at Theatricum every summer. The actors are fabulously talented, and the venue is such a break from the LA urban-ness. The prices are great for live theater: $37 tops, and there are almost always tickets available. The season goes from June through September, with plays every weekend at night and in the afternoons.I've already seen Lear (with Ellen Geer starring as Queen Lear, and it's not weird; it's inspired), Midsummer Night's Dream (especially great for kids), and All's Well that Ends Well (rarely performed live) with an interesting racial dimension added. Much Ado About Nothing opens in a couple weeks, and I'll be there too. This is turning into an especially strong season. All Shakespeare, and comprehendible, too.They have an awesome education program too--for kids, teens, young professional actors, and adults. Education has always been one of their emphases. Kids learn from the actors they see in the professional productions.",Carrie B
50,Lear!,"Theatricum Botanicum is breathtaking! Surrounded in the canyon's 360 degrees cocoon of trees, we witnessed a new.. Lear. This thoughtful gender switch interpretation of Shakespeare's King Lear gives this play new perspective and dimension. This is ""theater in the surround"". The actors and staging unexpectedly come at you from all sides, behind, above, from the sides. Very unique and exciting! Ellen Geer's direction and portrayal of Lear is nothing less than masterful! Staging in the outdoor canyon theater is not to be missed! Don't forget to bring a blanket as it can get a little chilly in the canyon towards the end!",Jasmer
50,Magical,"You have to take it context - it's not Broadway - it's regional theater. But that said, it's a great experience under the stars and the oaks.Hard seats - bring a pad to sit on!",TopangaTraveler
50,"Have an ""Enchanted evening""!","We go to see a play @ Theatricum Botanicum each summer, not only because we live close by, but mainly because it is such a wonderful experience all around. starting with the picnic with snacks and wine at the tables outside near the parking lot under trees... then the theatre itself is amazing, the acting superb! The last play we saw this year was Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew, which was funny, fast paced and very entertaining, with Willow Geer in the title role. I can highly recommend this venue. Bring: picnic stuff, pillow to sit on, blankets 'n warm clothes if you're going for the evening show. Topanga nights get chilly!",Skinmeister
50,Go!!!!,"We saw A Midsummer Nights Dream this evening, in these magical surroundings. The cast were excellent, and Puck's engagement with the audience made my daughters night! Both my children loved it and for their first introduction to Shakespeare (age 6 and 9), they come out buzzing.This is a magical evening, which you can start with a picnic in the beautiful, magical gardens. Curiously they weren't sold out... But should have been!",Marie954
50,Shakespeare for the common man.,"We went to a Sunday afternoon performance of the Taming of the Shrew. Top notch acting performances in a lovely outdoor setting shaded by ancient oak trees. Even though the temperature in nearby Woodland Hills was over 100, it was a much cooler 80 degrees here and very comfortable with a slight breeze at the 3:30 PM performance. Bring seat cushions or rent theirs for $1.00. Seats do have backs - all seats have good views. I am slightly hard of hearing but had no trouble understanding any of the dialog. Arrive early and park on Topanga Canyon for free, otherwise it is $5 per car. Lots of tables in the garden area to bring food and drinks (alcohol is allowed to be brought in).",cheryl n
50,"Great, quirky music under the stars","Every so often John C. Reilly (and friends) performs at this outdoor theater. We caught a performance on Friday night, a 40th anniversary fundraiser for the Theatricum Botanicum in Topanga. I'm not a folk music fan, especially of old American traditional music, bluegrass and the like but it absolutely grabbed me. It was wonderful. Featuring great talents like Becky Stark, Willie Watson (an amazing banjo player), Tom Brousseau and some others, it was incredibly unique. It helps that the whole thing took place in the Topanga outdoors, amidst the trees. We even had a bird sing-a-long. The outdoor theater has sharply banked seats so all the seats are good. I've also attended various plays at the theater and they are nearly always excellent. The grounds are welcoming -- there are tables and chairs for picnics and wine before the show. They sell very limited food and drink items (water and wine, no coffee or dessert). In typical Topanga fashion they might not have you enter the theater at the time indicated or start on time. Bring your patience.",HuntressCA
50,Equity Theatre Under Majestic Oaks - What a Night!,"Pack a box lunch and a bottle of wine and head over to the Theatricum to enjoy the grounds before the 8:00 pm show. The setting is wonderful and the performances engaging. High quality theatre in a magical setting, how perfect!",TopangaMalibu
