50,"Quaint, but worth your time!","Step back in to time to this little slice of history in San Pedro, California. It is not often, that you see a house that has been MOVED (twice) to preserve it's historical value when the city/ port around it is being expanded.I visited during a quilt show and stayed to join the tour. Simply lovely and worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LouiseASL
40,Small Historic House,"The Muller House Museum isn't large, but we enjoyed our visit. This is the third location for this small house that now sits on a bluff overlooking Los Angeles Harbor. Edward Mahar had the house built in 1899 for his parents who chose not to move in. It was then bought by William Muller in 1901 and the family owned it until 1963 when they donated it to the San Pedro Bay Historical Society. The current site is small with a small garden to the south. The tour takes you through the living room, dining room, kitchen, and the two upstairs bedrooms and takes about an hour. The tour covers the Muller family and some of the history of the area.The gift shop has some small antiques and other inexpensive souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
