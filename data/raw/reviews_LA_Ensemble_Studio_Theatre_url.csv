50,Ensamble Studio Theater,I saw a production of a play that was s good as any Broadway show I've ever seen. I've been back a number of times and have never been disappointed,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stay683633
40,Nice local theater,"The Theater: There are three small theaters. Very nice courtyard with seating area. They do sell beverage and snacks. Another nice local community theater. Since the theater is kind of small, very intimate setting and every seat is a good seat. You get to see the performers up close.The Parking: Private lot and street parking. There is residential area close to the theater so many street parking (free).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILoveFoodComa
50,Great brunch & theatre,"We found this by accident whilst looking online for something to do that was non-touristy. We didn't want to see a Broadway show, but something a bit more intimate and raw. Booked online the night before and was so glad, as there were people on the waiting list when we arrived the next day. We were lucky enough to be at one of their monthly brunch events and it was a treat! There was all you could eat buffet brunch whilst waiting for the shows to start and an all you could drink open bar serving mimosas and fruit juice. The venue was intimate and fabulous. The shows by emerging playwrights were brilliant. The food was delicious. The audience were super friendly and we were the only tourists in the place. It was such fantastic value for money and turned out to be one of my favourite experiences of our whole two week trip to New York! If you get the chance to go to this, don't miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chocsxxx
40,Excellent acting,"Having read a review, we went to the Ensemble Studio at the Atwater Village Theatre to see The Ugly One by a mid-20thC German playwright. The play itself is fun and ok but the acting was truly excellent. We are from the Bay Area (and like the only other review that I see here on TA) it is a pleasure to go to a small theatre with good acting. That is very much absent in the Bay Area so we appreciate it all the more. It was also interesting to find the Atwater Village neighborhood and I'll have to learn more about that. This theatre is an absolutely teeny space so be prepared to be literally on stage with the actors, all four of whom were superior to anything that we see in the Bay Area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nurealam
50,Superb Theater!!,"My wife & I attend a ridiculous number of plays each year including subscriptions to Berkeley Rep & Aurora & Berkeley, Oregon Shakespeare Theater in Ashland, OR, The Shaw and Stratford in Ontario, Canada & New York City. But nothing we've seen this year was as good as ""The Many Mistresses of Martin Luther King"" by Andrew Dolan at the Ensemble Studio in Los Angeles. The writing, directing, casting and acting are absolutely first rate. We found it to be a nearly perfect evening of theater and cannot recommend it too strongly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markmd
