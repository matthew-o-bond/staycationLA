40,Wax Museum Visit,The wax work here was very good but it would be a very short attraction to complete. Staff were friendly and there was a good souvenir shop.It would be great to see more themed displays rather than solo characters from various productions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/notions
50,On the list of to do's,"Very well done. It's small but one of those must do's in L.A. I loved the Michael Jackson wax figure, some of them are very life like.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChampagneEyes
30,Not as good as madame t,The value is good as part of the 3 ticket pass for guinness and Ripley's but it's not as good as madame tussauds for wax figure quality.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agt96
50,Amazing,This wax museum is amazing! They have all our faves and they look so real! The staff were friendly and fun and just added to our amazing experience!Highly recommend!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/128hillaryr
50,Thoroughly enjoyable visits to both attractions.Highly Recommended.,"We bought VIP tickets which cost an extra USD10 each which allowed entry to these two attractions PLUS to Ripley's Believe It or Not exhibition. The first two were interestesting and fascinating, but Ripley's whilst interesting was less so than the other two.- Hollywood Wax Museum. I don't think the wax models were are good in terms of likeness as those at our earlier visit to Madame Tussaud's but what we liked particlularly was that at many of the models, there was a props section - hats, scarves etc. which visitors are allowed to use to enhance their photographic experience. Also each model had a plate with a brief CV/Resume which was helpful. Highly Recommended.- Guiness World Records Museum. Fascinating throughout with many opportunities for practical exercises to pit your skills againsts those of other visitors of the day, the record breakers at this venue and the world records. Great fun. Highly Recommended.- Ripley's Believe It or Not. Worth visiting as part of the VIP package but not as good as the first two attractions.Oveerall a great day out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaellK524GY
20,We had a good time but only because we were laughing at the waxworks so much,"Oh man some of these waxworks are BAD. We were laughing the whole way around. Why are they all so skinny? There's not much to do in Hollywood and if you get this as part of a combo ticket it's worth the laugh but don't go out of your way,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HBRoxx
40,Interesting..,"Bought the triple package (Wax museum, Ripley's, and Guinness). It's worth it for a great way to spend a few hours especially when you have kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Glitter_In_My_Soul
50,Last-minute but fun,"My husband and I were in town just for a few days and having fun in Hollywood. We came across this museum and decided to go in on spur of the moment. I think we both had tons more fun than we ever expected. We didn't know they would have props so you could pose with the wax figures, and we did almost every one. Most of them were spot-on in likeness too! The horror section (pictured) was a cool surprise. We had a great time and would definitely recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TracyC4242
40,"It's kitchy, but it's fun","We did the 3 for one entrances to the wax museum, ripley's, and the guiness world records museums. They are all a little out dated, but I still found them entertaining. There was plenty to do and lots of interactive experiences available. The wax figures need some updating, but we really enjoyed seeing all the weird stuff in these museums. I'm glad we decided to do it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hans3595
40,Worth it for the triple package,"My wife and I bought the triple package (Wax Museum, Guinness and Ripley's) and it's a pretty solid deal for the price, especially considering the individual pricing. We had a few hours to kill before we moved onto other touristy stuff and overall I'm glad we came here. A few of the reviews have mentioned how bad some of them are (which is true) but the majority of them are pretty impressive, if not a little creepy in their realism. I'm a horror buff so I really enjoyed going through their horror tunnel that sidetracks in the beginning. For anyone curious about that, there's a sign that warns ""not for the faint of heart"", but there's nothing that I would consider to be scary or too intense for most people (some noises, but nothing pops out). We had a lot of fun navigating our way through here and enjoying the uncanny valley that is wax sculpting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RSzklarz
40,Nice place,"I don't know about the others wax museuns, so I can't compare with them, anyway it is recommended if you buy the VIP tickets (Ripley, Guinness and Wax museum), some sculptures are really amazing",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danquinb
30,Funniest hour of the trip,"I found myself with time to kill on Hollywood Boulevard and being A. Solo and B. the wrong side of my mid thirties, I decided to fling $35 at the Hollywood Wax Museum, Ripley’s and Guinness World Records triple. I’m probably not the target market for these, for the afore mentioned reasons, and also because I have eyes. Little did I know, however, what hilarious delights awaited me in this waxy temple. I first began to question the quality of the wax works when I mistook Robin Williams for my uncle Bob. Jack Sparrow wasn’t too bad, but it took a lot of squinting to see that Sean Connery was meant to be Sean Connery. It was around Meryl Streep and Jennifer Lawrence that the hilarity really set in. I’d say they look 85% like the people, if the people had been stunned and dipped in an apple glaze. The Hollywood Bowl room was an ever increasing pleasure. Both I and the other people in the room had to refer to the sign to work out who the shiny man on the end was (George Clooney) and I’m still laughing about Julia Roberts and Sandra Bullock now. My absolute favourite, without a shadow of a doubt though, has to be Jennifer Aniston. I had to refer to the, signage to understand it was her, of course and have since thrown it open to an Instagram review. 100% of respondents thought it looked more like Christina Applegate, so my advise to Hollywood Wax Museum would be, just change the label on that one. My advice to anyone reading this is to definitely go. I honestly mean this when I say it was the funniest hour I’ve had for a long, long time. My cheeks hurt from lolling by the time I got outside and it was worth every cent for the pleasure of that. Happy waxing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/njh108
20,Time for some updates,This place was really outdated and in need of some content upgrades. For the entrance price it was a disappointment and we were only in the place approx. 30 minutes. I’m sure in the late 90’s this was a hot place based off the material that’s being presented.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fpoblue2
40,"""Could Have Been Better""","A little disappointing but there you go, we were only there for an hour, that was enough the figures displayed did not appear as life-like as we were expecting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Explore694115
20,Not impressed. NOT CHILD/STROLLER FRIENDLY,"First time in LA. Dirty, crowded, ugly city. Museum was pretty small, was done in 30 minutes. I went with my husband and 2 small children. Toddlers. Not stroller friendly, very small walking spaces. Not many wax figures. Was not impressed with the quality of the figures. It was not busy at all and still way too crowded for the small space provided. Couldn't enjoy myself being in such a hurry to be courteous letting others through as well. While others weren't courteous taking too much time taking pictures and having us wait a long time. Don't go, you're missing absolutely nothing! not exciting or even interesting. Only positive thing I'd say is the price. I did the VIP 3 museums package and I thought 35 wasn't bad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bekib1618
30,It is not that special,"There is nothing special about this wax museum small and doesn’t have much figures. The pros about it that you could take picture as much as you want, and there are few accessories here and there to dress up with your star. When you buy tickets from third party as google or trip advisor and groupons make sure you look at the date, those tickets are not valid for the day of purchase rather after 48 hours! I had to cancel my google purchase, and get them from the museum for $45 extra for our group.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelermomus
30,Not Bad,This is our first visit to a was museum. The props were outstanding but the characters were less than 50% accurate. I was pretty disappointed but it was still a fun place to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tamedlovers
50,Hollywood Wax Museum,"Did the VIP ticket with this museum, world records museum, and Ripley's Believe it or Not. Definitely worth it to do all three. Fun times with for a family",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daniellZ4111RW
30,Not bad on the VIP Package of 3,"Since we didn't pay much by buying the Ripley's-Guinness-Wax Museum package, it was fine. The quality of the displays was good, but many of the celebrities were not good images. Surprised with all the software around that they couldn't do better. The kids (7 to 12) had fun posing with the singers and a few icons.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parrishh2013
40,Fun experience,I’d never been to a wax museum so I really enjoyed it. I’m sure it’s just like the rest though. Definitely recommend the 3 museum pass.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jim723
40,Super fun!,The wax figures are so realistic and it was a great visit! I would recommend for families. It is great entertainment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wanderlust9800
30,Same as the rest,"I got sucked into buying a VIP ticket to see three museums. This was not one I was planning to see, and I wish I hadn't spent more on VIP. The wax figures were pretty much the same ones in the same poses as the museum in TN, and some are very poorly done. If you have already seen one of these, don't waste your money again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P1214KLkimberlyd
40,Real or wax? Great settings and photo ops with your favorite stars!,We toured Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum and were very disappointed. The next day we toured the Hollywood Wax Museum - what a difference! Many of the stars at MT's were not realistic - facial features were not true. Hollywood Wax Museum's settings & lighting brought realism to the characters and most were very true to life. We went early in the day and saw a makeup artist touching up various stars - interesting to watch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeepPurple110
40,Worth It!,"Visited the wax museum, Ripley's, and Guinnes World Records. Trip was worth it. It is a good way to spend the day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3392RWdaniela
40,Do the VIP deal.,"This was a rough one to rate because value has to go into account. I happened to get tickets in a fundraising auction that also got me into the Guinness World Record museum across the street. At the regular $25.99 price, I probably would have given this only 2 stars. BUT there is an option that is $35 for both museums PLUS the Ripley’s Believe It Or Not Museum (which I didn’t go to) and that is a much better deal... so this review assumes you did that.The wax museum was fun. There are a lot of cool scenes and a lot of selfie stations with props (that one can only hope are thoroughly washed). The wax figures themselves aren’t nearly as good as what I remember at the NY Madame Tussaud’s. Those were unreal and these are more like... oh... I see it. But it was still very fun and the scenes were cool. It definitely has that janky charm. You’re not going to spend more than an hour here so that’s why you should really hit all three of the museums.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage
50,Excellent activity for the whole family- we all found a favorite celeb,"Great last minute activity that could take as long as you like. Well positioned, and entertainingly posed celebrities. Definitely will be part of our regular activity on future trips.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SamCunningham
50,Wow,All three are worth the money. My son and I had a lot of fun going thru the attractions. We spent about 2hours smiling and laughing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanaAMiller
50,Fun!,Our group had tickets to see this attraction as part of a package with bus touring tickets. We really weren't expecting to spend much time in here but once inside we were having so much fun posing with the figures with the costume props. There is a huge ball pit in one of the areas that is great for photo opportunities. The figures are very realistic looking here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleynslater
40,Quick Activity,We bought the three ticket package with the Guiness and Ripley's because my boyfriend really wanted to go see what they had to offer. It was fun but the displays are quite old and run down. Madame Tussauds is much more realistic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WhereIsAshley
30,Quick highlights of favorite entertainers.,Short on time? You can easily go through this place in 25 minutes. You can take photos with the figures. Popular place you might have to wait a little bit but fun to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/artfulbella
40,Tots recommend!,"My boyfriend and I recently just went 4/3/19 I believe. We enjoyed so much not only can you take pictures with the wax figures but there is also props that you can use with certain wax figures. It would have been great to see a little bit more celebrities but it was all good they have a scary section with wax figures of famous horror movies let me tell you I thought something was going to pop out on me it kept on my toes those figures looked very realistic but others don't. The ending is amazing with music and many lights. Overall, it's a great place to go and take pictures and hangout!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vcruz7597
50,Fun Spot,The figures are so lifelike. This was a fun place to visit and stir a little nostalgia. Expect to spend a half hour or so and take lots of pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/706scottn
20,Nothing like I expected.,The price was like $22.95. I think that was way to much for what the museum had to offer. Without reading who the celebrities were I did not know who they were. We were a big group and was done with the tour of the museum in about 20 mins.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shkdav7
50,Wonderful Experience,"Enjoyed the wax museum, first time visiting one. Totally hilarious! Some of the figures were very realistic, some were right on but some need a re-do. Still, it's a must visit if you are in the LA area. The props were cool too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LadeeVee
50,Had a blast,My son and I loved this place. Using the props to take pictures with the “Stars” was so much fun! Loved that it was handicap accessible.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatsyRV
30,"Cool place, but bad celebrity interpretations!","Got a VIP ticket for all three of the venues. So not a bad deal, but wax figures do not really come close to actual celebrities. Had to look at info cards to see who half of them were! Museum is clean and nicely set up so worth a trip if you are there, since Ripley’s is included and that is very cool!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/964aliciac
40,Good quick fun,We are in LA on our honeymoon and purchased the VIP bundle tickets and had a lot of fin With the props & taking pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cbutler2713
50,Fun on a budget!,This was a great place to visit when you're on a budget. Me and my family had a blast walking through the museum and taking pictures with the wax figures and props!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/269sheilav
30,it's a place you definately have to visit,there is plenty of figures with different settings and themes although many are not as good as they can be it's okay I suggest kids up to 12 should not pay because most likely they don't take pictures or anything,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H9364GHandreaa
30,Budget wax museum,If you want to see some wax figures and you are on a tight budget. This is the place to go. We went to this one first and then to Madam Tussaud’s after. There is a huge difference in quality and workmanship.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mnako
20,below average when comparied to others,"In comparison with 2018 version Madame Tussauds wax museum, ""Hollywood Wax Museum"" is below average. Some of the figures were hopelessly off, either in color or design. For example, actress Meryl Streep's face was gray in color, which is unacceptable and there is no excuse for this. I suppose in the 1960s or 1970s, their figures might have passed as good enough. But not in this day and age of M. Tussauds top-notch look. I paid $22.99 for entry fee. For bang-for-the-buck, they should charge $2 or $5 maximum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimgR975BH
50,Like being part of a Hollywood set,My family and I went there and took pictures with the life sized status.. We included the pics on our family tree..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gwendolynn176
30,Posing with the stars!,"It was fun to pose with the figures of stars like Robin Williams, The Rock, Denzel Washington, Robert Downey Jr, and quite a few more. Was disappointed that the price was so high for a relatively quick experience, we where there just under an hour. Best part was laying on the bed with Hugh Hefner! HAHA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/611jenifern
50,From George Vreeland Hill,A must-see experience when visiting Hollywood.The wax figures look real and there are enough of them to fill an Academy Awards show.A really fun place just full of photo-ops.George Vreeland Hill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeVreelandHill
10,‘A Big Disappointment’,"I finally went to see this place. It was over price for what you see. We were very disappointed in what we saw the figures/ statues. The faces did not look like the stars, too fat too skinny also too much makeup on. It was s joke we were laughing all the way thru it. Some of the costumes were really worn out they need to be fixed repaired. The place just seemed old and dirty. We would not recommend this place. Sorry, maybe Florida might be better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goshop58
40,Fun!,"Walking to see the stars, we decided to go in. It was all good. Jennifer Aniston looks so old, they didnt do justice for her. And Julia Roberts was not listed. But over all, we had a lot of fun with the props!!The reason I dont give 5 stars is because the booth ticket guy was offering the VIP, we refused since our time was limited, he insisted, we said no thanks again, he then rolled his eyes and said ""ok, whatever"" under his breath. I ignored it, I don't have time for negativity. I know he doing his job, but that's not the way to treat someone for their decisions. Just move on. But once we stepped into those doors... Now, that's another story! Just dont walk thru it. Take your time w the props! Its worth it! Create your own and funny memories!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/549abbyr
30,Its ok once,"It is ok to visit once to say you have been there, its a bit cheesy & there are better places to visit in Hollywood",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/57chevycustom
30,The Kids Enjoyed It,It was a fun way to fill in some time. But I wouldn't say its a must do. It seems to be a little bit run down. But overall the kids enjoyed it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kay343
50,Unexpected fun visit,"We got the combo ticket for Ripley and the Wax museum. The Wax museum was a nice surprise. Kids adored the props, which add fun to taking pictures. The horror section was also very nice. Loved it more than the Madam Tusso museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oritv2015
30,Disappointing,"Hollywood was very dirty and run down. The wax museum had some cool figures. Wouldn't plan a vacation to go there, but since in the area we went. My teenage grandkids hardly knew any of the wax figures",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rtjjeda7
50,Must do attraction,Great attraction. The horror section is the best. Worth the cost. Parking available in a garage on the next street over. Park and walk. Located on the Blvd. great for families.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1stpriority
40,Must do for anyone that has not been to one,"We did all three museum's with one ticket (much better deal). This is a must do for anyone that has not seen one before. Me, my wife, and 11 year old son had a great time taking photos will all the stars. The only issue was my son didn't know who 90% of the people were.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DMTitan
50,Family fun,"We went here with the 3 museum ticket and this was our favorite by far! We had 5 kids from age 2 to 14 and they had so much fun taking pictures with all the props and statues! Most of them look pretty realistic, a few do not look like the person at all. I would highly recommend stopping here for a great experience. And the women working at the ticket counter were extremely nice!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/422amya
50,Our Hollywood trip,We had a good time!Took a lot of photos! Sum of the wax figures don't look like their conter parts like Beyonce and I dream of Jeannie!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q3055EBcarolt
30,3 Museum,"It was fun, I got the ticket to go in to Ripley's, Wax Museum and the Record Guinness, Ripley was my favorite, Record Guinness was my least favorite.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindaViz
40,"Fun and creative, loved the props to add to experience",Overall I grade the museum as a fun light hearted activity. Choices of celebrities were a bit light. Some of the figures were dead on and others not so clear. We had a fun-filled 30+ minutes of photo ops and laughs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/XSNRG87
40,"Enjoyed It, But it Was a Little Short","We bought the ticket 3 pack that included the Riple's and Guinness Museums. We enjoyed the wax museum the most out of the three. We did Madame Tussauds last year and this wax museum wasn't quite as good, but still fun. Most of the wax figures were pretty realistic with a few exceptions. It seemed to be significantly shorter than Madame Tussauds, though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PowerTrippersTravel
30,Horror section is the best!!,"Buy the pack where you can visit 3 museums (Ripley's, wax hollywood and Guinnes record)We did it! Our favorite section was the horror one...It really scared!! The other statues aren't good qualities ( you have to visit Madame Tousaand for best quality)It's nice if you go with your family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cote-Va-Chile
10,Poor Celebrities,"We visited this venue on one of our spare days on holidays. After speaking to the sales assistant, we believed that this would be a good attraction as the exterior was appealing. However, after entering the museum we realised that this was not the case. Several of the figures did not look like the celebrities which made us feel disappointed. I will admit that there were some that looked similar, but not the majority of them. I would have to say the highlight was the Ninja Turtles, but we had finished walking around the attraction in under 15 minutes which was not ideal. I personally would not recommend this attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jlevans15
50,Lots of fun!,"Our first visit to Hollywood. We had so much fun. I have visited several wax museums and this one was very interactive, I guess for being in Hollywood. There are a lot of wax figure and you can dress up with them. The entrance was very cool as they take your photos. My children age 3 and 7 had a blast as we spent several hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mike2009SanAntonio
40,Sobrepaso mis expectativas,"Al principio sentía que algunos de las celebridades estaban casi vivas. me encanto poder tomar fotos con ellas. muy real, trabajo muy bien hecho. At first it was kind of creepy being seated next to Simon C.... It was amazing, i enjoyed every step. Nice been able to have pictures taken with the celebrities.... wax ones lol...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T1883VQjoses
50,So life like,"We actually received a 50% off coupon from some of the staff. Fantastic experience and so life like, the 4D show is a must. Our favourite celebrity was Robin Williams, they were able to capture the sadness in his eyes that bought a chill up our spine! Great experience for all ages and your able to have a bit of fun with different costumes and props. Loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trippingx3
50,2017 California Visit,"It was a nice tour if you like to see replicas of movie stars. Some look very real. Was told the difference between all of the wax museums was that they all have there own themes. Las Vegas , New York, Washington DC. A little pricey but overall an interesting tour. Be sure your camera is fully charged to take pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/981perryg
30,Quick comfortable stop,"As part of our Ripley's Believe it or not Tickets we visited the Hollywood wax museum. For our younger children one section was too scary, for our teens they loved it. It only took about an hour to go through, many of the figures have props beside them, the kids enjoyed this. It was well set up, air conditioned and many well known celebrity figures. Some weren't so well crafted. Staff weren't very friendly or helpful. We had parked on the next street for a flat rate of $20, as we were also visiting the Hollywood walk of fame, Ripley's Believe it or not and the Chinese Theatre. The Hollywood museum is on the opposite corner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MedusasRiot
40,Just OK,"A bit pricey and I thought we would get to see more out of this Wax Museum in specific since it is the Hollywood wax museum and not any other! Our tour was so quick and we just had to go out right away , didn't find anything so special about it....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Malnaser
10,Not worth the money,Not worth $36 per person I mean come on!! It takes you 15min to do the walk thru this is a rip off seriously.. don’t go there save your money!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/88Martinez
20,Unrealistic,"We decided to go to the Hollywood Wax museum on the last day of our visit to LA , it was hot so we wandered through the museum to cool down . I must say they weren't very realistic at all in fact quite ugly. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time or money , I would go to Madam Tussauds",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Agnus10
40,Nice place to relax for an hour,"We bought the combined ticket for ""Hollywood Wax Museum"" + ""ripley's believe it or not"" + ""guinness museum"" and it was quite a good deal ($28).The place is very nice and for some of the figures they prepared matching accessories so the pictures that you take will look more authentic.Kids loved to take pictures with the figures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Udi-aslan
50,Adorable experience !,"Definitely enjoyed my time there ! We came just before the museum closing hour. But had the best hour and a half ever! Figures are so realistic! You have a chance to take lots of cool pictures, they even offer clothing other decorations! There is a horror hall, and other cool fancy halls with all the most famous artists. I recommend this place for everyone ! Would be a shame if you guys leave LA without visiting this super awesome place !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauruze
40,Fun for all,I came here with my family of 4 while on vacation and I have to say that we all liked it very much. The wax figures were very entertaining. You were also able to wear some of the props that went with that character's movie. Even my teenage kids loved it. We felt that it was fun for all . I really enjoyed the horror movie characters they were cool . We bought the multiple ticket that allows you to visit 3 places for only a few bucks more. Would definitely recommend and return,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lous593
40,Fun For The Kids,"The tour was fun with all of the interactive things that you could do with the figures. I believe that the was figures at the wax museum down the street, Madam Tussauds was just a better done more realistic. This wax museum was a fun interactive but you could tell that it was not as good as quality as the other. Since I have now been to both I would say if you want to see more lifelike to to Madam Tussauds and if you have young children maybe Hollywood Wax Museum will be better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thekingofswapmeets
50,Lots of fun!,"My family (wife with two kids aged 10 and 12) visited here in July 2017.As part of our visit to Hollywood, we visited the Hollywood Wax Museum on a weekday morning after walking down Hollywood Blvd and touring the El Capitain theater.Tickets had been purchased online in advance (along with admission to the Guiness Museum which was only so-so). This wax museum was a ton of fun! The wax figures are very life-like and for the most part are dead-on in terms of their celebrity likeness. It felt they could come alive at any moment.The props were a fun touch when posing with our favourite characters. There were so many to see that everyone in the family had a blast with their favourites along the way. My wife loved the Hugh Hefner one lying in his bed. The kids loved the pop singers - Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, etc.There is one (optional) section dedicated to horror movies that may prove too scary to younger children.We really enjoyed our visit and would recommend it to others.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dms666
30,Just a little boring,We took a fast tour into the museum. Is similar to Madame Tussaud museum; not so expensive. Recommended only if spare time available; mainly for child!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmanueleCae
50,So Much Fun,"This place is great!!! Had so much fun taking pictures with the props. All parts of it were great. Went for my sons 18th Birthday, will definitely go back",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReneMartin65
40,I had a good time,This was a decent price to go and look and some of my favorite stars molded to perfection. The staff was very friendly . We took pictures with most of the wax figures there which seemed lifelike. If you are visiting LA this is a good place to go,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/talithac789

40,Fun with props included!,"We purchased a ticket for Ripleys, The Guinness World Records museum and Hollywood Waxworks. The cost was $30 per adult and $20 per child, and we felt it was great value for money!This was so much fun! Most of the waxworks included a prop for you to take a picture with. The lighting is awful for photographs, however my kids loved visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Superdella
40,Pretty cool,This place is actually pretty cool! I ended up touring my own city and came to this business. The prices are way too high but I really enjoyed seeing all of the wax figures. Everything does look real and the people they have figures of are relevant. I would not come back but glad I came one time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adrianla1331
20,Less than average,"Located on Hollywood Blv. and in the city of stars, I've would have expected much more. Many of the wax figures are only recognizable because of their name signs and there are way to few taken the prize into consideration. But ok. If you never been in a wax museum before, it might be worth your money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2009anders
50,Great time!,"Great variety of wax celebrity figures, fun props, and the perfect amount of time! Well worth it and fun for the whole family!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenl19
40,Kids loved it!,"My kids really enjoyed the sculptures. Of course they didn't recognize all of them, but the stars were pretty recent so it wasn't a huge issue. I loved that they offered props for them to use while we took pictures like a black leather jacket and sunglasses to wear with the terminator. This made for some really great pictures. It was a great way to spend some time while my wife shopped Hollywood Boulevard.Even though they are always adding other celebrities to the displays we will probably not come back any time soon. I do recommend you try the place at least once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joserR4746XD
50,Kids had a blast,This was the highlight of LA for my kids. We spent a good bit of time inside posing and taking pics with the wax statues. So life like. They do a great job of setting them up in rooms themed for the time that person was known for. I was told it was a must by a friend and he was right. Also buy tickets on line (on their website) before getting there and you save money.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingDad84
40,Lots of fun,"Had a great time at the hollywood was museum. Paid $29.00 for the wax museum, rigleys believe it or not and the Guinness world records. The fun part was being able to try on props while taking pictures. The horror wall was nice and spooky too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neetasun
40,Fun photos!,Photos with every model is allowed and they provide props!We went early in the day so that we could avoid throngs of people making photography impossible.The horror section is awesome!This is a great way to spend an hour or so.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E128XQalexc
50,GIVE IT A SHOT,"My wife and I attended June 11, 2017. We had a blast. We stopped at Every figure, put on props, took pictures, danced around, did a little singing and acting. IT WAS GREAT. At the end, we took home pictures of us in front of a hollywood sign. The staff was nice!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joannethomas0302
30,Smaller than expected,"Being in Hollywood which is star city, I expected the wax museum to reflect that image. I expected more stars and a good number of them. This place was really small and somewhat crowded. They try and up sell you photos when you go in which is annoying because it's expensive enough to get in. By the way, many people on the street are handing out coupons to lure people into the wax museum--I think they get some commission if you use their coupon. Anyway, the museum gladly accepts the coupons and it's a good savings. As far as the figures in the museum, they have some cool ones like Steven Spielberg, ET, John Travolta, Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump, and Judy Garland.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jojoaz83
30,"If You Have Kids With You, By All Means, Stop There","If you are visiting Los Angeles and have time and have kids under 14, they will love this place. You, on the other hand, will be somewhat bored.it is a wax museum--just like all other wax museums. There is nothing special there. Parking can be a bear and if you park on the street mind the signs, our parking tickets are quite expensive.Before going, make sure to go on line and get a discount ticket, there are many to be found. Don't pay full price, no one does.The location is fun, right in the middle of Hollywood so expect to stay there several hours because there is a lot to see besides the museum.The museum will take you about an hour to get through, the staff is very nice and it is all handicapped accessible.In Hollywood, your wallet is always in your front pocket and no you do not want to buy a thing from a street vendor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
30,Cheesy,"This place is one of those 'so bad it's fun' places. Although to be honest, some of the figures were on par with Madame Tussaud's. Interactive elements add to the fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VacationerGuy
30,Pretty average but worth checking out,"This was pretty average, some of the figures actually looked quite impressive tho. It's a short walk through and it's a bit pricey but overall, pretty average.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/devonh949
40,Cheaper than Madame Tussaults,"We bought the ticket that let us go across the street and see the Guiness World Record museum and the Ripley's Believe It or Not, all for $30. Probably if you only want to see the highest quality wax figures, go to Madame Tussaults for that $30, but it's a good price for all three. This one is the shortest to go through. Some of the figures are not very true to life, but some of them are scary in how like the real person they are. You can take selfie's and use their props if you want-they just don't want you to touch them. Some of the celeb's: Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, Sandra Bullock, Robert Downey Jr, Elvis, John Wayne, Katy Perry, Sean Connery, Indiana Jones, Audrey Hepburn. We spent less than 1 hour and saw it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mel65B
50,Looks so real...,A must see location after the stars on the walk. These are so realistic you have to look twice to be sure. I was shocked at how real they really look and feel.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/henryj939
20,Not even slightly realistic!,"We came here as part of a group but straight away knew that it wasn't going to be as good as we hoped. Our teenagers enjoyed taking selfies with the wax figures but to be honest most of them didn't even look like the real thing & most of the time we had to read the sigh to find out who they were! We liked that they had props that you could use in your photos & the ticket we purchased got us in to the Ripley's museum & the Guiness world record museum as well, these were both a total waste of time, so lucky the ticket wasn't too expensive. I wouldn't bother going back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AWTYblogger
20,Fake,The wax people do not look like the real people. There were many cases where I had to look at the name plate to figure out who it was...and then I was saying to myself that looks nothing like him/her. I was disappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coryv406
10,Vacation,Not very good only a few of the characters look like the actual people. They had a horror side I can't critique that side because man grand daughter is afraid of that stuff,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Atlanta_GATripster
40,Cool kitsch,Very entertaining. So many selfie opportunities it's mind boggling! The horror movie section is a lot of fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steve_O_Rama_73
50,Fun photo ops with props!,"My husband and I took our 10-year-old daughter to the Hollywood Wax Museum for the first time for all three of us. It was fun posing with the wax celebrities. The included props were really cool too! We took a bunch of pictures. Our daughter enjoyed seeing us get excited about most of the statues, but only a few of the featured celebrities my 10-year-old knew. Best for adults...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ravvenesque
30,Almost worth the $20.00,"This place was kinda cheesy! Their ""wax"" statues were not exactly good! Most of the figures didn't look like the person they portrayed. Definitely a tourist attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/712JMLeb
40,Enjoyable!,We bought the VIP promo ticket so it was good value for us to come and visit here. I enjoyed the wax mannequins. I must say they did a great job with Taylor Swift's replica!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TAROTZAMM
50,We had a Blast!,I've always wanted to got o the Was Museum! We got the VIP package which was defiantly worth the price. I do wish there were more statures but over all it was great!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erikasD829DZ
10,Madame Tussards Hollywood is way better,"Cheap enough when you get the three venue ticket combo. However, you can get the entire complex done and seen in 15-20 minutes.I would say that 90% of the models look absolutely nothing like who they are meant to be.Total waste of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheAdmiralW
50,Family fun,"Interesting and informative. Fun times for all ages. Located in the heart of the strip.Suggest if doing this - invest in the three in one tickets- Ripley's believe it or not, guinnes book of world records and the wax museum for $30 eac (or $20each).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/350mickk
20,Waste of time,"I went to this museum after doing the madame tussards one, as it was a free ticket with the Guinness world record one. The figures are so disappointing after seeing the life like ones in madame tussards.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kara929
40,A great laugh but don't expect Madame Tussaud's standard,I discovered this in my research for LA and I was assumed before I visited and was even more assumed during the visit. Don't expect the same standard as Madame Tussaud's as these models are so bad that their funny. It was fun walking around and trying to guess who each model was and then laugh that it didn't look anything like them. Not all of the statues are bad. It was a good laugh and I would recommend it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharmaynes2016
40,Fun! Different.,I have lived here in California for 40 years and never visit TIL now. It was fun and very different.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vhgoudeau
50,Great fun for all,"We visited the wax museum accidentally, thinking it was the more well recognised museum, Madame Tussuards. We were pleasantly surprised. Lots of great props to dress up in, and take photos with the wax figures. We all really enjoyed it and would go back. It's in a great Hollywood Blvd location, and easily accessible by train.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LizF12345
50,A good place for fun with the kids,"We saw this place as part of a three in one deal with two other venues, this is easily the best of the three. Not because the wax models looked particularly real ( a lot didn't , thank heavens for signs indicating who they were ) but there was a great horror section ( give it a miss if you have real little ones ) and a New York sewer section , eg ninja turtles and the like.But the best bit was that probably over half the wax figures had props associated with them. So it sort of didn't matter that Hugh Hefner, John Wayne or Clint Eastwood didn't really look like them, it was fun chucking on the props and having a laugh with the photos taken of each other. Worth a look if you feel like getting in to the dress up side of it .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulBelyndaJosh
40,Fun if you go with someone you want to have fun with,"This place is a great time if you go with other people who want to have fun. I spent a lot of time taking pictures and messing around. If I went alone I doubt I would have done anything besides walk through the place. The figures are pretty cool and the detail is good, but a little creepy in an uncanny valley sort of way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattwA642GO
20,Boring and not life like models,"We bought the combo tickets that included the Guinness Records, Hollywood Wax and Ripleys. Guinness is the worst, followed by Hollywood Wax. Fairly rude and uninterested staff and far from life-like wax models. I haven't been to Madame Tussauds but believe it is remarkably better. There were props available so you could take photos with the 'stars' and that provided a little hilarity but overall I'd go elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMTB
30,So bad it was fun,We bought the combo ticket and were thoroughly disappointed with the Guinness records so our expectations for the wax museum were lower. I think how bad the waxworks were along with the photo props made it a fun 45mins. But it's expensive for what it is.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SpenceyL
50,Great wax of Hollywood fame,"Great place to spend with Kids, liked it, recommand to all friends and folks.Lots of famous people figures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aldo3571
40,Suprise!,"It was pretty awesome, and the degree of effort they put into them to make them look so real was crazy, the ""prop station"" was a really cool idea. What i think would be cool is an interactivr table... where we could make our own little wax statue as a souvenir etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cassParish
40,Fun with more than one person,This was a lot of fun! They look so real! And it was interesting reading their synopsis for each person. The best part is using the props to get fully sick photos bra.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Iddles
40,Good,It had a lot more to do than Madame Tussauds. I bought the VIP ticket for Ripley and Guinness WORLD record. I really liked the horror section and the cute props we used to take photos. Huge Marilyn Monroe fan so hers was my favorite. The wax figures were a little questionable. They didn't really resemble the celebrity they were modeled after and some of the staff were friendly. They took our photo on the way in and we were told we can view them on our way out but upon coming out we were ignored when asked about our photos. Would've loved a memory of our visit. But I guess I'll settle with keeping the ticket as a souvenir.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/victoriar437
30,Cheesy Fun,"We got a pass for three 'attractions'. This was the first we went to. The waxworks can be good, but then again some are questionable. There are lots of chances to use props and take photos. It's a fun way to spend an hour or so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/449kims
50,Loved it,I remember coming here was a child and I've always wanted to take my kids here and I was finally able to share my experience with them ! They loved it just as much as I did,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnaliciaO4
30,It was OK,"I bought the VIP pass for all three museums, Wax, Ripley's and Guinness, which makes the price $10 for each. This one had a lot of horror figures and I'm not sure if that is because I went near Halloween or if it is like that all the time. Anyway I would give it an average at best. I was in and out in about 30 minutes. They are open really late so that is another reason I went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnTheRoadAgain1056
50,Lots of fun...good props,"My adult son and I had a few hours to spare before leaving for our flight home so we paid for VIP tickets for 3 museums: Wax Museum, Ripley's Believe or Not and the Guinness Book of Records. We went to the wax museum and we had a blast. Because we went early, around 9 am, there were no other patrons and we used the props at some of the exhibits without worrying about anyone else waiting in line. The wax figures were pretty good and there were different themes eg. movie stars, horror, athletes, famous singers, western, 007 etc. There was even a wax figure of Hugh Hefner in a bed which you (ladies) can wear some bunny ears and rob and sit lie next to him in bed!. It was worth it and I enjoyed this one museum than the other two museums.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tourisma
30,Average items,The wax museum wasn't what i expected. Very few models and boring. Walked thru in 25 minutes and that's taking poses with the models. They should have more models and a wider variety.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lgladneey
30,Not as good as Madame Tussauds but not as expansive,We went to the Hollywood Wax Museum along with the Ripleys Believe it or not Museum and the Guinness World Records Museum. The ticket to all 3 attractions was $30pp. It was worth going to and you could make out who the was figures were but they were no where near as well done and life like as Madame Tussauds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimB88_13
50,Hollywood Wax Museum,Hollywood Wax Museum in Los AnglesThe ticket cost 20 dollars for adultWhen you go to the museum you see your favorite stars.The address6767 Hollywood BLVD,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Malhammash
40,Fun Place to Visit,"We recently payed a visit to this museum 9/29/16. Compared to several other wax museums I've visited over the years I'd have to say this one was the best.Keep in mind this is a very busy area, so I imagine trying to find somewhere to park would be a nightmare. We used Uber so we were dropped off right in front.We visited on a weekday and thought this area was packed. I can only imagine how busy it must be on a weekend. I mention this because at several of the wax figures we had to wait for others to take their pictures before we could. On weekends I bet this place gets really crowded.You are able to pose with most of the figures which we thought was a lot of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G4264SYmarkb
40,VIP Pass a must,"I too found this attraction to be overpriced on its own, but with the VIP pass it was a great deal for the $30 to see Ripley's and Guinness as well, and I think there are coupons out there that would make it even cheaper (I had a brochure with one but it had expired).No lineups when I visited (a Monday evening), it's true you can zip through in maybe 20 minutes but if you are into taking pictures then you can really spend some time here. They encourage you to put on the available free costumes, use their props so you can take pictures with your favorite stars. If you just want to look, it's quick and enjoyable too. True that some of the figures don't look great while others will make you wonder if they aren't just pranking you with the real actor standing still...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ydnar

40,"If you have extra money, a neat combo museum awaits","This is not a "" must do"" , but if you are looking for something cool to do, that is air conditioned..., this is the spot. Right along a Los Angeles must do ...iconic walk of fame. This small museum is part of the rip keys believe it or not museum, and part of the Guinness book of records museum. As a full combo to see all three, this is a great idea. The wax museum is the perfect selfie spot. We probably stayed 40 minutes, but could of stayed longer. Some great photos with the kids, who all enjoyed it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/22MichaelA22
10,Not worth it,Save your money. The wax figures did not look like the celebrities at all. You can get through the whole museum in 15 minutes. Total waste...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sylviad444

40,VIP Pass only way to go,"VIP Pass for $30 for : Ripley's, Guiness, and Wax Museum. Not worth money alone. I had more fun then kiddos since most stars were more appropriate for older crowd - since they are the bigger stars. Most of them looked good, but some were not true to form. Kids still had fun posing with all the stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joeboo16
50,MR PRESIDENT!!!!!!!!,Hey everyone so the girls and I decided to walk Hollywood blvd and we came across the wax museum and so after the girls bought some gifts from the shop we decided to go in t wasn't too expensive I believe we paid 40 even to get in for the 3 of us we had fun the girls had a lot of fun they nearly died upon seeing Justin beiber lmao again most of my videos were on snap chat as my regular camera wasn't working properly so no videos today but I got a few pics this pit stop was worth it to say we did it most of the wax figures were dead on like Samuel Jackson man if I didn't know it was wax I would've thought it was him but then you had Beyoncé who didn't really look like herself in the face Justin was the highlight for the girls and Katy Perry and Taylor Swift they were really good the haunted part was too scary for my little 1 surprisingly since she watches horror movies like crazy so that was the only part we didn't explore but over all it was great and the girls got to shake hands with the president they went bonkers as soon as they saw him they ran and hugged him I thought it would fall over lol ooooo there is also props u can put on or use for picture so would I recommend this??? Yes of course I mean it's on the blvd and the only way unless u wait around to see celebs so have a look take a pic and enjoy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KerryDezzy

50,Awesome Place,Must do this with Madame Tussauds and Riplely's believe it or Not. Some good figures that really match the person but there are some that don't. Really fun experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leyshao
20,Horrible,It is very disappointing. The figures are not to scale and it is a short visit and not that interesting. It is really not worth the money. The wax figures are not that well made either. I honestly would not recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AbirViews
40,Fun but a little expensive,"It was fun to go through the museum though it's a little expensive for how long it takes to walk through. Some of the wax figures are really excellent, some are just OK, and others are unrecognizable. If it had been priced five to $10 less I would say it was great but for 20 bucks I really can't",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevefromExeter
40,Decent attraction considering location,"In all honesty there isn't much left to love about Hollywood Blvd. I'm not into celebrities at all, however the wax museum was interesting. Some didn't look like who they claim to be but many were eerily realistic. The friendliness of the staff is the main reason I gave 4 stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/percellas

40,Better Than the Average Wax Museum,"During a business conference, the museum was booked for our private use. I was pleasantly surprised that the wax figures could be touched and I got some great pictures with lifelike celebrities. The figures were much better quality than the ones I had seen previously. It was lots of fun trying to guess the celebrities and the movies/songs associated with them. The back drops were very good as well.Much better that i thought it would be!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GuiWong
40,Worth a quick visit,The museum needs some additional attractions for tweens and teens. There are a lot of good wax figures for adults.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TotallyMadeUpHandle
40,Vacation,"This was a lot of fun . The children have only seen wax museums in scary movies so this was fun and a treat for them and us. Took lots of pictures with all the stars and caricaturesFun day out, plan on a hour, maybe a little more. It was not overly priced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PERRYMERLIN
30,Much smaller than Madame Tussaud's,"We were pretty excited about this wax museum, but when we saw it, it was a pretty small place, much smaller than the very famous Madame Tussaud's...The wax figures were made quite realistically and we enjoyed posing for photos with all the celebs, shaking hands with Barack Obama and putting on a pirate hat to sail the seven seas! We liked how they had props nearby - like a guitar - so we could really step into that famous figure's shoes. But we wished there were more famous figures in the museum. Next time will go to Madame Tussaud's instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Homelover69
50,Nice alternative to Madame Tussaud's,I had accidentally purchased the tickets for this attraction. Note there are two wax museums on Hollywood Blvd (Hollywood wax museum and Madame Tussaud's). Both offer different flavors.Coming back to Hollywood wax museum I loved it. It is build on themes unlike Madame Tussaud's. I liked their horror collection a bit scary. As we went madam Tussaud's we did not take much photos.I liked other themes also.I brought the package and went to believe it or not and Guinness world records. Over the package is good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TadA232
30,Expected more,I think our expectations were very high or they could have done a better job ! Nothing special about the place ! I probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/king_reception

50,The best!,"We had so much fun here! We hadn't planned on visiting, but we were walking the Walk of Fame and came upon it. It was early in the day and we were the only people in here! This is a large museum so it takes 20-30 minutes to get through. Longer if you are taking all sorts of crazy pictures like we did! There is a part of the museum that is devoted to horror movies- I couldn't go through that part- I tried-too scary! My daughter did, but she said it was very creepy. They change the wax figures every so often. It was relaxing, and it made us laugh. It is worth a visit. The price is 16.99 pp. They will try to sell you a package that includes the Believe it or not museum and something else, but we were only interested in the wax museum. You have to ask for the price for just the wax museum, otherwise they will sell you a 40 ticket pp.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ASLOV
30,OK visit,"We probably expected a little bit more than what we seen, though was still a cool place to walk through. Probably needs a bit of a clean due to all the people touching the characters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebeccarH9114OH
20,Very disappointing...,"Very short tour, and the figures don't resemble the characters very well. A lot of people (including us) were asking who some of them were.Definitely not worth the time and money for us. Very disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/InnerVortex61
40,So much fun!,"I have never been to a wax museum before so I can't compare it to others, but I loved this one! Some of the statues didn't look exactly like who they were meant to be, but we still had so much fun taking photos with them. The museum has 'prop stations' set up that you can use for the photos - eg a fedora and leather jacket next to the Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones statue, a box of chocolates next to Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump. There is also a horror section that we were both entertained and terrified by! I do wish the museum was a little bigger, but we definitely had a good time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmilySparrow
30,Not too bad but don't get too excited,Found this place to be pretty average.My son enjoyed dressing up with the props and taking photos even though he didn't know who most of the people were.A reasonably average place which is a bit run down and tired.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kosta100
10,Terrible don't waste your money,"After being to quite a few of the Madame Tussaud's museums we thought this would be similar. The wax figures were terrible quality , maybe one of them actually looked like a famous person. Really disappointed I don't normally do reviews but want to warn people not to waste their money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jesskaar
40,Fun for kids of any age!( including the grown up ones),We bought a triple ticket ( including Ripleys believe it or not and Guinness book of records )but the wax works was the most fun.... There were props along the way for photo posing with your favourite characters which made it interactive and fun... Sme of the characters weren't quite recognisable until you saw the name on them then y could see the likeness.... But lots of fun and laughs had by everyone from all ages in our group.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wendyscott13
10,Most stars don't like what you see on the TV or in the magazines. It was very dissapointing.,"Most stars don't like what you see on the TV or in the magazines. It was very dissapointing. If you will decide to go, don't have big expectations. May be just for laughs. You need to read most of the signs to get an idea of who is portrayed. Waste of money",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MayaR_13
30,Fun!,The only reason why I rated the Hollywood wax museum average is because some of the wax figures of famous people don't quite look like the famous people My husband and a couple of our friends went to visit the wax museum it's fun! To do if your around the neighborhood and also If your looking to see if Paul walkers wax figure is Inside I'm sorry to disappoint you but it's not :(,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cvh3
40,A Lot of Fun,My brother and I had a lot of fun taking pictures with the figures while wearing props. It was well worth going through. A few of the figures didn't look like who they were supposed to be but most did. Scarlett Johansson was hard to tell who it was. The lighting for pictures wasn't that great either. So take multiples. Other than that it was awesome.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rach340
50,Enjoy yourself and have fun,"Take your time and have photo's with all the wax stars, use all the props that are next to them. We spent a lot of time with the stars. ENJOY !!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Raesholiday
30,Short visit.,There are not to much artist. I expected more than 30 or 40. There were less than 30.Most of the actors or sigers have their own scenary. That was good because you can take good picutures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anamariab455
40,It's fun,I thought it was nice to take pictures with your favourite stars but some of the pictures were a bit dark because the lighting wasn't that good beside all the stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sally155017
30,Only like 25 stars,"I was expecting a whole lot of stars but they only had like 25. Each star had a ""room"" decorated in one of their movies with them in the middle available for photos. They had props you could put on and pose with the wax figures - my kids loved that. But the exhibit itself felt like it was lacking something. You could go through the whole museum in 20 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/15LisaT
30,Not bad,"This was interesting, I've never been to a wax museum, so we had fun. Some of the figures were in the wrong place so the signage was off or missing. We bought the 3 museum pass for one price so it was worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahC2348JE
30,Skip this attraction unless you really want to take photos with wax stars,"While some of the wax statues resemble the real individual/s, some of it is just off. It's a good distraction if you run out of things to do in Hollywood, but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this attraction because it's not really worth the time / money. One thing I found entertaining was that you could dress up in clothes and accessories and take photos with the wax figures (For instance, there is a hat and a glove near MJ's statue and you can wear them and take photos with the wax figure). Also, compared to the Guinness World Records Museum and the Ripley's Believe It or Not in Hollywood, this place is much better actually. If you must go, go late in the evening (it's open till 10 p.m. or so) or first thing during a weekday morning to avoid crowds. That way, you could at least get some crowd-free photos with your favorite wax stars!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lakjay333
30,Had lost of fun,"Visited with my Sister and had a great time, some wax figures are incredibly on point others not so much, but you have the chance to take pictures using props and that was fun for us. We bought the triple tickets that give you entrance to Guiness and Ripleys but the other 2 attractions I did not like much i liked better the wax museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lully7710
40,"Some figures were spot on, others not so much.","So, I have been to the Madame Tussaud's in NYC and L.A.. I have been to the Hollywood Wax Museum in Branson and L.A. now. I loved the variety of characters here especially freaked out when I saw Marilyn Monroe and Lucille Ball in the same room!! However, Marilyn did not look even close to the real deal. Lucy was spot on. I loved the Ninja Turtles-brought me back to my childhood days. A major highlight for me was the P!nk wax figure on the way out. P!nk is my FAVORITE singer so imagine my surprise when we were almost done and saw her! This is a small place and you can get through it within an hour or so. The one in Branson had a much better collection of things to purchase and the figures seemed to be a better quality in Branson but this was an enjoyable experience nonetheless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BubbaSmiley
30,Not bad,"We’ve bought the VIP Tour – 3 Museums (Wax, Rippley’s and Guiness). Nice places to visit with kids or when it rains. It took 3 hours to visit the 3 museums. They are pretty close to each other. Interesting but there is more stuff to do i Hollywood.Tussault has better quality.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JerryL549
30,Ok but Passable!,"My friend and I bought a package deal for the Hollywood Wax Museum, Ripley’s believe It or Not and Guinness Book for World Records.All three of which are located on Holly Wood Boulevard right next to each other. While it was a fun way to kill time it was certainly not the most interesting of everything else available to do in LA.It is almost a tourist trap as it is located centrally on Hollywood Boulevard and could easily be sold to you as you are walking by viewing other famous landmarks.Families with kids might enjoy it more as it is a bit interactive and gives you lots of fun photos with celebrities, interesting findings and world records all around the world.I have been to Madame Tussads before and personally feel that the wax figures in MT are more realistic and way better than the ones in the HWM. All 3 places took us about 2 hours to cover. Overall though, if given an opportunity we would have passed this option and done another studio tour or theme park instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rbwanders420
20,Did not meet my expectations,"I don't have any other wax museum experiences to contrast my review but this was not what I expected to see. It was an experience and now I can say that I've been there and done that. Pro-Tip: Purchase the 3 attraction pass and you'll get entry into the Hollywood Wax Museum, the Ripley's Believe it or Not Museum and the Genus Book of World Records Museum and have 3 days to use your passes. The standard price for one person to visit one attraction is $16 and the 3 attraction pass costs $32 so it's basically buy 2 get 1 free.I unfortunately didn't have the time to visit all three attractions so we chose the one we were standing in front of which was the Hollywood wax museum. The first thing that I noticed was that the celebrities did look like themselves but then again they didn't. It's like they put detail in them but just enough. I really think that they could step it up a bit and really make the figures look more like the people. Some of the figures were just standing around and other figures were the celebs dressed in some of their memorable acting roles. I would much rather have just seen the celebs in their natural looking form. They have a horror movie exhibit and it is pretty cool and the new zombie feature is awesome even though it has nothing to do with wax whatsoever. The space could be used better throughout the museum as well. Some figures have an entire room to themselves while other figures are stacked on top of each other. They have a TV that was showing how the figures are made but it was very hard to hear due to the other noise that is present in the museum so we didn't really take in the show. I don't know if it reveals whether or not they figures match the height and body type of the actual humans but some of the figures seemed really off. Vin Diesel was too skinny and so was Ben Affleck. Jennifer Aniston barely looked like Jennifer Aniston and there were two figures that I couldn't even recognize. Eminem should have been easy to recognize but my daughter had to tell me who he was. They have a figure of Dictator Obama posed so that you can snap a photo of you shaking hands with him but I hate that they even have him there at all. Call it personal preference but I can't stand to see that guy's face anywhere. Overall, the figures could be better detailed. I'd like to see them as they are not how they looked in some movie and a better thought out layout would be nice too.Oh well, at least I've had the experience and I'll have to do it at least once more when I take my wife and other children to Hollywood next June.If you haven't been, I would suggest going just so you can say you've been. I will definitely check out the competition next year too.Thanks for readin.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrbraae
30,Just OK,"Not as good at Madame Tussauds, but you get a good deal on the ticket if you buy for Guiness and Ripley's at the same time. It's still fun, but I probably wouldn't go here it if wasn't included in the other ticket (but I'm not the biggest fan of wax museums).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justinehresman
30,Wax museum was ok,visited the wax museumfound that the wax models rarely looked like the celebrity they were intended to bestaff were not friendly or presentprops were provided for some photosoverall wasn't the best I've seen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/holliee659
30,Fun !,We bought a ticket bundle for this and two other attractions and went for the fun of it. It's not quite Madame Tussauds but it was fun. Hollywood Wax Museum is certainly a cheaper choice for Madame Tussauds. Loved the horror section !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tuyazh
40,Good,We visited the wax museum on Hollywood boulevard and thoroughly enjoyed it . We saw some new wax statues that we had not seen in other wax museums The horror section of the museum was much more than I expected .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1STEP4WARD
40,Museum,Had a blast posing with all the wax figures would definitely come again. Liked everything even the Hispanic celebrities.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/592annar
50,some look like they can come out and act now.,see the stars of today and yesteryear made to look very lifelike at this nice museum on the Blvd. there is a price to go in but it is a nice place to visit and see the stars as they looked when in the movies. Most of them have stars on Hollywood Blvd. A nice visit for you to go and enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barryn680
40,A selfie stick owner's spot,Some of the reviews we read were a bit up and down but we decided to go see for ourselves. We realised again that one has to see for yourself and its also with what attitude you do it that matters. My wife and I had a good few laughs taking selfies with the characters on display. Some of them are positioned in such a way that creates the opportunity for some fun pics.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andreolivier
50,"Great day out, reccomended","This was heaps of fun! definitely one of our highlights from our trip. we took so many photos and all the staff were really friendly. the figures are very cool, some amazingly lifelike others not so much but I loved the fact you could pose nest to them for photos making it a more interactive environment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/430juliat
40,I enjoyed it,I went with my sister and she said the other one down the street was better but I noticed the price was much more expensive so we ended up at this one. I thought it was nice. Some of the wax statues were spot on and others not so much. It gives you an idea of how short Tom Cruise really is. I posted a pic of me with Morgan freeman on FB and my friends thought I met him for real! There's a horror section that was cool too. Gotta love chucky! Haha,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Missjaxn_2000
30,Not the best Wax Museum,"I would not have gone to the Hollywood Wax Museum but since we had bought a package for 30 dollars each for 3 attractions, we went. It was a decent time but considering we had just visited another wax museum just right up the street it wasn’t that great. The other place has much better, astonishing, real-life wax figures and this place doesn’t come close. Only a very few actually looked ok but it just doesn’t measure up to the other place. If you have your mind set on going to a wax museum research the 2 wax museums in the area and choose wisely. The horror movie set was actually pretty interesting though and I'll give them that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3743BSdaniela
50,Much better than expected!,"I expected cheezy, but was pleasantly surprised. Family LOVED it, and it was much more fun than I expected. Worth the cost, even if just to momentarily escape the Hollywood BLVD crazy for a little while :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spdesertcoast
30,Madame Tussauds on a budget,"Great to visit if you're on a budget (We got the 3 VIP Attraction pass for $25 which included Ripley's Believe it or Not and Guinness World Records).Some of the figures were a bit unlike the actual stars but you get what you pay for, the horror section of the Hollywood Wax Museum was really great! If you go there for anything let it be the horror section!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dylannelson94
30,"Some lifelike was figures, but small attraction","This attraction was rated a 3 because it was quite small, and I would have liked to see them preparing the wax figures. They only have an audio of Beyonce describing the making of her wax model, which actually ends up being a commercial for Beyonce. Some of the figures are life like, but several were a bit difficult to recognize. Even with our discount from the airlines, this is a pricey experience, but if you want to see wax figures, it is okay. At the end of visit before stepping out of the building, there was a woman pouring wax over your hand, for a hefty price, that would make a colored wax of hand to take home. It was an okay visit for my teen, but I do not think it was anywhere near the favorite of Santa Monica and LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/domp103
50,I really enjoyed the wax characters,"I highly recommend going to the wax museum when you’re in LA. The stars looked very real, and the scenes changed throughout the museum. It was fun and worth every penny.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/741sandyk
50,Fun Times,Kids and adults will love this museum. The wax figures were so life like. We got several photos with figures and people thought we really seen that person.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GIGI62015
40,Very cool. Pricey though.,This place was awesome! The wax figures looked so real it was crazy! Our family definitely enjoyed this place and got many laughs out of it. However it is very pricey. For a family of five it cost about $70 or so.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shaylielynn
20,Time waster.,"I'm not that into movies or actors. Therefore I wasn't excited by this experience. 1- I know they are all fake. 2- I don't care about these things. 3- they do a terrible job on the hands. Now for the positive... 1- I wasn't in the heat or sun. 2- a few looked real, Taylor Swift, Morgan Freeman, and another guy I can't remember actually did look real. 3- I didn't have to take a long time here bc besides looking, there isn't anything to do. Half an hour is plenty of time. But if you are a creative type it would be fun to try to interact with each one. That would be fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgiaMichaelTaylor
20,Rip off...,I expected more. It was just a quick walk through with no bells and whistles. However I did pay an arm and a leg which I feel is a rip off.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1APPLE2PEANUTS

30,I expected more...,It's cheaper to purchase your ticket online and don't expect to be there for more than 20 minutes tops! I really expected more from this place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rashaanc

10,What a disgrace,I was so disappointed when I took a friend to see the Museum. Half the Wax models didn't even look like the people they were portraying. It was an embarrassment especially seeing we were in the heart of Hollywood. Definitely not worth the money.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/481nigelf
40,Interesting but not a must visit,Interesting wax figures but come only if you have a good bundle visitor price. Feel free to skip if you are running out of time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mjl3w
30,Just another tourist attractions,"Just another 49 dollars wasted. I hit my forehead and said, ""I could have had a V8"". Go ahead and buy yourself the V8 first, then go in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonesc343
20,Who Is It?,"Easily located right on Hollywood Boulevard. This place is right in the middle of where all the action is. Ashamed nothing was happening in this place. The price is less than $20.00, and should be. I was dissatisfied with this place. These look-a-likes were not as good as I hoped. I don't know who the wax woman was named Beyoncé, but that isn't the Beyoncé we all know. This experience gets a thumbs down. Expectations were set too high.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swardrn

Sorry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hubz72
10,Hilarious but for the wrong reasons,"I actually visited this in January 2014. It wasn't the best waxworks, in fact it was pretty terrible but that actually made it more fun ie playing guess the celebrity. The reason I've scored it so low wasn't to do with the museum, it was to do with my experience attempting to purchase something from the gift shop. There was a non English speaking family in front me, the 'lady' at the desk refused to serve them and turned her back to them to continue talking to a colleague. Her colleague told her to serve them so she turned to them, told them she didn't understand what they were saying (it was in broken English and they were asking to pay for a key ring, it wasn't rocket science) and continued to ignore them. They left. I stood and waited for her to finish talking, she didn't. I was buying a few items but she wasn't bothered. I decided to leave them on the desk and leave, at that moment she proceeded to SCREAM at me as I was walking away. I've never been spoken to in this way, she was screaming and called me rude, I decided to explain why I was leaving to which she responded with by cursing at me. Another colleague followed me out of the museum to tell me that this awful woman is called Julia and suggested I make a formal complaint. I did so the next day but nothing was ever done about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tallulahfallulah
20,Almost but no cigar,"im thinking that they had really bad photos to work from! The idea was there but Cluney, Ford, Affleck, well everybody concerned should be grateful that they all look too thin and too young! And Peirce Brosnan...well it's a laugh! I did have my photo taken on the prow of the Titanic with a handsome young man ( the setting gives this one away as the likeness wasn't great!). However, having said that, it passed half an hour between drinks and the horror side was a bit creepy,..especially as my husband upped and left me to hide around a corner! The hoot opportunity of stealing Forrest Gumps chocolates was too good to pass up!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/769lesleyw
50,Fun,I love this wax museum lots of great photo opertunities lots to see very unique and one of a kind lots of rear wax figures too,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luna6373
10,Lisa P.,Definitely not worth the money! Some wax figures were not a good likeness at all! Too much money for the length of the exhibit and quality of work.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lisainthewinter
50,Loved this Place! Used My Discount Pass to Get Half Off!,"This place was out of a dream land. It was like standing in the middle of every celebrity Id ever seen on TV. Everywhere I looked there was someone else famous! If you wondering if they look real or not the answer if YES! Wow, even when your right up close they look so real like you can reach out and touch the real person.Of course I searched for the best discount before going to the wax museum and ended up saving 50% off admission for me and my wife. First I checked the Local Los Angeles CitySavver.com website like I always do for local discounts but they were all out of vouchers when I checked.So my next step to check Goldstar but they only had certain days you could go and the weekends were not included. Finally I found a Local Discount Pass from a site called MyCheapPass lol and ended up saving 50% off my admissions. I did pay more for the pass than I saved at the attraction but It comes with 56 other LA attractions for half off and its good all year so I don't think I can go wrong here. So YES I would recommend the Hollywood Wax Museum to anyone thinking about going especially with the right coupon or promo code as always!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/172codyh
30,"Maybe 3.5 stars, best of the three in VIP pack",We got the VIP package which included Ripley's and Guinness' and my daughter and I thought this was the best of the three. It is however quite small and probably takes less than an hour. I enjoyed it more than Madame Tussaud's Hollywood although MT is much larger. The difference between MT and HW is that MT has the models out in the open where it's easier to take pictures but was little sterile. However HW is more scenes that you are looking into which makes it harder to take pictures but to me a little more enjoyable. Not great and not a great value but we did enjoy ourselves.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_MTJ_99
30,For for pictures,"If you don't happen to run in a real life celebrity in LA, visit the wax museum to take selfies and have fun with your friends or family. It took us about 45 minutes to go through the entire museum taking pictures at nearly every display. At $16 each, it was worth it for the laughs and the pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dixierob
20,Overpriced and Low Quality,"This place is way too overpriced for what it is. It cost $16 to get in and the whole museum could easily be explored in 10 min or less. While some are rather good, most of the sculptures don't even look that accurate. You can, however, get as close as you want to most of them. Still, you're better off paying $10-$15 extra and go to Madame Tussauds down the street. At least you know the wax figures will be much better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brianclemens94
50,A little better than Madame T,"So many awesome settings and wax models... the Pirates of the Carrabean... even Steve Irwin from Australia... my wife got into bed with Hef! We bought the 3 museum pass from Ripleys and did Ripleys, Guiness Book of Records and the Wax Museum.... all museums easy accessible in a wheelchair.. we highly recommend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/181AndrewH
50,My son's 10th birthday,I bought the VIP pass the 3 museums I thought it was a deal but honestly depending on the time you have to go to the museums it May be better to make better use of your time and just to go to 2 of The museums and thoroughly enjoy them in the wax at least for a 10-year-old crowd,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meicl
40,It's a wax museum?,This is right next door to Madame Tussaud well just about. It is different to Madame Tussaud. We did both and enjoy both as there were sit up different. Kids would enjoy this as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/771323
30,Who ??,Some of the figures was hard to reconised. Only few very good ones. Easy take pictures and pose with models. A bit dissapointment with quite expensive ticket.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DosLeones
30,Do not confuse it with Tussaud,"If you want to see madame Tussaud's, then look around. Perhaps the Wax Museum is misleading you. Tussaud is 150-200 feet away. The exhibits sometimes look like their origins, but usually they're a bit taller. Nonetheless I took lots of pictures. I sometimes asked my brother and sisters whose appearance was in front. Though, of course their names are there. Leaving the museum, you are suggested being photoed at the Hollywood sign which also costs you some $$.But you can hug Madonna or lie with Hugh Hefner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kamop2014
50,Magnificent!!!!,The place is so fascinating. The people in wax looks so real is unbelievable. Visited here in 1980. One of the best places I have visited. Would love to visit again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dskeens
40,Good value with VIP pass!,If you've never been to a wax museum then this is a must see! Super cool and for the most part very real-life looking. A few weren't as accurate looking as some of the others. It made us wonder if there are different artists? Also included in the pass were Ripley's Believe It or Not and Guinness World Records - We thought it well worth the money and very interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SherraLin
30,Had fun - but disappointed.,"I haven't been to this wax museum for a couple years, but the last time I was here it looked much bigger inside. The wax figures were a bit disappointing in some aspects (Elvis, John Wayne, Charlies Angels) looked quite bad in appearance.Also, for the $$ I spent here we didn't expect to tour the entire museum in about 15 minutes!! I also remember the horror section being much bigger and more exciting to walk through in times past.I give it 3 stars out of 5 because it's time for a bit of an upgrade to keep it popular to visit. I miss the old Wax Museum that use to be in Buena Park! That Museum had hundreds of wax figures that looked real AND you spent about 2 hours seeing everything. Hollywood Wax Museum should take some notes & improve on this concept.Overall, just okay visit. Make some changes and we may be back in the future. Give us that HOLLYWOOD grandeur visitors are expecting when they visit your museum.Thank you kindly for reading my review - McClintock853",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mcclintock853
30,Good value for money if combined in VIP pass,"I wouldn't pay for admission on its own, I would only combine with the two others (ripely believe it or not and Guinness world records) as it makes a good time filler and is a bit of fun. Some wax figures are dated and aren't as accurate as others. Would be interesting to compare it to the madam tussauds wax museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shan_and_Kirsty
50,Bring your camera,"We LOVED the wax museum. It was quite expensive to enter, (I guess they have to pay for the wax somehow), but it was super fun.We did the full tourist thing & took pics with nearly every wax person. My ultimate fave was Forest Gump. His was a whole scene & was amazing!!!Hugh Heffner's was brilliant too.A great day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Holidaygal25
30,Not Madame Tussauds,"Do not get this placed confused with Madame Tussauds Hollywood Wax Museum there are on the same street and only 0.2 miles a part! The only wax figures that look close to the actual celebrity or character were the TNMT, Samuel L. Jackson and Morgan Freeman! Beyonce, Madonna and others looked awful but for my 3yr old he had a ball so I guess that was all worth the trip! I purchased the Hollywood VIP Pass for $29.99. I would suggest paying more and going to Madame Tussauds if you are looking for wax figures that resemble the actual person.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LashawndaC
40,Horror Corridor was the highlight,"absolutely loved the Horror corridor with everyone from Pinhead to Hellboy, Scream and a predator all represented. The rest of the museum was also good though is probably finding it hard to compete against the more well known Madamae Tussaud's. Well worth visiting, especially if you are a horror fan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/525shanec
20,Don't waste your money,"Old, tired, creepy. Not anything to write home about. Most of the figures look almost like the real thing, if you figure that you are drunk looking at them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pitufo00
30,Okay,"I loved the Horror corridor with wax figures from different horror and sci fi movies, but many of the wax figures in general did no look like the actual actors being portrayed; especially Beyonce (very sad work). Otherwise, it was fun with a great low price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yahtsy
30,ok,this place is ok nothing compared to madame tussauds further down the street tho good if on a strict budget tho x,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mamahoglet
40,"Slightly inferior compared to Madame Toussauds, but still enjoyable","There are lots of wax figures you can pose with, and make sure you bring your camera. It's not as crowded compared to Madame Toussauds, but nonetheless there is a lot of fun to be had. There is a large variety of figures so nobody will be disappointed. Make sure when you buy your tickets include the visit to Ripley's Believe it or Not and Guinness World of Records to save costs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chris_sharry
30,to see and be next to world famous,"Never buy entry for a single museum along Hollywood blvd, like the wax one because its paying very much for tiny place witch have nothing to do in comparison with Madame Tussaud in London or the equivalent in Paris. Buy the package including Ripley's Believe it or Not! and Guiness world of Record and you could spend anfunny afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeanPierreB722
50,Fun afternoon,This is a great place to visit. The characters are very lifelike and we took lots of photos. Some of the wax figures weren't recognised by the kids but they still had a great time. My favourites were Forrest Gump and Lady Gaga. If you walk down Hollywood Blvd there are people handing out $10 per person discount vouchers which makes it heaps cheaper for a family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missdoo01
50,A fun time for the entire family,"I had never visited a wax museum before, and didn't think much of them until my kid expressed a desire to visit the Hollywood Wax Museum during our last visit to L.A.It was more interesting than I could have ever imagined! Stars from the past and the future, some that look so perfect it could pass as a real person, others not so much, but still fun to look at and play around. The sets are pretty cool, and sometimes you can sit next to a character and be a part of the scene for a great photo.I recommend this to anyone looking for something to do on a weekday evening in Hollywood, especially with kids.By the way, I suggest you buy the tickets that include the other two museums, Ripleys' and Guinness, both also very entertaining and nearby one another.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAhiker09
30,"Family Visits First Wax Museum Visit, Cost $17 Per Person, Children Free","Let me first start off by saying go to Starbucks after your trip to the Museum because they will want you to throw out your Vente' Pike Place Roast before entering the museum.Also, very disappointed in the employee who sold us our Hollywood Commemorative Picture. The website says we get a free digital copy when we buy the commemorative photo but was never offered. Emailed someone from the website and 5 days later, still no response. Very poor service.If you enjoy taking pictures, #selfies and posing then this is the ideal place to visit. During our visit to the wax museum we took 150 pictures on our cell phone. It is very easy to do. We really took our time and took a lot of pictures. At times we had to let people pass us up because we were taking too long posing. If you only look and read the the information cards at the museum then it can be finished very quickly (15 minutes) but if you want pictures for Christmas Cards or to show your friends when you get home then it can take about an hour and a half. My family of four all went and took pictures with just about every celebrity in the museum.Cost: My wife and I and our 16 year old all paid $17 dollars. Our 4 year old was free. I didn't know that we were going to visit the wax museum that day so I didn't buy tickets online. We would have saved a dollar doing so.Next Year: On my next visit I plan on visiting Madame Tussauds but will buy tickets online and save about 6 dollars per ticket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamesK912
30,This was fun!,"I visited the Hollywood wax museum, in hopes it would be as great as the Las Vegas wax museum. Honestly- it doesn't have as many celebrities as Vegas, but I had a great time. I was all by myself but still managed to take some great shots (with myself in the picture). I think my mindset made y visit as great as it was. *Note- it is small",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsGway2
40,3 for 1,"If you buy a certain ticket to this Wax museum, it will include admission into Ripleys and Guinness Book also but ask first.Perfect escape off the boulevard for kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WelcomeMat
30,It is average,It is average and I believe you can skip. The quality of the wax status are not very high. Madam Tussaud wax museum is much better to visit with larger collection and higher quality.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/osamayoussef
20,Listen to the reviews!,I had read the reviews before we went but decided to give it a try anyway. This was okay but so not worth the money. Head down the street and do Madame Tousad's instead. This was very small and the quality of the statues was lacking. We still had a good time but would not recommend this to others.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leecabug
10,"Waste of money, too expensive",Cost us 18.00 US each and it took 15 mins to get through the wax figures. Some of the wax figures don't even look like the orginals. A joke really. If I was the actor/actress/singer and saw my wax figure as poorly made as some of them I would be telling them to remove it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebbieV892
40,Great Stop,We purchased tickets for the 3 museums on Hollywood BLVD. Glad we did it. We all enjoyed the wax celebrities. Some were done and others failed.... Would we go back? No. Once is enough.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elladah
40,Stars in wax,"We bought a 3 in 1 ticket, taking us to Hollywood Wax Museum, Ripleys Believe it or not and finally Guiness World Records. Could take close up shots with Hollywood stars. Got to see the dancing of Beyonce. My favourite wax figure is that of Iron Man.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GanL
30,Save your $$$,"Save your money and go to Madam Tussauds which is just up the road, you can buy a pass which gets you in to Ripleys Believe it or not, and Guiness World Records, which at least made it cheaper.The waxworks weren't very good unfortunately.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stefnag
30,Had fun but slightly overpriced,"This was the first wax museum I've gone to and thought it was pretty cool. It was a fun place to take photos, but for the price it didn't really meet my expectations. It only took about half an hour to see everything and for the price I expected it to be bigger.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/317chelseac
30,No Bang For Your Buck,"Not only does this place have some of the most disturbing wax statues,it is also a bit overpriced.Your better off going to Ripley's or Madame T's.It is ridiculously small and quite frankly feels a little run down.Save your money and grab a $5 souvenir across the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ginoh368
30,Not really worth the money.,"We chose this wax museum over the other because it was cheaper. For $15 you get about 30 min of simple entertainment. They seriously need to add more statues and some newer entertainers would be nice. If I had to do it over, I'd spend the money and go to the other wax museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/6millersalaska
30,A stroll though Hollywoods elites,"I had to admire the effort and time they took to set this place up. Good thing about buying tickets is you can get a 3 pass to Guinness world records, believe it or not, and wax museum all for one low price, these attractions do not take long to compleat soo don't expect to make a full day of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Salaamus
50,wax museum,Thouroughly enjoyed the trip through this museum. The statues inside are close and personal allowing you to get photos with the stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lonniel645
20,Don't bother,"We got a 3 for 1 deal that included this place, plus Ripleys believe it or not & Guiness book of records.I'm guessing the Hollywood Wax Museum is the cheap knock off to Madame Tuassards, which is just a few doors down, near the Chinese theatre.This wax museum is boring, old, outdated in information & 99% of the wax figures look nothing like who their sposed to be. I definitely would not recommend this to anyone else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheGirlsNextDoorAust
30,Good place to get off the humid streets,We were walking down Hollywood Blvd and came to stumble upon this attraction. It's a bit pricey but okay overall. The wax figures looked interesting and real from afar but could use some room for improvement. The walkway can get cramped if two big groups of people come in at the same time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/liveitmarg
20,Don't bother!,"The only reason we paid a visit here was because it was raining and we needed an indoor activity. We bought a pass that included a few attractions, the wax museum being one of them. It is a shame because the place has such potential…plenty to see and a great way to interact but I was incredibly disappointed with the figures themselves. Some barely resembled the actors and the quality of the wax was awful! Save your pennies unless you are desperate to fill in some time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshH1611
50,Better then Madam Tussauds,"Far more interesting then madam Tussauds , yes the wax figures may be a little less realistic but the lay out and how they are set upAre far better , we'll worth a visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amygrimm88
30,"Good ideas, but poor execution","We loved the venue for containing heaps of wax figures of Hollywood greats, set in scenes from the movies they starred in. This was a nice touch, and meant that there was plenty to see. However the quality of the wax sculptures was terrible - the skin colors were really yellow and clear, like they couldn't be bothered painting them as they are Caucasians, and most did not look like the actor at all - we spent a lot of time reading the name plaques just to work out who they were supposed to be. Its worth a look, as its done out really well as a venue, but if you want to see realistic wax figures then walk down the street to Madame Tousauds instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wattostudios
20,Nothing compared to NY. Needs updating,"While I feel the New York Wax museum needs updating (or I need to stop taking out of town visitors there) the Los Angeles location is beat.The wax looked like it is pealing off the characters faces and the scenes are nothing special. It smells like dead people, its over priced, and you get attacked by people dressed up as sandwiches standing in line.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaniellaM1
20,Disapointing,"This museum is not worth a visit. The exhibition is simple and neither interesting nor amazing. There are more interesting things to see in the area, do not waste your time here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Enurst
50,Fun at the Hollywood Wax Museum,Walking into the wax museum is both fun and eerie. I wasn't quite sure if some of the figures were real or not. A bit of old Hollywood and a really fun mother and daughter outing. I highly recommend it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/307gailh
50,Figures so real it's unreal!,"The Hollywood Wax Museum is not to be missed! This is easily one of my absolute favorite attractions on the boulevard, and it isn't difficult to see why! This museum is the longest running wax museum in the entire country. So you had better believe that this is the real deal!These figures are almost unreal. Offering the opportunities to pose with icons like Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, and Charlie Chaplin, this museum offers photo experiences like no other. And let's face it, ladies, the unfortunate fact is that this is probably as close as we will ever get to Johnny Depp, so let's take advantage of it!Located just across the street from the Guinness World Records Museum, visit both and have a night to remember!Visit them online for additional information, or call 323-462-5991.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DestinationDiaries
40,Not just for families - good time with friends!,"I haven't been to any wax museums before and always thought they were for family fun but I went with a group of girlfriends on a Saturday afternoon and we had a blast! There are so many things to do in Hollywood and as residents, we take it all for granted. But this was a fun, silly, good time with girlfriends and our cameras. I have a ton of fun photos and great memories! I saw plenty of couples and singles in there. I don't think this has to be reserved for the kids and parents. And I love that it's open late -- what the hell. Have some cocktails, dinner and go check it out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJF111
40,Family Fun In Hollywood!,"This museum is great to visit if you have family visiting from out of town and they want to spend the day in Hollywood. It's a fun way to spend the day. It's full of amazing, life-sized re-creations of movie stars and other characters. You will see some of your favorite movie stars and get to take some great photos. When your a tourist pictures are key and this place will allow you to get some great photo ops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/680vanessad
40,Pretty neat! They're not exact on the models though,"It is something pretty awesome and if your creative, you can have fun taking some funny pictures. A little bummed that a lot of the statues don't really look alike, but you'll have some fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/592melissar
50,Fun (& scary) sights,"This museum was full of amazing, life-sized re-creations of movie stars and other characters. Although some were true to form, quite a few were difficult to recognize (i.e. Beyonce, Hugh Jackman, etc.). The museum was MUCH more spacious than it appeared from the outside but VERY dark. Don't forget to turn on your camera's flash when taking pictures inside. Also, this is a MUCH more affordable alternative to Madame Tussaud's museum",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Angell24
20,Not worth the visit,"I visited the museum this weekend and it was cheap admission and now I know why. Very small location and the wax figures are awful looking. If you have ever been to Madam Tussads then you know what awesome wax figures look like. Not to mention its in an awful location, bums all over the street and totally over crowded. This place was so bad, not worth the money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TFab326
30,Cheesy but fun,"Well, we had to try it- why not? It was fun to see stars recreated in wax though some were nothing close to their namesakes in appearance. Despite that, it was wacky to pose with waxy stars and pretend to be in a scene- our teenager got a kick out of it. They probably need to do some updating for stars ""makeup"" and scene selections.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Merebarx
20,Don't waste your time or your money,"The only reason to go to this wax museum is for the irony that all of the statues don't look like the actors or celebrities they are supposed to portray, its even had articles written about it focusing on just how terrible it is. If you are a big fan of wax museums go to Madame Tussauds at the other end of Hollywood Blvd next to Grauman's Theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Roaming_Raven
20,Not worth $17,"The wax museum was tiny compared to what I was expecting. Went with a couple of teenagers and at the time we didn't think of doing the pass for 3 places for $33 but now we regret just buying the $17 dollar one entry. Some of the wax figures looked like the stars but others were nowhere near as close. Also noticed that some of the figures were missing because the label was still there. In one exhibit that had a gate saw a cell phone charging so it had to be one of the employees there, would expect a work place like that to be a little more professional and charge the phone in the break room not the exhibit. Just definitely not worth the 17 by itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roxanneh329
30,Group with ripleys and guiness book or record tour or dont bother,"It's a small museum with popular figures which for the most part look like who they are supposed to be, grouping with the other two we were able to go through them in 2 hours, not much point going to kust 1 for $17 when you can do all 3 for $33. If you want just wax figures go to madam tousands down the road when its not busy. On another note they were all airconditioned and had useable facilites with no hard sell",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlenE171
40,Very fun,Cheaper than Madame Tussauds but also smaller..still a lot of fun! They have a little scary hallway that actually made my friend jump a couple of times.Enjoyed taking pictures with the sculptures and I hope to come back some day in the future,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MerryGee88
10,Not worth the entry fee of $17.,"After being At madam Tussauds we thought we would try this wax museum, but were severely disappointed. The tour that was there only lasted ten minutes top.Save your money And go elsewhere.Most of the models do not look like who they are meant to be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShetlandExplorer
50,Get your picture with a celebrity,"The wax museum is a great attraction that will give you the chance to see and take pictures with renowned movie and TV actors.Most of the wax sculptures are very life-like and you will find yourself trying to remember names and movies they had worked on before even read the plaques.The hall of horror was very good and scary full with moans, laments and scary noises that accompanied the sculptures of horror movie characters.I think it was very well worth the price of admission. I didn't pay for the three museum deal; I only went to the wax museum.The only cons I found was the utter lack of free parking and the relatively expensive parking prices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sid_LAS_84
50,Awesome wax celebrities,We had a great time walking around looking at the wax celebrities. We were able to take lots of photos. I would recommend going.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ErickS15
30,you get what you pay for,For $17 it was not bad. We did not realize this was not THE wax museum (madame Tussauds) until after we LEFT Hollywood and mentioned how disappointed we were that most of the figures looked nothing like themselves! takes about ten minutes to walk through it all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yaquelin2
40,"For $17, it wasn't too bad!","We decided to go to this museum instead of Madame Tussanes since it was cheaper. You can definitely tell the difference between the two. This walking self pace tour is cool, the 'stars' don't look as real as at Madame Tussanes, but we still had a great time taking crazy pictures!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tosham
30,Not impressed,We paid too much money for a 10 min walk thru. I was pretty embarrassed of how the actors looked nothing like themselves.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DenaC564
50,Hollywood in Wax,"Right on Hollywood Boulevard along the Walk of Fame, it is Hollywood. All your favorite stars are represented, which is great since you probably won't see them in the real Hollywood any more. I can't imagine a tourist to Hollywood not stopping at this old institution.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
30,Good old fashioned cheesy fun :),"First off, this is no Madame Tussaud's! If you are expecting that caliber you will be sadly disappointed. The figures don't have the same amount of realism and the museum itself is pretty tired and beaten...but so is most of Hollywood. The upside is, unlike Tussauds, you can interact freely with the characters and have a blast...most figures are set up for you to do so. The price is average and you can sign up for their email promos and they immediately send you a coupon for a free 8x10 family picture with their Hollywood sign. We used it and it was great for free! Directly across from Guinness World Records...caddy corner from McDonalds and Ripleys. Metered parking available that takes plastic not coin, plus there are lots that average about $8 right around the corner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michelle_Haley
40,fun,grandkids loved it. i enjoyed it very much and have over the years. it still creeps me out how it looks though.prices aren't bad.parking is ok.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/188RobertT
40,"Fun, Fun, and Fun","The hubby and I had a blast here. The best part of course is the fact the museum is so interactive. We took tons of pictures and also enjoyed reading some of the interesting tidbits about our favorite celebrities. I believe there was only one figure we did not recognize, but besides that, everything was awesome! The price was also very reasonable at $17 a person.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tripre
40,Interactive,"I've been to a few wax museums but what I really liked about this one is you could pose with almost all of the figures (for pictures). My 19 year old daughter even, much to my horror, posed with Mr. Hefner on a round bed! I got to be one of the Charlies Angels doing a high kick. Really fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iLiveForVacay
40,Must Enter with the Right Attitude,"This place is a lot of fun if you go in with the right attitude and immediately after hitting a bar (or sneaking in a flask).Just know, that rarely will the wax figure actually look like the actor that it is meant to resemble. We had a lot of fun trying to guess the actor. Some of them are just so bad..in particular, Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore should sue the place for making them look so awful.The best part, is you are allowed to interact and take pictures. I climbed right into bed with Hugh Hefner and got some hilarious shots. Had we realized how much fun it would be to pose and take corny pictures, we probably would have brought some simple costumes or props. You can really go nuts in this place.I think that it would be a fun place for families..but it is a REALLY fun place for a group of rowdy, tipsy adults.Please visit my blog for tons of pictures (including the wax Diaz and Barrymore).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenH644
40,The best in Hollywood!,"I had heard that this wax museum was not great, but got a ticket for various attractions and this was on it. I had visited Madame Tussauds, so thought I had seen the best, however, when I attended this museum, I was VERY impressed! The ""house of horrors"" was AMAZING! Aliens from the Alien films, the warewolf from Michael Jacksons Thriller - both highlights. Star Wars and all the usual celebs.Very good museum, well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RhiRa
40,Something to do,"We wanted to waste sometime and just do a random tourist thing so we came here. We didn't have much expectations, thought it would be fun to take some funny photos. The price ain't cheap but whatever, we actually quite enjoyed ourselves. We took some fun photos and was funny to post them to facebook and had quite a few likes. The wax figures look quite real for the most part, it's either really real or not at all haha. All in all, this was a fun thing to spend a little time doing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kbeemz
40,Fun experience.,"I had never done any of the tourist attractions in Hollywood or LA and recently decided to. The wax museum has a lot of figures. Some are excellent and others are mediocre, but that is kind of fun because you marvel at the good ones and can laugh at the bad ones. Overall, the selection of figures/exhibits make it worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Erik4Travel
50,"""Hollywood wax museum""","We enjoyed every moment of it , all the lifelike movie stars,my family had a blast at taking pictures with all of the wax statues. I was expected to see more of the old hollywood stars, but was very please.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Iglesias12
50,Had a great time!,"I would not have expected to have had such a fun time at a tourist trap wax museum, but I had a great time! A friend got us tickets and we went since I love to try out tourist things… and we loved it, we laughed our way through. Lots of opportunity to take funny/silly shots with fake celebs. The scary/horror area is really wonderful. Was the best part of our day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoctorBuckles
30,If you pay full price you'll be sad,"Madame Tussaud's just a block away has more figures and higher quality figures but this one has some classics that Madame's does not; Lucille Ball, I dream of Genie, etc.. Get tickets on Groupon so you can do both!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisacY6590XA
20,Skip this one--go to Madame Tussaud,"Glad I purchased this on groupon for $15 for 2 because it SUCKED! The wax figures are nowhere near looking real, no fun to this place, it was completely dead..maybe us and 2 other people...I'm sure it's just a matter of time before it closes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lover4Travel
30,"B-Grade Equivalent of a Wax Museum, Not All Bad","It's old. It's campy. It's a B-grade equivalent of a wax museum. And it's not bad at all!Look, this is not a top-tier wax museum as the one a block or so away from it -- Madame Tussauds. But everyone should be able to tell that from the entrances to the two museums alone.The quality of the statues, as far as realism goes, varies significantly. Angelina Jolie and the Ninja Turtles are probably the best of the lot, while Leo DeCaprio or Jim Carrey don't look great at all. Tom Hanks and Michael Jackson are somewhere in the middle.There's also a spooky section which is not for the faint of heart. Please heed the warning signs outside, especially if you're with kids or teens (or an expectant mother).Still, the overall museum isn't bad for the price. If you believe you get what you pay for, you shouldn't mind this much.If you have a choice, choose Tussaud's, but you knew that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/inavigator
40,Fun place to visit,"A friend and I went to the Wax Museum with two teenage girls. We had a blast! Most of the celebrity figures were set up so that you could pose alongside them, so we laughed and laughed and took a ton of silly photos. The girls' favorite by a long shot was the Titanic bow, complete with Leo DiCaprio with arms extended and Celine Dion playing in the background! The museum wasn't too big, so we could finish it in about an hour and get all the shots we wanted.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DurangoFam
20,Save your money and go to Madam Tussards,"We visited both the Hollywood Wax Museum and go to Madame Tussauds Wax museum. The characters are more realistic, more current characters, and just more of them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LibLady

30,Fun but expensive. Do not confuse with Tussaud's,"We confused this place with Madame Tussaud's, which probably would have been better. Paid a lot to get in. We did have lots of fun taking pictures of kids with wax figures. Not all figures were that realistic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crazywith3kids
50,My Son Thought HE was a Movie Star,"My son, who was 24 at the time had a blast posing with the ""stars"". It wasn't very expensive and we really had a great time. Most of the figures are done very well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shakespeare213
30,Fun to see the stars in wax!,You can see the museum in an hour. I like the variety of stars presented.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/305HeatherM
20,Ok,I've never been to a wax museum before and I wanted to try it. But believe me when I say that I will not be going back to this museum if I ever go back to Hollywood. Some of the statues looked pretty real and then there were some that were just aweful looking. I'll have to try another was museum next time I'm in town.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shenea

30,Eh,"Just an OK place as far as actual wax figures go. Some of them were pretty realistic but others were just plain awful. The horror film area is neat, definitely gave me the creeps in a good way. I wouldn't pay to go in but I bought a 3 museum package (Ripley's, Guinness World Records and this museum) so we decided to check it out. I think it took us all of 12 minutes to walk thru, definitely not one of the best attractions LA has to offer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SueDahl
10,Worst Wax Models Ever,"This was the biggest ripoff. They rely on tourist so dont care about repeat business. The models are terrible, if it wasnt for the amaturish backgrounds we would have had no idea who some of them were.

40,Dont use your flash!,"Learned too late, don't use your flash inside the museum and you will amaze your friends with your photos with the ""stars'. use your flash like I did and it looks fake. We took our three kids, 11, 10 and 8 and we all had a ball posing for pictures,...even with those stars they didn't know. Museum is separated into sections of current and stars of the past - which makes it entertaining for the whole family. Definite recommend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GobClan
40,Fun!!,"We had fun taking pics of the kids with various stars, very realistic figures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kazzmich
40,Better than I thought and I enjoyed it!,"My teenage son wanted to see it and since we were on vacation, I thought ""Why not"" even though I thought the price was rather high at $25/adult. Always get the many coupons available in magazines, people handing out, etc to cut $5 off and get it to $20. Most of the figures are quite lifelike and what surprised us was the ability to touch and photograph yourselves in poses with them. (They just say do NOT touch any faces, hair or exposed parts.) We took some fun shots to email and phone send for fun to people! The walk along the strip with the many stars on the street and the many, many wanna-bes who dress up like Michael Jackson, Wonder Woman, Superman, etc adds to the shtick and fun of the crowd. Be sure to use the bathroom in the wax museum as there aren't many around that we could find. Fun time in Hollywood!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sasakidalem

40,Hollywood Wax Museum,Hey i liked this place and was pleasantly surprised. it was a pretty cool place to check out. I would recommend going for a couple of hours. Lots of life-size statutes of famous people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eyetacs
30,Better Than I Expected,"I purchased the tickets that allow entry into the Wax Museum, Guiness Book of Worls Records and the Ripley's Museum. Hionestly I thought the museum would be my least favorite and it ended up as my favorite out of the three. There were more figures than I expected and the props with some of the characters made it more appealing. They have several different themes and even my teeenagers had a a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/325robink
40,The things you can do with wax,When in Hollywood this is the museum to go to. It is amazing how they form the wax into people. You will see some of your favorite stars and singers. I love this place. It's a must see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YolandaM_12
30,The original wax museum,"We found the exhibits interesting, gives a sense of the history of Hollywood however some of the waxworks were poor representations of the stars they honoured, more noticeable now that Madame Tussauds has opened.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chris_Bren_248
40,Hollywood Wax Museum,"Came here with My awesome HubbY:). We bought the VIP package to the wax museum, Ripley's, and Guiness for $27; good deal just for $10 more to 2 other places. There was a statue out front, who looked fake. It wasnot and scared the crap out of them. This place is fun and you can pose with the figures, that is what We did. Some of the celebrities looked like themselves, however the others not so much. We enjoyed ThaT:). We walked through the horror-movie section and that was huge and fun and just awesome:). Thanks:).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrisHAnNDecE
40,Great for kids and pictures,"Great for kids to learn and appreciate the movie industry. Took lots of pictures with the wax figures, She (8 years old) loved it, even the spooky hallway. Doesn't take long-30 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffBransford
40,Way to bail out the Guinness Museum!,"We went to this museum because it was a rider on the Guinness Museum ticket,and I was presently surprised that the Wax Museum ended up being the better of the two. The museum was great - the characters were very lifelike and many that I would have chose myself. The haunted section is a nice touch as you could put a real person back there and scare someone with and they'd not know the difference until the person moved! If you have a few minutes, not a bad stop although I don't know how it stacks against the wax museum down the street by Graumann's.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Army_Dude
50,Fun for Everyone!,"Took a friend and 4 kids (ages 11-15) to the Hollywood Wax Musuem and everybody, including adults, had a good time. The musuem is well done with current movie stars and famous classics. Bring a camera, there are lots of photo ops, and even the older teens thought it was pretty cool. The horror section was fun and scary. I hadn't been there since I was a kid and it was great how they have updated it so we all recgonized our favorite star.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kp497
30,So-so,"I wanted to go here as I was here a long time ago as a child. Was pretty disappointed. I'd say about half or less of the figures looked liked the real person. Got through it pretty fast. We had fun taking pictures with the figures but did not think it was worth the admission, even coupled with the Guinness Book of Records across the street which was also so-so - seems in need of a massive update. Wish we would have gone to Madame T's down the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/girlcat
30,Good but not super,Bought ticket as combo with Guinness World records museum across the street. Price for these 2 together is ok. About 15/16 dollar. The wax museum has good resembling was 'persons' but also many which don't look good. We (my wife and 2 kids of 8 and 11 and I) still had a good time. We took many pictures with the ones that did look good. It's probably not as good as Madame T. which if a little bit further akLong this street. All in all we did enjoy taking the pictures with some of the celebs but know that not all of them look like the real stuff.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marten162
50,Lots of fun; upclose with the stars!,"We truly enjoyed the interactive fun of posing with the different wax stars in this museum. The figures were very realistic, the facility was extremely clean and well-kept, and there was lots of room to move around & see everything. It was also a great escape from the crowds and heat on Hollywood Boulevard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieJ0122
30,"Not bad, not something I would recommend spending your money on.","This was a cool place to see (once) but it wasn't worth the money, I would recommend keeping your money and spending it on a nice place to eat. Could have been kept up better, each character had about an inch of dust on it. Not thrilled.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Akirch
20,Not so good - Very disappointing,I was very disappointed in this attraction. I guess it comes along with the price we paid. Its a combo ticket for the Wax museum and the Guiness World Records Museum across the street. We didnt enjoy either and feel it was a waste of money. After being so disappointed - we went to Madame Tussands Wax Museum down hollywood blvd near Grauman's Chinese theater. If you want to see a nice Wax museum - GO TO MADAME TUSSANDS!!! So worth the money.Dont waste your time or money at Hollywood Wax Museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bmxmom38
10,Terrible Waste of Time and Money,"We bought this as part of the 3 attraction package at Ripley's Believe it or Not.. an $11 upsell. The other attraction was the Guiness Book of Records museum which after the Wax Museum, we didn't even bother. The was figures were just bad. I agreed with the previous reviewer, who said Samuel Jackson was the only good one. Give the money to a homeless person, you will feel better",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheTruckingCouple
20,Wish I would have read the reviews before we went!,"My husband and I were killing some time while in Hollywood, so we thought we would go check out the wax museum. What a waste of money that was. I didn't think the wax figures looked very good at all. The only one that looked good was Samuel Jackson. Some of the figures look cheap and very old. I wasn't too impressed at all. My husband and I both walked around with a disapointed look on our faces... both hoping it would get better and it really didn't. Don't waste your time on this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jwg415
10,You will be disappointed and feel ripped off!,"This place stays in business only by the fact its on Hollywood Blvd at 'Ground Zero' and its patrons don't know any better.95% of the thirty-odd full-figure displays are old, discolored and falling apart. Someone mentioned they look to have leprocy - I could not have stated it better myself! The next 5% are newer but cheaply done and very fake. Not life-like at all. There was one new figure of Samuel L. Jackson - this one was very realistic, and very well done - the only thing the owners have spent any money on.The sets and backgrounds are actually very well done, and I was impressed with them. But the wax figures - which you are there to see - are a joke.Cost of $15.95 per adult for this place is theivery. You will feel cheated out of your money. On the other hand, if you want a good laugh and won't miss the money, by all means check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/live2hike
30,Cute and Funny,This was the first place we visited while in Hollywood. My daughter and I loved it. They did a pretty good job on the celebrites featured. We took several pictures with the wax figures. I thought it was a cute place to visit while in Hollywood. I am surprise this isn't more popular.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/turkey2009
10,Waste of Time,"I visit this museum 'cause it still open until 1 am.The ticket gives you access to both Wax and Guiness Museums.It's awful, the wax statues are terrible, didn't look like the real people, you cannot touch them (like Madam Toussad), the place looks old and it's very small.By the way, the Guiness Museum is even worse.Don't go there, even if the entrance was free, it's waste of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HFB128813
30,"Not the greatest attraction, but fun for a while","I have never been to Madame Toussauds so I can't say whether or not this place holds a candle to that, but from the other reviews, I would say that people think it doesn't. I however did enjoy this wax museum and, though it was short, I did get some great pictures. The price is a little much for how short it is (it only took us about fifteen minutes to get through), so I don't think I would recommend others do it for that reason.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripulartravels
10,"Yeah, New York was waaaay better too","This was another gem on our LA ""Go Card"" that we buzzed through in about 20 minutes. The quality is terrible and all of the figures are roped off (in NYC you can pose for pics with them). I would not take anyone back here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmmaTahoe
10,Doesn't hold a candle to Madame Toussaud's,"After having visited (and enjoyed) Madame Toussaud's Wax Museum in London, my wife and I thought it would be fun to take our young daughter to see the Hollywood Wax Museum. Boy were we disappointed.The majority of the figures were in need of repair with their ""skin"" so discolored and blotchy that they appeared to have leprosy. And many of the figures looked nothing like the characters they purported to represent.In fact our daughter, a Jim Carrey fan, refused to believe that the poorly lit character Ace Ventura was indeed the goofy Jim Carrey despite the sign in front of the exhibit. And why, 12 years after their heyday would anyone display the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?On the way out you'll notice three figures up above you. While they look like the Pep Boys, rest assured they're the Three Stooges--at least that's what the sign said.I suggest you save your money for the tour of the Hollywood Stars' Homes. At least you'll get a tan while you get less than you paid for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcbcpa
