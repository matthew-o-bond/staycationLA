50,What's better than a great church?,"One with an amazing view, possibly. This place is magical. The ministers are wonderful, interesting, and very well-read. Somehow seeing nature right there, just outside the sanctuary, makes the service more meaningful. There is also a labyrinth there as well. A great place to meditate and relax.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ace90266
50,Beautiful ocean views and peaceful prayer labyrinth,"Visited on a Sunday afternoon after the church was already closed and locked up after their morning services. We were able to enter the grounds toward the back to walk around and enjoy the views. It was a beautiful clear day. We found the amazing prayer labyrinth they have in the back, overlooking the ocean. We had a peaceful time of reflection. It was gorgeous!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imskimmy
50,Beautiful venue,I've been to three weddings and two memorials and I am always amazed at the beauty of the church and the surrounding area. Right on the water. The venue is lovely. Both memorials had wonderful receptions. I don't know when it is open except on Sundays. Am sure they have open hours at other times.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrimoin

50,Great Wedding VenueMy nephew was married there. It was beautiful.,Beautiful setting on the Palos Verdes Coast. Great grounds for photos and an incredible coastline view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/724kathleenb
50,Worth a visit,"Have been to many weddings and funerals at the Neighborhood Church but have also just taken a minute to walk the grounds on a beautiful day. If in Palos Verdes it is worth a stop just to take advantage of the setting and the architecture of one of our ""historic"" buildings. Step out on the patio and also stroll the gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marilynh286
50,Outstanding Views......Peaceful.....Lovely and Colorful Plants and Flowers,Visit the historical church for the ambience. Enjoy the area and the views.

40,Treasure in Malaga Cove,This former private mansion has been lovingly renovated into a beautiful church and grounds right on the water for reflection and meditation. The hours that it is open are limited so it is best to phone first unless you are planning on attending Sunday worship or a special function. Sometimes there are concerts and other public events.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/olinmom
50,Extraordinarily Beautiful!,"Wow! This is a jewel in a magnificent setting. The Haggarty's mansion overlooking the ocean has been restored as a church and is one of the most beautiful historic locations in Palos Verdes. The architecture, grounds and interior details are one of a kind. It is a sought after location for weddings. Several Sunday evenings in the summertime it has picnic seating on the terrace followed by outdoor music concerts and sometimes they have an organ concert on their highly acclaimed organ. There are regular worship services there each Sunday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/galapagoer
50,Charming church overlooking the ocean,"Very active congregation, festive Sunday services, great programs for all ages not only on Christmas Eve. BTW, we got married there, unforgettable! This church will always feel like home for our family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UlrikeZ280

50,A truly beautiful church and so much more!,"Our daughter, son in law, and grandchildren have recently moved to this area and took us here to church. Oh my goodness! The setting, an old estate now turned into a church (read the history from other reviewers -- it is very interesting!) is nothing short of spectacular! The architecture is very distinguished, and the buildings cling to the edge of a cliff with breathtaking views out over the sparkling Pacific Ocean! We found the church service very nice. We were warmly greeted both before and after the service. The sermon that day was very memorable and my husband and I still talk about it to this day. After church coffee and light refreshments were served on the patio overlooking the ocean. Since it is an old estate property the barrier fence (no you don't want to fall over -- it's a long ways down!) is very decorative. All of the buildings are most attractive and elegant with sweeping vistas all around. There are several levels of terraces on the seaward side of the property with steps connecting them, and also…my favorite part…a beautiful labyrinth overlooking the ocean as well! I have come back several times since my initial visit, both by myself and with my grandchildren, to walk this lovely labyrinth, each time coming away with a pervading sense of peace and gratitude and calm. Large and beautifully manicured lawns frame one side of the buildings with lovely landscaping. I highly recommend attending Neighborhood Church. I believe you will find it a most special experience! A side tip: For those of you not familiar with the neighborhood, there is a very nice beach on a cove nearby that you may wish to visit also. To reach the beach go to the parking lot of Malaga Cove Elementary School nearby and walk down the path on the far end of the parking lot to the water (the path is steep at first but becomes flat as you reach the water). There are no restrooms at this beach but the water is often quite warm and truly delightful! The views are a 10 out of 10!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelgirl93463
50,This gorgeous 1920's Italian style villa is a church!,"Neighborhood Church is a beautiful place to worship. They have two services each Sunday as well as programs throughout the year. A member of the United Church of Christ, Neighborhood Church is a warm and inviting place to explore your faith. It was built in 1927 for JJ Haggarty and is one of the original grand estates built on the Palos Verdes Peninsula. When his business fell on hard times during the 1930's the home was sold and was left largely empty for many years. The founding members of Neighborhood Church purchased the property in 1950 and then converted it into the wonderful building it is today.Whether looking for a church home, or a place for a wedding or memorial service, Neighborhood Church has much to offer. I first visited because a girl friend was thinking about getting married there. I happened to visit on the Sunday of their annual Vespers Service. I was intrigued so we back at 5 pm for the service. I was blown away! They had a 17 piece orchestra and about a 30 voice choir performing a requiem. It was simply stunning.This is a must see for a bit of Palos Verdes Estates history and worthy of a visit for a service.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KFrasier
