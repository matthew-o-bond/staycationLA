50,Iconic,"When wandering Hollywood Blvd spare a few minutes for a walk to see the Capitol Records building, you won't be disappointed, iconic and worth a viewing, might see some one famous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeamWard
50,Marvellously distinctive,"Close by the famous Hollywood & Vine intersection, it is one of the most individualistic edifies in the city.Symbolising a stack of LPs or 45s, it produced some classic recordings by legends such as Frank Sinatra, Beach Boys and Paul McCartney.A couple of intriguing aspects of its design include its tall spire that flashes the word Hollywood in Morse Code. Apropos which it was fitting that the granddaughter of Samuel Morse, the code’s creator, switched this feature on during the opening celebrations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
50,A True Los Angeles Icon,"One of the most iconic buildings in the city, it really leaves an impression whether you're driving by on the 101 or walking around Hollywood! It is a very distinctive cylindrical shape stacked with ring-like levels and topped with a stylized spire that lights up ""Hollywood"" in Morse code at night.Even though this has been pointed out by everyone regarding the building, it does look very similar to a set of vinyl records stacked on top of one another which makes sense for a record studio and gives it even more of a legendary status.It would be nice if this building was open for tours because it is such a famous landmark and if those walls could talk, they would have so many stories to tell of the great musicians (Frank Sinatra, The Beach Boys, The Beatles, etc) who have walked through those hallowed halls since its construction in 1956.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colbys2014
30,Iconic Hollywood Landmark,While the building isn’t open to the public it is still cool to see this historic landmark when you are in Hollywood. There are Hollywood Walk of Fame stars are also on Vine St which passes in front of this building so you can take in both sights at the same time which is handy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodyt4130

50,"Historic, architectural, literical, and a marvel!","Historic, architectural, lireical, and a marvel! What is unseen are the recording studios where major music has been created. Often demolished in films, such as Earthquake, and is visually an important iconic building in Los Angeles. Easily viewed from Hollywood Boulevard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
30,Icon from the past,This was just a short walk from our Kimpton hotel... not too far from the Metro and from Hollywood Boulevard... there are stars here on the walkway too... It is just a building not much more to say really but worth a walk out to take a photo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travellerm68
40,Icon,I had the pleasure of taking a tour here a few years ago when the Walk of Fame was celebrating an anniversary. It was AWESOME!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnRyan724
30,Its cool,"Capitol Records is iconic. It would be really cool if they had tours, but it is an open business. The shape of the old 45 record and the needle up on top, when you point it out you will get ooohs and aahs. Photos are a must.This icon is in many movies but younger folks might not know or care what it is and its value,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saw55
40,Love old architecture!,This place does not disappoint. I had seen it from the freeway many times but never up close. It was worth a peek. Wish I could have seen the inside. But very cool.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/siropderable
50,Cool Story,Swung by as a part of my day-long tour. The building is a site to behold. It's circular structure is a first of its kind and represents a stack of records on a record player.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leaving_Samsara
40,Vitally important to music fans....,"....and deep down, isn't that all of us? I'm 61 but my tastes in music is much older than that due to influences from my mother and my babysitter. So if you are a music history buff. Or if you like American popular jazz like Nat ""King"" Cole or Frank Sinatra. Or if you are an American who is a Beatles fan. Or if you wanted to to ride the waves (which they really didn't do) or ride the charts (of which they were the masters) with the Beach Boys... You have to go here and take a few selfies. So why only 4 $tars? You can't get in. The people who own Capitol Records would win tons of accolades if they would open the place to the public for a few days a year. This needn't be a charitable thing. I'd be willing to bet they could find it a profitable venture while winning lots of PR Points. I hope they read this (but they've probably heard it all before).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JerryPPhoenix
40,It's The Capitol Records Building! Nuff Said!,"A must do photo opportunity when you're in Hollywood, especially for a Beatles fan like myself.

40,Iconic Hollywood building,"A bit of a walk from Hollywood boulevard (slightly iffy neighbourhood), do it in daylight. Well worth the walk and its still looking fabulous after all these years, great photo place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeamWard
40,"Round, not as popular, but still cool","There was a time when this was a must see LA icon. However, there are now many round buildings and records are more known for accomplishments than music. Still I was excited to see this building on our Hollywood tour because of its history. Again, while it may not be as popular, seeing a building shaped like a stack of records that has seen the legends of the music industry is still cool and great for pictures. If your in Hollywood or on the 101, you will see it and be glad you did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GroverR

50,"Bucket list, one less !","Excellent place to visit!! A lot of history (The Beatles, John Lennon among others... ) beside you have good restaurants around it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gmirabal
40,Landmark LA building,"It is hard to rate this one because it is a landmark Los Angeles building but is kind of overshadowed by so many other large buildings now. However, it is significant for a number of reasons. Built in 1956, it has featured in a number of Hollywood Movies (e.g. Earthquake and Hancock) and has been the recording home of some iconic recording artists including Nat King Cole, Frank Sinatra, The Beatles and The Beach Boys. Contrary to popular urban myth that it was built to resemble a stack of vinyl records (which it does), in reality, it was built with less external walls (due to its circular shape) to purposely cut down on construction and air conditioning costs. Presumably this was made up for in costs by some of the specialist recording studios, including an underground reverberation recording chamber engineered by the legendary guitarist Les Paul. So, it has a lot of history, but perhaps people may be expecting it to be a bit bigger when they see it. It is just north of Hollywood and Vine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Belgo96
30,Iconic part of LA,"This oddly shaped building is beautiful and has some history behind it. Frank Sinatra used to record there and has a hall named after him.

30,Quick picture opportunity,"We used our GPS to find this iconic building when we were in town and found it with no problem.

30,Really Nothing Impressive,"We stopped by the building as part of our city tour and as much as it was pretty cool to see it, there is really nothing that impressive about it. The architecture is a little different and unique and there is some cool history behind it. It is obviously one of the most famous buildings in all LA with so many celebrities getting their start there. It was worth a few pictures and that was pretty much it for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveRainville99
40,Famous Landmark,"First familiar landmark for me after stopping at Hollywood/Vine metro station. I walked around it heading to my hotel.

30,Nothing to see but the outside of the building,"Unfortunately, my visit to the Capitol Records building was a bit disappointing. The building is a cool, unique building.... great for a picture of two, but that was it.They have nothing there to see or do. You can't even get in the building unless you fake being a rock star or something! We tried but were stopped by the guard.I was at least expecting a gift shop or record outlet or something. This would be easy money for them. But, no, nothing! Do you wonder why the record industry is in trouble?Anyway, check out Amoeba Music (also in town) if you want to see something record related.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MasterTravelMan

30,Iconic Building - well worth a detour,"No need to ham this up, it's a working record studio so there are no tours.
