50,Easy way around LA,"We used the metro on our first visit to LA. it was easy to use/navigate around, cheap for us as we all bought day passes which we could also use on the buses as well. The carriages were clean and there were a few comical moments. As tourists we would use this again.",Zoe C
10,Dark Ages,"The LA transport system, like many public transport systems in the US is absolutely flawed. I do not know where to begin. Miraculously the Metro does allow you to purchase passes for your Tap card online. Unfortunately, the passes sometimes don't work for up to 3 days... so if you want to get the bus down the road then you may need to plan 72 hours in advance if you're not buying on board. Secondly, we opted to purchase 1 day passes at the cost of $7 as we were informed, and later found out, that the arrival times of many buses are so unpredictable that you're better of covering yourself for the day rather than buying a one way pass where you may not make a simple journey within the time frame... Thirdly, the buses and train were not clean, nor did they seem safe at all. Despite having gates to metro stations, there were many homeless people on the platforms and boarding the trains, walking up and down asking for money. Both the trains and buses smelt awful as well. If LA wasn't so big then I probably would've just paid the price for Uber or Lyft, however I feel like you're forced to take public transport on a limited budget.",Michael
50,Easy way Around Los Angeles,"Looking for a great way to get around LA and other areas. The metro rail is great. Connecting you to other trains and rail lines, the gold line is the best method of transportation to keep you moving and out of the LA traffic. Very affordable, safe and very well maintained as far as cleanliness.",Dax
30,Easy but old,"The metro is easy to get at.Just load your card and go $1,75 for a single ride or buy a day card. The metro and trains/wagons are old and out of date.",Highcoaster
50,Hollywood Murals,"We travelled from Hollywood / Highland to 7th street Downtown station, the signs were easy to understand the service great and the murals marvellous, clean as well, or only experience was spot-on.",TeamWard
30,Somewhat better than expected,"I've always heard terrible things about LA's transit system. ""Nobody"" uses it, you have to have a car to get around the city, etc. It's better than that, but it still has a ways to go to rival the public transportation of pretty much any city the size of LA in the world. The city is a challenge with its small downtown and spread-out neighborhoods, and it's likely to take 90 minutes to get anywhere. The rail lines help (above ground almost always, you can't call them subways) but they don't go everywhere. You'll often want to take a bus. Download a good transit app like Moovit, Transit, or Citymapper, buy a day pass, and have some patience. Also, load your Metro TAP card with some extra cash. Many bus lines are not part of the system and they won't take a day pass, but they aren't expensive. These lines like the Big Blue Bus or Culver City buses cost just a dollar or so and they do use the same TAP cards, just not the passes, and sometimes they'll take a small transfer charge instead of a full fare. One of the best surprises was the Metro's Bus Rapid Transit called the Silver Line. It uses dedicated lanes and stops within the I-110 freeway for service that's as fast as a subway.",MarkLBoston
10,LA metro crappy service,"LA metro is expensive, dirty and never on time. The system is useless. They even have 2nd floor highways on the I-110. The solution is very simple. Make ALL public transportation in LA absolutely free of charge. Advertise it well. And see how people will leave their cars and use your system. Supply all the buses in the world to accommodate for this shift. Pay everything from advertisement on the buses and rails or simply our extremely high taxes with no rewards whatsoever. Other countries with similar high taxes, they have free health, education, proper infrastructure for their people. We have nothing, we get virtually nothing from our taxes compared to the other Western world countries. We are the worst among them in terms of caring about the people. Anyway, in a city that is dying with its noise and air pollution. Only the government can help. But they simply don't care.",John Dupree
40,Everyday Commute to Work,"I ride the metro lines everyday for work. Los Angeles traffic is so bad that the time I spend on the trains is equal to or greater than the time it would take me to drive 35 miles. Even though the trains have issues at times and don’t always run on schedule like other cities, it still is less stressful than driving and one doesn’t have to find or pay for parking!!",Cheryl Lyn R
30,Disappointed,"In major cities, my first choice of site seeing and travelling if to use light rail annd Amtrack. While summering in California this year, I was disappointed that the light rail from Long Beach to Los Angeles (Blue Line) was dow from LB to Comptopn. Buses would shuttle, but that's not my cup of tea. Hopefully nex season will be better. The overall rail system is worht exploring. I'm hoping I can keep my wheels at the campground next year",Thom M
50,Day in Hollywood,"We took the Metro from Orange County to Hollywood for a performance at the Panteges. On Saturday and Sunday you can buy an all day pass for $10 and use it to get everywhere the Metro goes, what a great deal! it's easy and convenient, you don't have to worry about driving in traffic or paying an arm and a leg to park.

40,An Adventure Every Time You Ride,"Weekly I take the Gold Line into L.A. from the Sierra Madre station for an art class. We get off at different stops to sketch & paint L.A. We also quick sketch the Metro riders. The Metro has been reliable and fast. During rush hours it is crowded. There are interesting people that ride the Metro from business suits, college kids to street people. Sometimes there are scary, crazies but they seem to stay to themselves. If you are over 65 you can get a Senior Citizen Tap Card which makes the rides very affordable.",lynndds
50,Metro Rail Art Tours,"Metro has 2-hour free tours of various Metro places. We went on the Union Station tour, which also covered a couple of stations on the red line and some buildings nearby. It was great! Angela was our guide, and although the tour was in Spanish she translated into English for us too. We live in LA and had never even heard of the Fine Arts building, which was beautiful. If you want to get to know different parts of the city, Metro has tours of Gold Line stations, Hollywood and North Hollywood stations, and probably others.",hurleynancy
10,Horrible,"I cannot believe some of the reviews. This was not my experience. The blue was partially shutdown, the green line had 2 stops open, and buses serve the gaps. It took us over an hour to go 8 stops on the blue line via bus. No signage that service wasn’t working. It took nearly 3 hours from metro center to lax airport. Never again. I’d rather walk or ride a bike and control the situation.",dafos27

Buy a TAP Card at the station, load some cash to it and you're off! We found that the daily $7 fill up suited our needs but there are plenty of other options. We used the Metro Rail to visit Hollywood and Santa Monica, and a combination of train and bus to visit Rodeo Drive and the Griffith Observatory (a must)! The Metro is a great service and easy to use.",Lowball
40,Great to use & safe,"Good cheap way to get around LA. Buy a plastic card at one of the stations. You keep this & then load it with pre-paid journies at the ticket machines. Easy to use. Stops the hassle of driving around grid locked LA. I have read they are extending the different metro lines. At the moment the trains are not tooo busy. Trains run late. As the network is expanding, find out what bus routs exist near your station for the other directions.Great mode of transport.",Duncan

40,Nothing wrong with the Metro just some of the people that use it!,We had a 2 night stop over in a LAX hotel which had the metro right next door. Looking at the map we saw we could get to Santa Monica so decided to go. The station was Mariposa and it was very easy to get a TAP card which cost $2 for the card then $7 for all day travel each.A train arrived very promptly and we were pleasantly surprised to see how clean it was.We were headed for the Blue line exchange at Rosa Parks. There weren't many people using the train and we felt that we stood out a bit being caucasian seniors!We were spoken to by a couple of people one being a gang member in his bandana and another who extolled the bible for a good 10 minutes! we must say though we had no problems as such.When we got to Rosa Parks the blue line was closed and we had no idea where to go. We went outside and were helped by members of the public who showed us where to catch a bus to 103rd street. This took about 15 minutes. There were plenty of workmen around and good signage to the station. We caught the Blue line to Pico where we had to change to the expo line for Santa Monica. There was a lot more people on the Blue line but it went through some not very nice areas. People getting on smelt of cannabis and 1 woman spoke on her mobile phone in a very loud voice where every second word was a bad swear word!When we got to Pico there was security there and we saw plenty of security all along the expo line which is much better than the Blue Line. My husband was wearing a fairly expensive Swiss watch and decided to remove it so as not to be too conspicuous.The whole journey to Santa Monica took 2 hours!! These trains are not fast and are really light rail not subway.The station at Santa Monica is about an 8 minute straight walk to the pier.Going back we reversed the journey and it was slightly quicker as we knew what we were doing with the buses.This is a good service but wether they are making any money is debatable. We had our Tap cards and tapped away but never saw anybody else pay!!All the trains were clean and quite comfortable but would we repeat the experience probably not if the Blue line was involved! We were glad to return to our hotel after our adventure!LA metro represents very good value for money. It is certainly not a service we would use at nightime,KiwichickAuckland
50,Cheap Travel,"If you're like me and don't want to pay an arm and a leg to get from LAX to Downtown then Metro Rail is the way to go. The system is pretty easy to understand and the 1 Day Pass comes in handy when you want to pick up and go. It doesn't get close to all of the must-see places without a little walking like Rodeo Drive and Venice Beach, but it's definitely faster than waiting for a ride share to scoop you up depending on the location.",CheekyGold
40,Ideal for Hollywood My Trip,"I used the Metro a couple of times when I was holiday in Hollywood for a few days, it was super convenient.Very easy to buy Tap cards from the machine, single trips are cheap, a little over $1 to get from Hollywood/Vine to Hollywood/Highland.The station at Vine end is huge and airy. The architecture is really cool and the ceiling looks like old film reels.Once on the train each station is announced, so I knew exactly when my stop was coming up.Having only used the system over a couple of days I can't comment on reliability,",TashW35
40,Useful option to car rental,"We stayed near Santa Monica and found the Metro a useful way to get around between downtown LA and the beach. Frequent trains, fairly clean and safe. Purchase a card from a vending machine and pre-load cheap trip fares onto it (although no-one appeared to check and the ticket barriers were generally open). Reduction for senior citizens. Fairly late-running/early starting. Recommended!",Baz B
30,Relatively good system,"As much as the trains we used arrived on time, the experience can be different dependent on the quality of the train carriage. Plenty of ‘undesirables’ appear to use the system for the shelter and there are some fetid cars. Not quite as old-fashioned as other metro systems. Reasonably easy to navigate yourself on.",Greg

40,Didn't plan on riding,We had an untoward experience with our renta car and a Hollywood tow truck service. Left stranded and afoot we needed to be at LAX in just a few hours for our flight back to Montana.Finding the station was easy. There was 2 uniformed security officers at the entrance who were quite friendly and helpful. We rode the last train for the night out of Hollywood to Pershing Square. The wait area was clean. The only people hanging out in the wait area were bona fide passengers. The car appeared safe. What we were not able to figure out how and where to pay for our ride. There was a ticket sale vending machine that ate my money on one attempt so we just forgot about paying for our ride. I didn't see a ticket man or any other place even checking if someone had a ticket or pass. It appeared to us the ticketing or payment for the underground is on the honor system.,ravilya2018
50,Great value and way to take away the stress of driving.,This is the second time to take the metro up to Los Angeles. Riding the metro takes of all of the stress of worrying about that drive in traffic. I love the fact that the kids have room to move around and can play games on the ride. It is clean and on the way back the conductor came up to talk to us and he told my grand daughters some of the responsibilities that he had as a conductor. Really nice trip,Ldiva001

40,A Great Way To Get Around,"Los Angeles natives like to complain about the traffic but amazingly, hardly anyone uses the metro to get around. It’s true that it can’t get you everywhere, but I found the metro to be clean, efficient, and easy to navigate.

30,Easy way to get around LA!,"Public transportation comes with many different issues. Metro is no different. We got our TAP cards Saturday and used them all 4 days. Once we figured out vending machine it was easy to reload the cards. Can get frustrating on when to tap and when to GO. Easy transfers after we got around once. Issues are- 1. Sounds, some people do not care about bad language. 2. Smells, body odor and the constant smell of marijuana. One train had a man smoking pot on the train. 3. Amazing how many don't pay. 4. Security could be utilized more effectively. More than a few times we would see groups of officers huddled together ""boys being boys"" and down the platform would be someone smoking and/or eating and drinking. They would even look right at them and ignore the situation. Not sure if there is a ""Pick your battles"" type policy. Once we had two officers board the train and they were very friendly with the passengers of all types. That was nice to see. We will use Metro again on our next visit.",NWO Traveler

30,It’s just a subway,"I’m not even sure why this is listed as an attraction. It’s just a subway. It’s mildly useful for getting around LA. I guess since this is about Metro Rail it also includes the light rail portion of the system which, again, is just light rail. Nothing exciting to see here. Some stations have public art (Union Station is historic and art itself). Train cars are typical clean. Prices are reasonable.",Mark
10,so very sad and dirty,"Taking the subway in LA you will see many homeless and gangs traveling or sleeping in the rail cars. I have seen naked people sitting in their own waste like it is normal so very sad. Oh and parking in one of the parking lots, do not be surprised if your car is broken into when you get back to it. There is no camera's covering the parking lots and the security is not looking after it as there is not enough of them on site. LA Metro needs to fix so many things but they never do.",Mitch F
50,Awesome! Who needs a car in LA?,"We lived 7 years in Southern California, and always drove everywhere. The 405 and 210 Freeways became our ""friends"". But now, visiting family, we decided to use the metro subway to visit downtown LA.What a treat! The Red Line is awesome - as quick, clean and efficient as any urban rail service anywhere. It leaves NYC and London for dead. Sure, riders are fewer, but, even so, LA has pulled off something really good here.We connected at LA Union Station - very easily and efficiently, purchased cards which were very simple to use and extremely easy to recharge (and we are seniors!).We saw everything we wanted to see downtown by metro, and a couple of buses.Ditch the car. Use the rail. Completely remove stress and get there way faster.",367john
20,Recharge machines are awful!,"We are only in LA for the week so my partner and I got a travel tap card (you have to get it for $2) just to use the subway. We are in Hollywood and needed to get to the staples centre and the universal studios via the metro rail. The most painful thing in the world was when we tried to recharge the cars on the machines to pay for our fair. We tried a travel money card and a master card and a Visa card on multiple machines at different times and it was always chance if it worked or not. It became incredibly frustrating and I’ve honestly never encountered something so painful. Like it would work for one of our passes and declined the next pass despite as trying 4 different machines and using 3 different mastercards. In better news, the rail network is very easy to understand and almost every rail station has police there which made us feel much more safe.",Chris M

40,I'm A Car Guy,I can't remember the last time I rode a bus in Los Angeles until the I rode the Expo Line (rail) from West Los Angeles to Downtown LA. I was surprised how easy and convenient it was once I figured out how to purchase (load the card) the fare and where I was going. Now it is common for me to take the Expo Metro to Downtown LA or to the ocean in Santa Monica.,Ed E
50,Great ride,"I love Metro Rail, so comfortable and so energy-saving. It's not too far from my home, so it is quite convenient for me. I use Metro Rail whenever I want to go shopping downtown, what a great way to go.",var00ja
40,Very exciting for Angelenos.,Metro rail is a huge improvement over what we had before. You can now take the Expo line light rail from Santa Monica all the way downtown. Even though it takes about an hour and you have to change trains it is worth the experience.,Hilary S
30,Crash Course on LA Metro Rail,"LA's metro system consists of two different types of rail: light rail (Expo, Blue, Gold, Green Lines), heavy rail (Red, Purple Lines). There are two busways which have color names as well (Orange, Silver).For tourists, you usually pay fares in one of two ways:-Cash Value: i.e. you pay $1.75 for a trip w/ free unlimited transfers between Metro buses and rail for 2 hours, and $0.50 to other agencies.-Passes: i.e. Day pass $7 or 7-Day Pass $25Most tourists should get a TAP card with Stored Value, as it's usually the cheapest option. Stored Value now automatically takes into account free and interagency transfers, so all you have to do is tap your card every time you board a new bus or train. Unless you're going to be riding the LA Metro bus or rail for more than 4 trips a day, a day pass isn't worth it. Also, if you're going to be taking Santa Monica Big Blue Bus, Culver City Bus, Foothill Transit, or any other agency's buses, a Metro day pass won't work for them.Heavy Rail Overview:There are 2 heavy rail lines in LA. They are grade separated subway and are usually faster than the light rail lines. The two lines run along the same tracks through Downtown before branching off to the West and North. The Red Line runs from Union Station in Downtown LA to North Hollywood Station in the San Fernando Valley (""the valley""), passing parts of Koreatown, the Hollywood tourist sites, and Universal City (Universal Studios patrons can take a shuttle from the station). The Purple Line is currently a stub that runs from Union Station in Downtown LA to Wilshire / Western Station in Koreatown, sharing all but two stations with the Red Line. Most people use the Purple Line just to get between places in Downtown. Both lines run every ten minutes during peak hours, so in Downtown trains usually come every 5 minutes during peak hours.Heavy Rail Tips/Takeaways:-The service is often very infrequent during off-peak hours, sometimes as bad as every 20 minutes or more when construction is going on.-Digital arrival signage usually doesn't work, so make sure you check NextBus online on your phone before you enter a station where cell service is spotty.-Trains heading towards DTLA are all called ""train to Union Station"" in announcements and signage, and trains heading out of DTLA are called ""Purple Line Train to Wilshire / Western"" or ""Red Line Train to North Hollywood.""-Sometimes, the Purple line runs as a shuttle between Wilshire / Western and Wilshire / Vermont and you have to transfer to the Red Line to get to DTLALight Rail Overview:There are 4 Light Rail lines in LA. Most run on tracks in a variety of settings: at-grade (with cars), aerial, and below grade subway, which can make them unreliable or slower at times. The Expo Line is most useful for tourists as it goes from Santa Monica to DTLA, in about 45 minutes, passing through Sawtelle Japantown, Culver City, and Expo Park (USC, Natural History Museum, Science Center, etc.). The Blue Line goes from DTLA to Long Beach, passing Watts (Watts Towers). The Green Line has a station that has a shuttle to LAX Airport, but in most cases I would recommend taking the FlyAway bus to your destination if you can. The Gold Line is C-shaped and goes from Azusa to East LA through Downtown, passing Pasadena, Little Tokyo, Chinatown, and Union Station.Light Rail Tips/Takeaways:-Service is usually pretty good (e.g. about every 6-10 minutes)-Make sure you tap your TAP card on a validator (column like thing with pad on top) at the station before boarding if the station doesn't have turnstiles.-Oftentimes, especially on the Expo Line, voice announcements are out of sync on the trains, so make sure you look at the station signage before you get off the train to make sure you're actually at the right station.-Lots of quick jerky motions on street-running sections, so hold on.-Don't mix up the Blue Line (dark blue color) with the Expo Line (light blue color) which both share track in DTLA.The system is rapidly expanding, with new rail lines planned to connect LAX Airport, Westwood, Beverly Hills, West Hollywood, and other tourist destinations to the rest of the network. While LA's metro system leaves much to be desired, there is hope for a more transit friendly LA.",Gregory G
50,EXCELLENT SERVICE AT REASONABLE PRICE,"If I compare Metro fare with respect to other big cities in US, Metro rail LA appeared cheaper and user friendly to us. The one day pass was $7 only. However, we purchased a 7day pass although we stayed for 4 days. This is due to the fact that 7 day pass was cheaper than 4 nos 1 day pass. All the trains were net and clean. Foods and drinks were not allowed in the trains and thus they looked very clean.We reached Los Angeles by Amtrak bus and took our 7 day pass from the Union station. The pass was loaded on a TAP card, which was $2 only and obtained from the same Ticket vending machine. Card payment was accepted. Thus, spending $27, we had unlimited pass for Metro and Buses.There are various lines in Metro and these are:• Red Line• Purple line• Blue Line• Expo Line• Green Line• Gold LineRed line was used by us for going to Union station, Hollywood and Universal studio.Expo line was used for going to Venice beach by taking a bus from Culver city stop and then bus to Santa Monica BeachGreen line can be used for going to LAX airport by taking free shuttle from Aviation/LAX, although we used Fly bus.Blue line was used for going to Long Beach",DPMALLIC

40,combo bus & rail can get to most tourist attractions,"The system here uses a tap card which one can get at any light rail station or you can still use cash on the buses its exact change only. Consider getting a daypass($7) if you will use the rail/bus four or more times in a day or one can pay per trip. If you are trying to figure out your options and have a smartphone i use google maps and fill in location and destination then choose the bus icon its never failed me in greater los angeles area. In general the elapsed time using public transportation will be 2x as long as driving, however, if you are a budget traveler you will avoid parking fees (easily $15-$20/day at popular places) and the somewhat crazy slalom driving where its not unusual for a driver to swerve into your lane for no reason plus the fact los angeles now licenses illegal aliens so don't be surprised if that driver that hit you turns out to have no insurance.The train cars air conditioning system have been pretty reliable. Most of the train cars are above ground except for the red line which runs underground.There is a smartphone app 'go metro' that i use to get an idea of the next arrival time for the bus/train that is pretty accurate",Hoben01
30,Once upon a time was pleasant but has deteriorated,"My focus is on the Expo line which opened approximately two years ago. Initially, this was fabulous. Finally a way to get down to Los Angeles from Santa Monica without fighting traffic. Also very handy for the science center at USC campus. However, recently things have deteriorated. The train was never fast and it takes approximately an hour to go from Santa Monica to Los Angeles. But there are also delays. And sanitary conditions are not as good as they should be. It is all very well and good to be considered to be non-judge mental and politically correct.

We asked someone's gardener and he was happy to help us, we also asked a resident riding the metro about how to buy an all day pass. Thank you to the people of South Pasadena for showing us their Aloha. The area was quaint and there were many places to eat nearby. The metro is the only way to see downtown LA.

Surprisingly we have never seen a full load of passengers and unfortunately there were a lot of homeless people on board after 9:00 pm ; we did not feel insecure but a bit uncomfortable .",belleretraite

50,"Public transportation, the best way to get around L.A.!","Having lived on the west side for a long time and knowing shortcuts driving here and there, I can’t remember the last time I even rented a car to get around Los Angeles. Once the Metro was up and running it was the most economical way to get around. The trains and buses are the way to sightsee and get to know the social culture of Los Angeles.Instead of buying a handful of bus tokens, I decided first thing getting off the Flyaway airport bus at Union Station was to get a weeklong pass. It was $25. Considering bus fare around L.A. each way is about $1.75, you have to make sure it will pay for itself in rides because it certainly does in convenience. Between subway, bus, and walking, I knew I was going to visit several places; carrying a pocketful of quarters or tokens was not for me so putting the weeklong pass on a reusable TAP card was the convenient thing to do. The TAP card is a separate nominal charge, but they are good for a long time. They make a nice souvenir or pass it along to someone else…that’s how I originally got mine.I have to say the bus drivers were amazing…polite, considerate, helpful, and professional. It made me proud to be a Los Angeleno. What wasn’t amazing was the everyday people who didn’t respond back to the kind greetings of the bus drivers. OMG…get with it people! They are serving you, please respect them. Rudeness is never in style. I guess that goes for a lot of situations….I was staying with a friend downtown so having the TAP card was ultimately the best way for me to pay for public transportation. The only thing that was confusing was if it sufficed to pay for the Flyaway bus back to the airport. Sadly, it was not, but I could swear I read somewhere on the Metro or Flyaway website that it did. Some clarity on that would be appreciated.Enjoy your trip to L.A. and TAP away!",Sabrina N
40,Finally an alternative to the car,"Simple transport routes in L.A are a shortage, but this is a brilliant exception.Especially grateful if you are visiting the city and choose not to rent a car for your visit downtown",Phayao13
40,EXPO LINE is really worth taking,"you can get to Santa Monica from downtown LA Metro center in 45 minutes, which is as long as it will take you to drive, or maybe even less time. The Line runs veyr'frequenrtly and passes by such interesting places to visit as USC and the Museum of NaturalHistory. It is the newest of the LA METRO LINES and well worth taking.",RKZ90027
20,Need a revamp,Metro is not efficient in LA. Most of times trains are cancelled or delayed. It is a minor network. Red line is best suited for tourists.,Saurabh G
30,Efficient but stinks,"The Red Line is most convenient for tourists as it covers most tourist attractions along this line. Hollywood Vine for Pantages, Hollywood Highland for Hollywood Walk of Fame and TCL Chinese Theater where the celebrity hand and footprints are, Universal City Walk for Universal Studios, Vermont Sunset for Griffith Observatory and Union Station for airport busses and shuttle to Citadel Outlets.Unless you are covering many places in a day, it'll be cheaper to get a TAP card (stored value card - $1 for card and top up for travel. Each trip is $1.75 regardless of distance). Easily purchased via the ticketing machine. They also have a Day Pass for $7 for unlimited travel.While the trains are efficient, the seats are dirty and it stinks. Wished they did more often maintenance of the trains",dyhx
50,Got there fast.,"Quick, clean and goes where I needed to go at that time. Got a metro card and that helps in getting through quickly.",Saul F
30,Not overly useful for our stay.,"The Metro rail is decent enough if where you happen to be and want to go to somewhere that's near a stop. Often in Los Angeles this isn't the case and you are forced to take the bus or drive. If you are expecting European style public transport you will be disappointed. That said hopefully in future, the government will be able to expand it and give it more uses.",JXXXR
50,Way to avoid the traffic if it stops where your going.,"I am a senior so this only cost me $0.35 each way non rush hour so this is a real deal. I frequently go to LA Central Library and it goes within two and one half blocks so I can get there very easily.Note: Universal Studios Stop and North Hollywood stops now charge to park but at the Universal Studio stop there is free parking off Ventura about 3 blocks away. The stations do have security but I wish the trains did. I never had an issue but there are lots of people sleeping on the trains ""going nowwhere"" and they don't look good. I think the police are trying to improve this but we will see.",joellfritsche
20,Convenient but not for single ladies,"First off I'll say that the metro system functions well. The full-day pass is $8. Easy on and there are alot of connections. The stops are close to all the main attractions. The bad is that had I not been traveling with two men, I would have been terrified. On our first ride there was a passenger who was enraged at a Metro employee. He along with 4 other guys kept making threats about taking down the first person to look at them, that being after they commented on how nice one of my friends Apple watch was. The next ride had a guy who was talking to himself and who kept inching closer and closer to our party. When we finally got off, there were several vagrants lining the halls lunging out at us as we walked by. I've been on metros before in Washington DC, Seattle, and San Francisco. There is always a small amount of crazy but never did I feel as unsafe as on the LA Red Line. Fellow ladies, do not travel alone.",Amanda_Jake
50,The Only Way To Get to Downtown LA,"We rode the Metro when we went into downtown LA. It was relatively cheap, comfortable and easy to use. It saves wear and tear on your dar and on your nerves as you sit comfortably and watch the scenery go by. We bought one-way tickets in Culver City where we stayed and then added more to them for the trip back. The cars, terminals and platforms were all clean. We love public transportation since it is so easy.",Nancy F
50,Efficient and fast way to go to downtown,"This was my first time to ride on the Metro in Los Angeles. I never imagined that the Metro would work in Los Angeles. However, I was pleasantly surprised that $1.75 a ride got me to downtown Los Angeles from Hollywood and Highland faster than driving. It felt is was less than 20min.I think the LAX line is currently being worked on and that would be even more convenient to get to LAX from downtown Los Angeles. I highly recommend anyone who wants to get to places near the metro line fast and inexpensively.",Gkitazum
50,"The Weekend Day Pass for ""Locals"" and Visitors from Riverside or anywhere to everywhere!","For 20 bucks you got two tickets to paradise. Or just you for ten. OK, maybe it's not paradise, but it's pretty good. It's LA, Hollywood, museums, shopping, a trip up Angel's Flight, Old Town Pasadena, Orange, San Juan Capistrano from Oceanside to Ventura, Long Beach, or Exposition Park. For 10 bucks all day long on a weekend (good for the one day you purchase it) and it includes busses, subways, light rail. Not Amtrak, but it's a great deal.We live in Riverside, CA - about an hour's drive west of Los Angeles... on a good day. That's been known to stretch to 3 hours on any given day for a variety of reasons.About a year ago, we ""discovered"" this deal that's been great for us, but would also be wonderful even if you're a visitor staying in any outlying city connected by Metrorail.We get up, park for free in a secure lot, buy the ticket at a kiosk, hop the train with a coffee and newspaper, grab a table on the top tier and enjoy the ride - and the view. What a different view.Examples of our trips: Metrolink to Metrorail subway to Hollywood and Vine, the station itself is a work of art and worth the trip for it's own sake - brunch at ""Off Vine"" - Walk of Stars, back to Pershing Square, Up Angel's Flight (fifty cents), bus to the Bradbury Building and then Chinatown, Gold line back to Union Station, Metrolink back to Riverside. 10 bucks.Riv. to Union Station, Redline subway to Hollyood and Highland, Grauman's (now renamed something else) Chinese Theater, bus to the original Farmer's Market at the Grove for lunch, bus to the Peterson Auto Museum at Fairfax and Wilshire (ground floor's 10 or so cars for free is worth going in) across the street to the LACM of Art - even the outside exhibit(s) Urban Lights - is something to see. The La Brea Tar Pits are literally right next door. CA teachers are free fyi. Bus back to the Purple line subway (it doesn't - yet - reach all the way out Wilshire - the ""Miracle Mile"") to Union Station, to Riverside.Another day we went south, brunch in the Orange Circle, onward to San Juan Capistrano and Oceanside pier and back that evening. $10 ea. Enjoy the ride - it's right along the ocean in parts, through desolation othertimes - a completely different perspective on the lay of the land from the usual freeway.To Pasadena or Griffith Park (that one's an additional... fifty cents? on the DASH)Look, if you're not taking advantage of this deal, you're missin' out - visiting the area or living here - you could even visit Riverside which has it's cool things. But we've are here done that and so now we ride the rails.

A short 30 minute ride gets me to 7th Street Metro Center, where I transfer (free) to the Red or Purple line toward Union Station, but get off at Civic Center. From there, it's a two block walk to Disney Hall. The cars are generally clean, and the ride gives you a view of the city that you don't get from a freeway. Plus, you avoid the traffic and parking fees downtown!In a couple of years, my ride will get even better, as the Crenshaw line will come within a mile of my house, and the Regional Connector will include a station right behind Disney Hall without the transfer at Metro Center.",novagarde

40,Check the Metro out for the architecture!,"While we usually evaluate metro systems in terms of their ability to get us around the city, you might check out the LA system for its design features. I went on a tour of some of the metro stops and was very impressed by the design thought that was put into it. For example, one site - near the classic ""hollywood"" area - has a ceiling surface composed of movie reels! The central Union Station is a beautifully restored example of elegant art deco, evocative of the era when young fledging actors might arrive on the 20th Century Limited to make their careers in Hollywood...I did not ride the system during the night or to all locations but within the general downtown area I found it to be on par with metro systems in other American and European cites, possibly even more ADA compliant and modern because it is a relatively new system. If you're doing a lot of travel by subway, it is worth getting a day pass. The system is supplemented by various bus systems.

10,LA Metro is the absolute worst.,"You wrote a review for South Pasadena Gold Line Station 4 minutes ago1.0 star rating 10/12/2017Let's see... where do I begin....The LA Metro Transit system is THE ABSOLUTE WORST. Goldline, Red line, Explo Line, Blue Line -- All the lines.Unlike the rest of their world, their constantly broken down trains and rail lines arrive every 20 minutes or so morning, day and night -- unlike their advertised 5 minute transit arrival times.On top of arriving late every day, they shorten the train by 2 cars so you are ABSOLUTELY JAMMED & CRAMMED ON THE TRAIN with other people.The drivers love to slam on the breaks.People are smoking blunts on the goldline and redline like it's a full time job. The police do absolutely nothing about it. Even amidst the complaints. But why would they? Theyre paid a time and half to sustain the most mundane job on the planet. They just don't care..Don't bother downloading the METRO app because the arrival times are never accurate. NEVER.Elevators and escalators are always broken down. It's a joke. So instead they request handicapped people take bus lines miles away from the train station.People piss all over the platforms and it stinks. It's really sad... and disgusting.On average, I nearly get into work late 3 times a week. I've had to add an extra 45 minutes of travel time to my morning schedule because of Metro.Again, The LA METRO is the absolute worst public transit system in the world. 3rd world countries have a more efficient public transit system than we do.With all that said.... Traveling around town? Get an uber!!!!!",christelcollabos

50,"Designed with ""Civics"" in mind...","One thing I can say about the LA Metro... it was definitely designed to move people to and from certain civic institutions like the COURTS and the JAILS. This can come in handy for those who have to do their civil duty such as appearing before a judge and especially the dreaded JURY DUTY! Even the courthouse all the way out in East LA is within reach of the MIGHTY METRO! Taking the train/subway system was one of the brighter parts of a recent call to jury duty and it can be a pleasant experience if you go to the Metro website and familiarize yourself with it. Well kept, clean and very much on time, the Metro Rail can take you to places you never knew about. As a result, I now have a new favorite burger joint that I go to whenever I have that craving and it's only a Metro Rail ride away! Not nearly as many weirdos and with no constant stink of pee like the subway in New York, the Metro Rail is definitely the answer for relaxing weekend travel if you're burned out from your regular car commute. ALSO, in the very near future, the Metro PURPLE LINE will be going all the way from Union Station to Santa Monica! DA BEACH, MON! So, take a trip without the stress... Metro Rail is pretty awesome.",egtact
40,A Civilized Option to Torturous LA Traffic,"I'm an LA native, born in the 50's before the horrible traffic in the old days when we had good public transportation. For the past 5 1/2 years my wife and I have used the Metro Red Line to commute to our downtown LA office. Driving the 11 miles from our home near Universal Studios to our office averaged 45 minutes and coming home was about an hour and often longer. It's not just the time on the freeways and streets, it's the dehumanizing effects of the traffic.In addition to commuting, we use the train when we go to the Hollywood Bowl or to go out in Hollywood, Santa Monica or DTLA. So, here are some tips based on over 1000 rides:1. You must actually pay to ride Metro. Buy a Tap card for $1 at any station and load your fare. Pay attention to the fare costs. Many people buy all day passes only to find out that it may be cheaper to buy a an amount that is reduced each time you tap. Find what your cost is per ride and do the math. Note, if you are 62 or older be sure to buy senior fare as it is way cheaper. Be sure to have ID to prove your age. Men and women with badges and guns may check to see if you have paid for your rides.2. There is now a charge to park at the Universal station. It is $3 per day and you must have a Tap Card to charge it and you must Tap your card in the station. The system notes you car license plate and your Tap card number. If you pay $3 and don't Tap in the station, you can expect to make a $53 donation to LA County. This was implemented because too many tourists were parking at the Metro lot and going to Universal.3. You can download the Metro schedules and keep them on your smart phone.4. There are some hubs for the system.The first and smallest is Wilshire/Vermont where both the Red and Purple lines meet. The Purple line only currently goes to Wilshire/Western, in the heart of K-Town. BUT that stop is where you are just across the street from the Wiltern Theater for you music folks.The next hub is 7th Street Metro. Both the Red and Purple lines stop there en route to their final stop at Union Station. 7th is a great spot to start exploring some of DTLA's restaurants and bars. There you can switch to the Blue line train to Long Beach (be aware that it transitions some rough parts of town) and to the Expo line that can take you all the way to the Santa Monica pier.The last hub that I know and rarely go to is Union Station where you can find Amtrak, Metro Link and the Gold line that goes to Chinatown, Pasadena and beyond to Azusa.5. SAFETY.....Like anywhere else, you must be careful on the trains. Be aware of who is around you and who boards at each stop. Also, be aware that there really is not much law enforcement presence, especially on the trains. If you are not comfortable in a car, you can rush to change cars at the next station, but you don't have much time. We've taken the train late and never had a problem from the bigger stations like 7th or Hollywood Highland, but have chosen to take Uber or Lyft instead.",powerharp

My nearest station was Pershing Square. The main entrance on the square seemed to be a meeting place for homeless people which can be a bit intimidating but I had no problems. There are a few other exits from the station but you do need to know where you are going to ensure you use the right exit. I didn't and got lost.",Iain M

The trains themselves were okay but maybe a taxi would have been less traumatic for this anxious traveller (my hotel offered a flat fare of $20 to get to studio). The metro each way was, I think, seven or eight dollars.",Pixiehat
20,A POOR EXCUSE FOR A SUBWAY.,"The Los Angeles metro is only a few years old, but it is so dirty and used that it feels older than the New York subway or the London tube. Service is poor. Trains arrive every 15 or 20 minutes usually, but are often broken down and so you can wait in a station for much, much longer. Once, while trying to get to a show at the Hollywood bowl for which I had tickets the train never came and I missed the show. THIS IS ALWAYS A RISK WHEN TAKING THE LA SUBWAY! Escalators are usually broken down, so prepare to climb stairs (lots of them). And when the escalator is working Los Angeles people seem oblivious to the universally accepted concept of standing to the right so that others can walk up the moving escalator on the left. Ticket purchase is much more confusing from the ticket machines than in cities like New York or Chicago or London. Many of the stations have inadequate parking and paying for parking is even more complicated. Some of the routes such as Orange and Silver lines are actually buses, not rail at all. And the worst thing about the system is: the stations are poorly located! There is NO STATION at LAX, the airport. There are no stations at Dodger Stadium, Westwood, Venice, Glendale, Burbank or Century City, all obvious locations where public transportation is needed. When I take the Red Line to the Hollywood Bowl I still need to walk about a mile up a hill from the station. The newest line is the Exposition Line, which goes from downtown to Santa Monica, but for which they didn't even bother to buy new rolling stock, so they are using nasty old junky cars that they took from the Blue Line. Oh, and don't take the Blue line unless you are in no hurry at all to get to Long Beach. You can probably walk it faster. I could say much more, but if you don;t believe me, check it out for yourself.",Warren M
50,Great cheap mode of transportation!,I've used the metro line once both time I visited Noho. It cost $3 to park all day and only $1.75 each way. Not having to drive in the insane LA traffic and not having to pay upwards of $15 to park makes taking the metro such a great option. Driving from Noho to the History Museum was about 30 minutes of craziness when we should have just taken the train (husband wanted to drive. Never again he said!)

There aren’t as many people using it so I don’t have to worry about the crowds that somewhere like NYC has, which makes it easier to maintain everything also. I’m looking forward to this system getting expanded further so that it goes to more stops and I can use it more often.",Colby S

40,Suprised how good an experince it was.,"Think of the Metro you think of homeless, druggies, beggars. We did not see any and had several conversations with other people on the Metro. People in jeans and T-shirts to full business attire, all there to get from one place to another for a fair price. Everything was clean and navigating to our destination was simple even with a few transfers. Fill up your TAP card when you start or at every time you need to pay, machines are fairly easy to understand. If you are a senior it seems almost free, like $0.35 If I remember right. We will use the Metro more often from now on.",Tim L

50,Very Convenient. Quick and Clean way to travel in Los Angeles,"You have to know the system of the Red, Blue and Green lines and know how they work. Most passengers and staff at the station are very helpful. Saves gas, time and aggravation driving on LA freeways. Take Uber to where you want to go once you get off at the correct station or walk. The network does not cover all areas of Los Angeles but most touristy hubs are covered from where you can do Uber to go to a local attraction.",realtorPebble

40,Metro Rail LA Continues Valuable Improvements As Service Expands Throughout the City,"Metro Rail in LA is expanding across the city at increasing rates thanks in large part to Measure M recently passed in LA and in response to preparations for the 2024 Olympics awarded to the city. As services expands, cleaner, safer, and better monitored lines offer regular daily customers and casual travelers alike a better commute and travel experience than ever before. The Metro Rail trains are timely, safe, and efficient means of getting from point A to point B in the city. As service increases in the months and years ahead, it will be difficult to find a better option for local travel in SoCal. Even now, the automobile traffic in the LA basin is so onerous that Metro Rail is already the best option available to many daily commuters and the businesses they currently serve.",iimrich

50,Love seeing the trains back in LA!!!!,But whoi ever designed these forgot the stop maps in the trauibns..on the wall of the cars! and i could not find a map to take with me anywhere! i know it is on line...that is NO excuse! But they are fast quiet and clean!!! A bit overpriced if these are really supposed to get all those nutty cars off the freeway however! And shutting down to the sunday schedule on a holiday? (Labour Day) seems a bit odd...Europe doesnt shut down on holidays as they know people want to travel even more!,Artisteyes

Went down town..took about 20 minutes....and came back during rush hour. It was crowded, but people were patient. The Best was...I was back OUT OF RUSH hour in 20 minutes! That would have taken an hour by car. I would give it 5 stars, but wished there were some eateries inside the tubes. No such luck...",405kareni
40,Worth it just to see this side of DTLA!,"I went on the Metro Rail in May and was happily surprised. I admit it: the transport itself was kind of gross (dirty, smelly, dingy lighting), the overall experience of traveling via ...dare I say ... subway? lol ... was exciting and new. (Sorry, I'm a Manhattanite; I feel like I'm cheating by saying ""subway"" for an LA-based system).What I really like and do recommend, cost, simplicity and speed of use aside, is the opportunity to view the buildings themselves. They are historical and very artsy.I recommend everyone try this at least once; and for those of you who use the MR regularly to commute, I applaud you! I'm all for lessening my carbon stiletto footprint; I will try to take advantage of this mode of transportation more often from now on. (Just as long as we are not in a severe heat wave.... 108 degree temps aren't fun.)P.S. It would also be nice if the Metro Rail system had bathrooms installed, but I guess that's not a regular occurrence on subways. Still, it's a nice feature to have. Oh, THAT and SEAT BELTS would be really nice. These machines FLY along when they get going.",Rebecca S
50,Very clean and efficient.,I especially use it when going from the West Valley to Hollywood and Long Beach.Fare is very cheap considering the fact that gas prices will be going up.,rbonassi
50,Cheap way to get around,The Metro was convenient and fast and very reasonable. Clean and staff very friendly and willing to help. Would suggest this means of transportation then the hop on hop off which was expensive and had no designated areas of stop. Seems that everyday they changed the pick up and drop off points. Long waits and numerous drivers were rude and not friendly. Take the metro and save money and time,6422016
30,"""Tap"" Card","LA is not known for it's public transportation system and it has a way to go but hopefully the upcoming Olympics will prompt further investment - greater LA covers a large geographic area and getting around is time consuming, even by car.The good: the trains are reasonably clean and appear to have police and Metro staff on hand to promote safety on the system. Did discover some cool artwork in 7th St/Metro Center station, an unexpected bonus.The bad: service is a bit ""spotty,"" possibly because of weekend engineering works; direct connection to LAX is not yet there like they have done in Chicago, St Louis and Seattle, to name a few cities that have this in place; connecting from Metro or municipal (""Muni"") buses is confusing as the systems are not integrated like (e.g.) London where you can use the one transport card for everything - transfers need to be purchased separately and in some cases, paid for in cash as they can't take it out of the balance on the Tap card.",DABSMO
50,Art Tour,Metro Rail has docents that provide a tour of the art in various stations that is fun as well as informative. They have standing schedules but you can get a private tour for a group of 10 or more.,Rea C
50,Really good,Lets face it LA is a difficult place to get around. All the locals drive but traffic is disgustingly bad. Driving is cheap for tourists - its easy to rent a car and there is lots of usually free parking BUT you have to sit in traffic.The metro is relatively new to LA and in comparison to European cities and other US cities like New York or DC this is very under used and even clean.Both the stations and trains have plenty of space.This had made me visit places in greater LA that previously I removed from my must see list as I couldn't face the car journey.If riding Metrolink into LA you can get metro travel included for free on your Metrolink ticket.,Torlus
40,First-rate system,"Cleaner, quieter, newer, and more user-friendly than the NYC subway, definitely a more relaxing way to get around LA than driving on the freeways, if you’re heading someplace where it goes.

30,Depends on where you are going,"LA has some terrible traffic and you would think a great Metro would be an answer, unfortunately not. It is old (subway carriages 30 years old) and above ground metro whilst newer is slow (we took the Blue line to Long beach) at 90 minutes, or double the driving time. It doesn't seem to get priority at intersections and was always stopping. Some unsavoury characters on the Metro also so take care. Our trip was great as a one off (used Uber instead) and other lines are likely faster.",Grommet22
50,Santa Monica to LA,"OK, parking is no fun, so take the Metro. It is fast, $1.75 each way and you don't have to drive. We stayed in Santa Monica and went into LA for the day.

ASK at the Front Desk to see if anyone has left TAP cards.",MettaMoon
50,Great value for money,"If you're staying in Downtown LA and want to visit Hollywood, Santa Monica or Long Beach then the Metro Rail service offers great value for money at just $3.50 return.

30,Word to the wise!,The metro Rail takes you to some very nice and exciting places but you will need to bring a personal protective device due to some rather unsavory characters that are currently riding the rails. Its a great way to get around town just stay alert on the trains and busses,William A
40,Clean and well patrolled,"Compared to some other large city underground rail systems this is better than most. While it depends on the time of day and the area, it is usually patrolled by police who keep the street people moving and I was never hassled by anyone while waiting or riding aboard a train. You will need to buy a TAP card for $1.00 but that can be used over and over like a debit card that you recharge before entering the platform. It is definitely the leas expensive and fastest way to get from point to point. IT is worth a short walk if you need to get there or reach your final destination. It also ties into the surface bus system so that you can reach nearly anywhere you need with a little patience. Not as good as the Paris rail but not bad either.",Steve S

I didn't give a perfect rating because the Red/Purple Line cars really could use a deep cleaning. I still ride on them though, and use sanitizing wipes accordingly!

It was hot below ground and the train took about 8 minutes to arrive from when we began waiting, but it was fairly clean when it arrived and actually felt very similar to any train you might take in NYC. For those people who may be reluctant like me, I recommend taking it with the caveat that if you are a woman, you might not want to take it alone after dark. Overall, Metro Rail seems fairly efficient and not too dirty or off-putting.",Melissa D

50,What a brilliant metro system,Loved it and used it a lot during our visit as we didn't want to drive as the traffic jams are all day in and around LA.bought a week pass for $25 which can be used as often as you like and whatever time you like. The metro doesn't go everywhere in LA but covers a lot of areas and if not it will get you to a bus stop stop which will get you there.,evag385
40,A good system if it goes where you need it to!!!,"The LA Metro goes against the very grain of the Southern California car culture and for that alone it deserves high marks. The problem is that there are many times it either doesn't go where you need it to (HELLO LAX) or that you have to walk a long ways upon departure from the Metro to get to wear you're going. With a little planning and luck it's a great, clean and safe way to travel.",Mark J
50,Traveling carnival,"The Metro is a great way to get around LA, and when you get a TAP card it's a great deal. We traveled mostly on the Red and Expo lines, from Hollywood to downtown and from Santa Monica to Hollywood. The cast of characters is interesting, especially at night, from the lady who jumped up and began some kind of whirling dervish dance to the man who came stomping through our car talking to God knows who. Not to mention several people who slept the whole time (homeless?). The Red Line travels much faster than the Expo, because it is entirely underground; the Expo is mostly above ground and for that reason has to slow down, if not come to a complete stop, because of crossing traffic All in all it sure beats driving!.",David A

If you're flying in to LAX, you can catch the bus marked ""Green Line"" which will take you for free to the nearest Mtero Rail station. If you come by train, you will arrive at Union Station, which is a stop on the ""Red Line.""

For the past two years, Metro has had a Day of the Dead Art Tour, which featured renowned Day of the Dead altar artist Consuelo Flores beginning the tour with free face painting for interested passengers, a free day-pass, and Ms. Flores' expert and fascinating guided tour of the amazing public artwork at several of the stations.

40,super convenienotvway to get to downtown,"I didn't think that LA had a metro, but it does.For a city built as an homage to the motorcar, it seems an odd juxtaposition, a contravention of the stereotype, as the terms car and LA sit right beside one another in our mental map of the world. LA has been designed around the car. And some cars have been designed with LA in mind too.So it's refreshing to find that they have built a metro. It's pretty skeletal by comparison with other cities and given the vast floorplan of LA, but if you have access to it, it's quite brilliant.We took the line from Expo & Bundy to go downtown. Forty minutes, loads of convenient parking right by the station on Olympic, it couldn't have been easier. And on the way, you get a good sense of LA's streetscapes and maybe more down to earth communities. It's not all about Hollywood around here.And on another note, the much maligned downtown is really well worth a visit. Unlike many U.S. cities the downtown area has not been substantially rebuilt, so much of it is as it was in its 30's -50's heyday. Its worn, threadbare and dusty in many parts, but is a real good school day. Best not to stay wandering there after dark maybe, but safe as houses and great fun in the day.And the metro line is the way to go We could see i10 completely snarled up as we rumbled along And watch for the Hollywood sign way away in the distance.

Most uncomfortable seats ever-- I think I have sciatic nerve damage from the hard, unpadded seats and the long ride in uncomfortable position. Metro guards ignore the screaming crazies pounding on the seats and cursing, nobody checks for swiping TAP card when transferring or boarding, the homeless just ride around all day. Illegal vendors on every car, rampant eating, drinking, and trash everywhere. But at least it gets you to within a block of 3rd Street Promenade OK and The Place shopping center but not very close to Main Street shops and restaurants, about a 3/4 mile walk. Goes right by the Natural History Museum and USC, close to Coliseum. Some new cars have a handy screen showing next few stops, nice, but most cars do not. Pretty low class way to travel, glad I don't have to take it. Please spend the money to speed up the freeways, and ditch the Metro.",ANonyMouse45
20,Scheduling terrible,"I have used metro over the years. The route gets you long distances like to long beach, which is great if you don't want to go very far from the stations. But when I went to go from highland park to upland, just over border of Los Angeles County, I found I couldn't get further than citrus college area, not the Eastern county edge. also after arranging a ride from there to upland, a good distance, miles, I learned the line shutdown from 3 or 4 pm to or pm. It was at least a 4 hour window. In the morning the train was every 20 Minutes. Go figure.",Molly H

Liked it a lot.",Me_n_my_rucksack
40,What a great way to get around LA,"I purchased a TAP card in advance, but I could have easily gotten one at the metro kiosk. The card is easy to load and you just use the card at each station before getting on a train or when you transfer. I used the rail system to got to Santa Monica and to Long Beach.

Would definitely do this again.",Busyworkingmom3
50,Accessibility using wheelchair,On vacation in LA and as wheelchair user I really must commend Los Angeles on their excellent accessible transport system. Indeed I must say I have found LA to have an exceptionally accessible street and transport system. The platform and trains are at the same level pretty much and the gap between platform and train is very small so unlikely to trap wheels as I have experienced for example in London. Most platforms have a yellow box area which positions the wheeler at a train door with a wheelchair space. The station staff have been very helpful in explaining both location of elevators and use of tickets. I also found fellow travellers respectful and helpful. WELL DONE LA,2020Heather
40,The view is quite special,If you want to relax and get to San Diego from LA without the stress of driving then the train is perfect.

20,One of the worst rapid transit systems in the county,"The Los Angeles metro system is slow, hard to understand, and underdeveloped. Stations are grimy and do not have restrooms. The TAP system is confusing, especially for folks from out of town. Additionally, they do not have enough TAP scanners at stations. For a city the size of LA, they should have double the number of lines and stations as well as more frequent trains. Ridership would probably increase if the number of destinations increased.",Jared N

TAP cards can be purchased at the electronic vending machines at the stations, and loaded with cash at the same time. Journey prices are very cheap and the trains and stations are very clean. Trains run on time and frequently. Stations are located around the city and especially accessible in most of the tourist areas. Highly recommended.",TravellingManOz
50,Extensive,An extensive rail system that proves reliable and cheap when we stayed just outside of the city. Very good,JasonDoz
30,In Some Ways This Can Be A Bizarre Experience,"The LA rail system has been expanded and continues to be as I write this. So now you can get to more places by rail than before. The big problem is that the infrastructure and operating bureaucracy still leave a lot to be desired. Trains frequently run with delays, some extreme. Most of these are probably because of some police or medical emergency in a station or on a train. Some issues are mechanical or construction related. Though there might be announcements from time to time and even a station agent on hand, the information you're given at the time could be wrong. Also, the train you've chosen to take because both the signage and track location agree to indicate your destination, might not actually go there. And the electric digital signboards with information on next arrivals and tracks can be wrong. So wrong I found that one of the displays was jammed back several weeks. So if you're from a third world or lower country, you know what to expect. But if you really need to get to a place within a reasonable window of time, maybe try Uber or Lyft. You really need patience and a sense of ongoing futility to put your travel faith into this rail system.",Zoom_Gotti
50,Los Angeles the Second Time Around,"In December 1995, I visited Southern California, rented a car, and stayed in a hotel in Anaheim. During my stay there, I took different bus tours to Los Angeles County, Orange County, and San Diego. While I enjoyed the sights, I was also disappointed in the lack of public transportation.Since then, I learned about how much the transit has improved in LA, and I studied the LA Metro.I'm no stranger to public transit: I have traveled on different transit lines in North America and Europe. Therefore, when I visited in December 2015, I stayed at the Metro Plaza Hotel, a few blocks from Union Station. Nevertheless, staying within a few blocks of almost any metro station will open up your traveling options.Anyway, I bought a weekly Tap Card for $25 the day I arrived. This card is good for unlimited travel for LA's Metro, light rail, and most of their busses.On the other hand, the Tap Card didn't include the following: Culver City Buses, the DASH (Downtown Area Short Hop) Buses, and the Pasadena ARTS (Area Rapid Transit Service) Busses, but the base fares for those transit systems were much cheaper compared to transit fares in NYC, Philly, and DC.I found the stations clean, the trains were efficient, and tapping the Tap Card at the turnstile or post to ride the subway or light rail was much better than NYC's system of swiping the MetroCard. You also didn't have to have the Tap Card to exit--unlike Washington, DC's Metro Cards. Thus, I traveled to different parts of Downtown LA, Hollywood, Culver City, Burbank, and Pasadena via Metro, light rail, or bus--or all three. I never used a taxi or rented a car!I especially found the Hollywood and Highland Station impressive with its stainless-steel futuristic look, and the Hollywood and Vine Station presented a show-biz decor with film reels in the ceiling at the train platform. Upstairs, I saw a display of a film projector and camera, and the overall interior looked like the inside of an old-time cinema.Now to the minuses: LA's Metro doesn't run 24/7 like the NYC Subway, and I doubt if it will ever be a extensive as NYC's transit system, but it's a vase improvement over 20 years ago.For more information call the MTA/LA at 800-266-6883 or Google ""Metro Los Angeles.""",Dotty K

50,Car-free in the Car Capital!,"Metro Rail is so underrated. Los Angeles is in the process of creating the most modern and the most ambitious transit system in the country - second only to New York. We're not there yet, but it's exciting to ride the subway (yes, there is a subway in LA and it's fast, fun and beats driving) and the light rail (lines going to the beach, the Valley, Pasadena, Long Beach and more). At $1.75 a ride (with free transfers to other systems and to buses and unlimited distance) and for only $7 a day for an unlimited pass, it's also inexpensive. HIGHLY RECOMMEND USING THIS SYSTEM!",Aaron P
40,Best way to travel in the city,"As a tourist to Los Angeles, go for the public transportation system, especially Metro subway. First start, by a day pass card (the first time is $8 because one dollar goes to the card) and when you refill, it is 7. You don't know how to do it, ask attendance(s) who are always available to help you with the purchase (they stand around at major station to assist people like me who looks lost). You can use the pass with Metro and buses. (It is worth the money because each one way trip will cost you at least $1.75. You can use it from the airport, go to Hollywood, go to Santa Monica Beach, or even to Long Beach if you have time. Get you pass, tap the machine to go in, and most places you do not have to tap to get out. Be a ware that, at certain station (like Santa Monica, there might be a police to check if you have pass and if you tap to get in). Otherwise, best way to travel around Los Angeles.",Prawet J
30,Subway 101,"We use the Metro quite a bit. Lately there has been a rise in the number of people hustling money on the trains themselves, but they tend to be brief and non-aggressive. It's not uncommon to see people collecting around the stations on the street level, however they generally do not interact with riders, and there is a visible security presence where this tends to happen.Station stops are really short, and seats become scarce on some lines around commute times. Luckily, the trips are fairly short between stops and seats open up often.Trains are well worn and some are downright shabby, the stations are adequately lit, but not bright. I have not seen restrooms at any of the stations (evidenced by the overpowering small of urine in the elevators). LA Union Station is the hub, and has the most resources for riders - including ticketing for the Metolink heavy rail trains that serve the greater southern California communities. Seventh and Metro is also a link between lines, I have not seen any rider conveniences other than escalators at this station.The convenience and economy provided by the Metro is well worth the downside associated with public transportation. The trains run late into the evening and start very early in the morning. The lines serve most of the high demand destinations of Los Angeles - but getting to LAX is better on the Flyaway Bus until the subway can be extended into the airport.Riders often have bikes or luggage or strollers, so the floor can get crowed just in front of the exit doors on the trains.Expect the down escalators (and sometimes the up escalators) to be out of service. Expect a wait to access the TAP vending machines that vend a number of fare combinations as well and a reusable card (it takes an endless number of button pushes to accomplish a transaction).All in all, it is a safe economic and efficient way to miss the traffic and reach a wide variety of Los Angeles destinations. It's just not flashy.",John C

50,Great Experience Using Metro Rail in LA,I'm one of those persons wedded to my car whenever I go into LA - but given all of the hassles of finding parking for a USC football game at the Coliseum used the Metro from Union Station after reading up on it a bit.Found:1. Easy and inexpensive parking at Union Station2. A number of Metro employees there to explain ticketing system and options3. Lots of trains running at short intervals4.

50,Great for Locals Great for Tourists,"I live in Los Angeles and I ride Metro Rail on a regular basis. It's a great boon for locals and an excellent way to get around the city if you're a tourist. It's the best way to avoid using a car and putting up with traffic. If you are a local you probably know how to ride the Metro Rail, but if you're a tourist you might want to know how it works before arriving in L.A. There are various lines that serve different parts of the city and these are named with colors: Red Line, Gold Line, Orange Line, etc.At each station there are maps of the system that tell you how to get to your destination. The Metro Rail is both above ground and underground. To ride, you do not purchase paper tickets at the stations, rather you buy a plastic ""tap card"" for a dollar and then electronically load it with sufficient money to buy your ride.(There is also a bargain all day fare you can buy.) You do this by inserting your money and then passing the tap card over the screen to record how much money you have loaded for fares.Each time you want to board a train you pass your card over one of the ""posts"" that say ""tap here"" and the correct fare is deducted from your card. If you are continuing onto another line you may not be charged but the word ""transfer"" will appear on the screen of the post. Every time you pass your tap card over the round screen on the post money will be deducted from your card. Your tap card is also good for buses in the L.A. system. Riding Metro Rail and buses is a safe and convenient way to all around the city and is certainly a bargain!",bleeson8
40,"A Basic, Excellent Ride Service","The metro rail system in Los Angeles I think is excellent. I won't say it's fantastic or phenomenal. But then, is any public transportation system so? It's the subway. It's a train transportation service. And in most my experiences traveling on it, it's on time and wastes no time getting you from one location to the next. If I have an objection, I wish the depots or train centers provided water fountains and vending machines. But I can understand why they don't. The seating on the trains are comfortable enough, for we're talking functionality and utilitarianism here. Not luxury or amenity. The Metro Rail subway is an excellent ride service.

And to be quite frank, some of the stations you simply don't feel safe in as a woman. I think having this ""honor system"" here in L.A. is the biggest joke!!! Any idiot can get on the trains...and they do!!! Some stations have little turn pikes now...well, they're about hip-high, and people can just jump over them. I've had a number of uncomfortable encounters in stations and on trains...and I do mean in the middle of the day, therefor I decided I'm better off driving myself. They should really consider having Metro officers inside all of the stations, or they should do what many other cities do...put a donut shop, or a coffee shop, or a newspaper stand inside the stations...that way there are people and there is activity, and women don't have to feel uncomfortable or downright scared when going in and out of a Metro station.",Tina C

Plus, the platform area for each stop is well kept and clean, the ticket vending machines always work, and each station's message clock is always working. So it's like I said at the beginning.

You may not always get seating during peak hours, but is never fully packed.Make sure you always load and tap your card as there is checking and the fines are hefty.

Hollywood, Downtown and Santa Monica are now all connected. The trains are nice and clean and you can use your TAP card to transfer to city buses. LAX TIP: While Metro Rail doesn't connect directly to LAX just yet, you can take a short bus ride from the terminal to the green line station, Aviation/LAX. Take the green line six stops and transfer to the blue line, which takes you to Downtown LA. It's only $1.75 (plus $2 for a reloadable TAP card), which is ridiculously cheap compared to cabs and buses.",John L

50,Los Angeles' subway system is the only mode of public transportation that works in the city,"After quelling Angelenos' fears of being killed inside a subway tunnel--brought on by Universal Studios' tram tour which for decades has simulated a disastrous earthquake hitting the San Francisco BART system--the MTA has gained the trust of the populace, and the result is an ever-expanding subway system. Many Angelenos are oblivious to the Metro Rail's existence, however they shouldn't be. With reliable schedules and fast travel between Downtown Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley, the MTA has kept its promise to the people of L.A. for safe and affordable rail travel. The downside is that there isn't enough rail in this traffic-choked city. Expansions to LAX and the West Side will take several years.",Aaron P

It may not be as efficient as New York's subway or the Washington DC Metro system, but one can get to most places in the greater L.A. area using a combination of rail and bus. Fares are relatively cheap at $1.75 or $.75 for Seniors and you can buy an all day pass that's even more economical. Better yet, if you travel on Metrolink, you can use nearly all of the Metro system for free! My wife and I recently rode Metrolink from the City of Industry to L.A. Union Station and then rode Metrorail all the way to Santa Monica. The station is just two or three blocks from the Santa Monica Pier and right across the street from the 3rd St. Promenade. On our trip back, we got off in downtown L.A., strolled around and picked up a DASH bus to take us to Philippe's Restaurant. After that, we walked to Olvera Street and back to Union Station for the ride home. Total cost was just a Metrolink Sr. fare of $8.50. All in all a great and inexpensive day trip.",IrishRick

Be aware the system is slow and colourful characters use the cheap travel too.

30,The trains themselves are great but the system...,"In order to ride you have to use a tap (TAP?) card. There are machines at each station where you can load your cards for various amounts and here's where the trouble starts:- TWICE machines haven't read my cards to pay. First at the Hollywood/Highland station in April '16 and then in June '16 at the 17th St Station.- I have put money on cards that ""expired"" within weeks or days. I put money on my card prior to a planned trip to the beach. When I checked my card on my return trip it said that I had a balance of $5. I used $1.75 for the trip back so I should have had $3.25 remaining. When I tried to use a bus two days later, the driver said that I owed money which didn't make sense since the ride was $1.75.- On Friday, July 1 around 11:15, the Expo line was 20 minutes late and the train was packed. What made it frustrating is that at the station, the electric signs didn't give notice of this in advance.Otherwise, it's a pleasure to get off work and take the train to the beach for a couple of hours. It's a great way to get to the beach and it's a short walk to the beach from the station. I live in West Hollywood so there's no station close by, but there's one close to my work. I look forward to taking it downtown to concert and such.",HowardBanister2015

Then easily take the metro to see the Hollywood sights.

40,Pleasantly Surprised,"I didn't know what to expect when I took the metro rail for the first time, but I must say it exceeded my expectations. First of all, it's very clean. You're not allowed to take any food or beverages, and that probably has helped to maintain it. Secondly, it was air-conditioned so it was comfortably. I have taken the trains quite a bit now, primarily to touristy spots (to take friends) such as Olvera St. Plaza, Chinatown, Hollywood, and even Downtown. The trains were always on time; they pass by often, and overall it was a very positive experience. The only thing is that as it gets darker you get some unusual characters, but I never felt unsafe. They have a daily and monthly pass, but I don't think they have a weekly pass which would be ideal, particularly for people who come on vacation. the only downside is that I wish it would go to more places; however, having said that you can definitely get around and hit most of the top spots.

40,Getting around Los Angeles,"The LA Metro was the best way to see some of the main attractions in the area. Although it does not completely cover this vast city it is very efficient. The signage is good and service runs. Regularly, as it's not finished it links in with bus services to cover the whole area. It's relatively cheap too, we got a day ticket so you can go anywhere on bus or train. First you need to buy a tap card, we got ours from the desk in the main station ( Union Station), then you keep that card and load it up with money at any of the machines you find at each stop. There are security people around who check everyone has got a card, once you have it you use it to enter each station or stop. We picked up timetables and a map of the routes and we were off. Used it to visit museums mostly and the stops were very close to them.

20,Can be Dangerous depending on when you travel,"For my friends coming from overseas this is not your typical monitored clean rail system. This is a dangerous system late at night and sometimes on the weekends as it attracts a savory lot of folks that use it for purposes other then basic transportation. During the weekday it is a decent system to use but be warned that it is crowded in sections and it is not monitored very well by the LAPD or the transit police. Also during certain times it can be difficult to get from point A to point B as this system does not do a very good job of coordinating themselves with other forms of transportation and waiting times can vary depending on the time and line. Anyone wanting to us this from the airport would be better off using a shuttle, as you would need to take a bus to the Green Line Station and then depending on where you were traveling too would have to transfer possibly several times.",heumanntouch
10,avoid the Metro Silver line,"Touted as a premium ride, comparable to the light rail lines, this is in fact a poor excuse for an express bus line. One can wait for half an hour listening to the expressway traffic whiz by, get on a barely standing room only bus, only to see another Silver Line bus right behind. These are poorly maintained, rattling your bones even when just idling, nearly impossible to tolerate when on the highway. Shock absorbers must not be in the budget. The drivers have either failed their ESL course or are deaf and mute, won't stop to pick someone up if they don't feel like it, the automated stop announcements are either non-existent or off by one or two stops.",hankkacz
50,Best way to travel in L.A.......wish its service was extended to more places!,"They have a user friendly website and the ""trip planner"" gives you all the options for the metrolink buses as well as metro rail. You can plan out your entire journey easily. However, do note that the metro rail does not get you to places like Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, La Brea, etc though they have the buses covering these areas and since we did not use the bus option, I would not know how good they are or what their ontime performance is.But the rail service is very good - clean coaches, easy connections, and one travels in comfort.You get your TAP card from the vending machines at the stations (@ $1 each - one time cost) & then either load a ""day pass"" or a single trip fare or even any fixed amount which gets deducted each time you use the card. The vending machines are easy to operate - one can also see a demo on the Metro website of how to operate the TAP machines.If the Metro rail covers the destinations that you wish to visit, then it is definitely the best way to travel in LA",kent19

10,New Gold Line Metro Stations in Azusa are huge problem,"There are six new eastern stations of the Metro Gold Line. Two are in the city of Azusa. Metro Rail took three years to build the extension which was a major challenge. The new stations opened in early March 2016. The farthest east station in the Gold Line is near Azusa Pacific University. The city of Azusa still has not created the very short road from a city street to the metro parking building. I had to access the parking building and station by driving thru a meditation retreat center. I can't believe this small task has not been accomplished. Secondly, the parking building was full so I had to drive to the other Azusa station in downtown. That station was also 'full'. However I did walk into the building to make sure and I found dozens of parking spaces left empty. They were 'reserved' for electric cars. I think electric cars are great. But there are very few at this time. I would appreciate a review of 'current needs' and make adjustments as electric cars are more common. As a result, I drove on to Pasadena and parked at its most eastern station as I usually do. That meant when I needed to come back from downtown later in the day, I joined all the others in the 'freeway parking lot known as Interstate 210'. Metro should be a system where use of freeways is lessened, with stations conveniently spaced. I appreciate and laud the Metro Rail for the huge investment in these six new stations. But it does not work for those of us who want to catch the system in Azusa. I had planned to have dinner at a restaurant in Azusa when I got off the metro. However instead, I was very late due to the grid lock on the freeway and drove by Azusa and ate in Claremont instead.",Raymond H

40,LA Metro Rail is quick and easy,"LA Metro could learn a few tricks from other cities on communicating trips by train especially when combining with other companies like MetroLink or Amtrak. They get a ""D"" for that. However, once you know where you are going, the Metro is fabulous. I often take from Culver City Expo station to Downtown, an easy change of trains, minimal wait. Elevators are always disgusting and smell of urine; the cleaner used by janitor is just as overwhelming. Makes travel around LA easy for a tourist as the train can be taken from the Westside (soon from Santa Monica maybe May, 2016) to Culver City, to Staples Center/Nokia Theater, to Hollywood (You want to avoid driving to Hollywood at all costs-traffic is horrible- and carry minimal stuff/money beware of pickpockets, but otherwise okay). Going to the Hollywood Bowl or Dodger Stadium? Take Metro with shuttle bus; easy, cheap, and no traffic hassle. Going to Disneyland, you could take Metro/Metrolink (Metrolink has agreat flatrate weekend price for like 10-20 all weekend. Go have lunch in San Clemente on the pier; train station 50 feet from pier restaurant and sunsets. Take to the Music Center downtown. I would avoid Persian Square stop as there are too many aggressive panhandlers and nasty looking thugs at that stop. Train to Pasadena for lunch, or to El Monte/San Gabriel for the extended ChinaTown (LA has one downtown, but San Gabriel is a huge Asian neighborhood). Or, go to Redondo Beach and Costco; Long Beach and see the Queen Mary or Ports of Call. Take the Metro, leave the car. You can also walk your bicycles on board. This would be a fun way to explore LA: rent a bike (buy gloves and sunscreen), take Metro to an area, then ride.....wheeeee!",activeB

30,Public transportation getting better,"Los Angeles is so spread out that the car manufacturers and oil companies have made it difficult to navigate Southern California without a car. Over the last two decades the public Metro Rail system has grown tremendously from downtown L.A. to Long Beach, Pasadena, Santa Monica, Hollywood, and is still growing. For visitors this is great, but for local Angelenos it is hard to give up your vehicle that you have become so accustom to so that public transportation can work for us.",Phillip B

40,A new way to LAX.,Just decided to try this for a new way to LAX. I could use more signage about when a train is coming and where it's going. But a very nice ride.From Pasadena one gets off the train at Union Station and heads to the LAX Flyaway bus stop. Remember to buy the ticket at a kiosk before you leave the station.,Robert L
50,travel off peak,"we stayed in Downtown LA and right near a metro station. We went all over LA from South East shopping right over to the Getty Ctr on the northern part of LA. Best thing is if you are a senior - over 62 then you travel for 35c !! you get two hours to get to where you are going, off peak. Great value for money we travelled all over the place even on Metro buses. We saw more of LA than on a tour and the drivers were ultra friendly. The Metro is for more central locations so doesn't get down to Anaheim or the beaches but if you want to see LA on a real budget and meet very interesting folks then take the metro. We never travelled on peak but imagine its like Rome or London avoid if you can.",NZBunny
50,Easy to use.,The metro rail was easy to use and in a great location from Downtown L.A. We purchased the all day pass for $7 and it came in handy. Clean and very fast. Take advantage!,Renee F
40,A benefit of living in central LA,"I used metro rail all the time while my car was being repaired last year. It was actually awesome to be able to read/nap/study/write rather than cursing in traffic on the 10. More Angelenos should take advantage of this service. There is online information that is updated every hour, so if there are problems with service or late trains, you can stay updated. I found it fairly easy to use, and for the most part, people on the trains are chill. An efficient way of getting out of central LA to the surrounding areas and avoiding traffic.",Marisa C

Taking the Metro Expo line is great if you are going to Staples Center or the Convention Center.",AlwaysGl0beTr0tting
30,"Pricey, but kind of convenient","Although I love the metro and use it whenever possible, I feel that the price has gone up too many times in too short a period. I also think that it would be lovely if they would make use of ALL subterranean tracks so that we'd have more routes available to us. The safety of the rail varies between routes, stations and times of day. Generally, I'd say it's pretty safe...all things considered.",angelia m

40,A great experience!,"i took my 10 yr old daughter to Hollywood for a play at the Pantages ansd wanted to also give her some adventure. We boarded the metro red line at Hollywood & Vine and took it west to the Hollywood & Highland stop. It was very clean, not too many vagrants hanging around and hittin us up for spare change, a relatively easy time using the machine to load funds onto the card for our fares. It was fast, clean and kinda exciting, especially for a 10 year old! Thank you Metro line!!",Rachel Sedacca-Replogle
20,Last Resort Transportation,"If you need to get around LA and have no other choice but The Metro, be warned that it isn't the most pleasant in my experience. I've travelled with friends (male and female) and each time was harassed, one time even groped. There are several people on the metro that are on drugs and make it a very unpleasant experience. That being said if you need to get around town and don't have other options then it will get you from Point A to Point B, but I wouldn't recommend it if you have any other type of transportation.",Sara B
40,"Metro Rail is great for where it goes, which is almost everywhere in Los Angeles County","LA Metro Rail is great for where it goes, which is almost everywhere in Los Angeles County. For a few dollars a person can go sightseeing all over Los Angeles. The best deal is to buy a day pass, or several day pass if in town on vacation. For the most part Metro Rail is clean. Avoid during business rush hour in the mornings and evenings, as the trains and the stations are concerned, most are very clean. Like any subway system, keep valuables safe.",Jess90069

On my car I had a gangbanger discussing prison with his female companion, and a crazy man talking to himself who took offence at imagined slights who was about to go off the rails (no pun intended). I, as a petite older female, was actually scared. It's not an experience I'll be repeated. I've drive and pay to park or take a cat.",Koda

It's a quick hop back on to get downtown to restaurants, MOCA, the new Broad & Japanese American museums. Clean, convenient, safe & fun travel. Give it a try...Enjoy....",David B L
40,Who knew we had such a great metro rail system in Los Angeles?!,"My son has used Metro Rail every weekday for the past three years, so he ought to review it himself; perhaps he has. He likes it. I had ridden it before, but only when it was free (when the Blue Line and then the Expo Line first opened), or only for a couple of stops. Recently I've made two significant trips on the Los Angeles Metro, one requiring a transfer from one line to another, which finally brought me into the subterranean vaults of the place... and I was pleasantly surprised! Compared to other subways in other cities, this one seemed clean, airy, like a newly-built modernistic airport terminal or the foyer of an opera hall. I don't normally like ""Modern"" architecture but this is Modern done right: beautiful, functional, classy. I am really impressed.In fact, I wanted to give it FIVE stars, but I simply can't do that until the LA Metro reaches at least one of the major airports in the LA area, preferably LAX, but the Burbank Airport would count too, in my opinion. This has been promised for fifteen years and doesn't seem like it might ever happen.But for where the Metro Rail system DOES go, I love it.(Another thing that earns it five stars— sorry, four for now— allowing bikes to be brought right into the rail cars. Even my longtail Xtracycle had no trouble. You'll see some guys carrying their bikes up or down stairs in the multi-level underground Metro stations, but that's only because they want the exercise and/or don't want to wait for an elevator. The elevators are plenty big enough for bicycles, even mine; if you do find a small elevator somewhere and you have a longtail or a long-wheelbase recumbent, try standing it on end in the corner of the elevator. Has worked every time for me.)",AngelenoNic

40,Great experience ... smooth ride,"This is the cheapest and easy way to get around the city but doesn't go to all places, apparently due to earthquake issues.The Metro Rail can take you to Downtown, Hollywood, Pasadena, Chinatown, USC & Exposition Park, Union Station, Staples Center, Little Tokyo, Long Beach, Universal Studios, East Los Angeles, and numerous other destinations. For $5.00 (+ $1 or $2 for the TAP Card ""electronic pass card""), you can have unlimited rides.For me was one of the easier metro to get around in. Things are well done and I basically was able to stay on the Metro Red Line, as my hotel was less than half a block from a Metro Red Line station and the best spots in LA are also ""in the Red line"". The trains and stations are very well-maintained. Plan your trip using their website and you will soon be riding without problems. I found it easy to navigate, inexpensive and very safe.Great experience for a smooth ride ... recommended",Coutito

After work a few friends decided hey let's go to Olvera St. so we left ur cars parked at work and hopped on the metro rail to union station. We felt very safe and we had a great time.

To go one way, It took me two hours and three transportation changes (one high speed bus ride and two metro train rides - red line and gold line) to get to my destination. Depending on where you are going, it is sometimes not the most efficient way to travel, however, it will save you the time sitting in a car in congested freeway traffic.",Raji R
50,great way to travel,"I bought the 7-day unlimited use pass for $25 and a reusable TAP card for $1 a few months ago. The Metro is the best way to get around to certain parts of Los Angeles, IMO.

50,Great!,I regularly used the red line to get between my hotel and union station and down town as well as hollywood - I also used the yellow line - I believe this is a very underused mode of transit in LA. The stations were clean and safe with trains running about every 15 mins depending on time of day. Only wish there was a train to santa monica/venice beach as hard to get to these locations without a car. I went with a 7 day pass and definetly got my moneys worth :-),LukeNickels

Since it was her first trip, I still wanted to give her a tour and it was fabulous. What impressed us were the lines. The lines are small and if there was a line, there was at some stops, people are patient and don’t shove. We live in Beijing and my wife is forced to use the Beijing subway and it is truly a nightmare. The train is so packed and you feel like a sardine. It is very dangerous for women because as they are packed in, men take an opportunity to become touchy feely and they have often tried to open her backpack. It is cheap but such a horrible experience. The LA metro was perfect and can take you to most places in LA without getting stuck in traffic.",Daniel A
50,Quick and easy service!,While visiting the Los Angeles area I decided to take the Metro Rail from Universal/Studio City to Hollywood/Highland. It's the most inexpensive way to get around in L.A.

50,Give it a try,"Taking Metro Rail from south Orange County to LA is a pleasure. SoCal traffic is infamous for congestion, sig alerts and construction and Metro allows you to avoid it all. We Ubered to our hotel, and then Ubered all over the city for less money than it would have cost to park at the hotel for three nights, plus, I didn't have to drive all over LA either. Public transportation in LA and SoCal is still in its infancy but getting off the freeway makes the efforts worthwhile. The train was on time, clean, air conditioned, smooth and very economical.",Lynne H
30,LA's best way to get around when you're not in a hurry to get there.,Tap Card system doesn't seem to me to be the most efficient way to do things but I'm no expert other than that it is not the best nor the worst metro/train system out there. Sure its not always on time and its not the quickest or most efficiently run form of public transportation but for a car city like Los Angeles its pretty good. It will get you to a lot of places without having to pay extra for parking such as the Staples Center or the Hollywood Bowl. And once it gets waaaay out west to the beach it will be that much closer to being very good to take people where they want to go. If only they could figure out to get it to pay for itself by opening up more advertising or something to the private sector... just sayin.,ivy99

40,worth a journey,"I take the Red line to Metro and 7th downtown and switch to Blue Expo line to get to USC. Really excellent once you figure out that cars with red strip are ""blue lline"" and also ""purple line."" Unfortunately, the signage is poor. When you get to the Metro and 7th stop you need to take the staircase upstairs that says to ""Long Beach."" Be sure to TAP each time before you get on a new train. Always listen when you get on the train, occassionally the destination changes.Good to know: if there is trouble on the track when you are in downtown station (Metro and 7th) you can go up to surface and get buses. Use Metro trip planner to be sure of the train and bus to take.I take the train back to Universal studios station from USC as long as it is light outside while waiting on the tracks.There is NO shade for most of the stations, they are designed so the shade goes on the tracks or grass along the tracks, wear a hat.Trains are wonderfully clean as MOST people obey the instruction not to eat or drink on the platform or on the train.Some stations have adjacent parking, North Hollywood and Universal Studios fill up by 7:30 am, then some parking after 11. at Universal you can do Park and Ride lot and walk a few blocks anytimeMany stations have a staff member in a bright yellow and orange jacket that says ""Metro"" who can help.USC University Park has two train stops, check the campus map on USC website to see which is best for your destination, it is a big campus at University Park AND some USC events happen at the ATT building downtown, or the Health Science center (HSC is Union station and USC shuttle bus combo).Keep your TAP card handy for random checks. You need it only to get on trains, no need to use when you are getting off and out of the station. Dispensing machines at each station. Seniors must apply in advance to get special rate.

50,A great alternative to the car,"Having visited LA numerous times over the past 10+ years, the one thing you can count on is TRAFFIC - there are 'way too many cars and not enough lanes on the freeways to accommodate them. Our daughter lives in the Hollywood part of LA and she suggested we take the Metro line down Hollywood Blvd to get to the Dolby Theater, and see the Oscars show as it was being set up. A terrific idea. Fare cards and 'add fare' instructions are easy to use (however, everyone does need their own card - you can't share as in some cities transportation systems). The trains are frequent, and many people use them - I thought everyone was in a car in the roads above, but the subway is a very popular transportation choice. Try it!",NH_Joe
50,Stress free Los Angeles,"I'm a Southern California native who grew up taking public transit all over the area. After years away, new transit options have made getting all over the city for almost nothing - especially when you consider the pice of gasoline, parking, and the reason you are visiting the area; to relax!Cost - You should go to a Metro station or I've heard on the bus and purchase a TAP card, $1.00. One way trip cost $1.75 with a two hour transfer window to change buses and get to your destination. An alternative would be a one day or seven day pass - $7.00 or $25.00. Most attractions around the city are grouped, thus think of the Metro as a low cost Hop-On-Hop-Off Bus. If you are a senior citizen, 62 and older check the senior rates - .75 cents peak hours .35 cents off peak!Need to know when a bus is coming? Call 511, say Next Trip and follow the prompts. The system searches by line or stop number. The system isn't perfect but works, some patience is the key - oh yes your on vacation! There is also an app for the system you can download. Going a distance consider using a Rapid line. These are generally long distance busses that doesn't make all the local bus stops.Try the light rails system - there are five color labeled lines that covers various directions of the city. This system is basically similar to other systems in other cities around the US. Cost identical to the bus.Whether the bus or light rail, using the systems is easy. The website and trip planner makes your visit easy. Can't decide where to begin? Looking for an overview of the city? Try the trip planner starting at your destination and put in an ending point somewhere across the city, buy a day pass and just go.

40,Metro & bus system in LA,"I have been a dedicated rider of the Metro & bus system in Greater Los Angeles since 2005. Overall, and considering how widespread the city is, and hoe entrenched into ""car-only"" transportation most (not all) people and local politicians are in this town, the public transport system (metro & busses) is quite good, really.Certainly, poor decisions have been made, which have delayed its much needed expansion, but overall we should be proud: our trains and buses are not much dirtier than in other major cities around the world - sure they could be cleaner, but that is the problem of many riders. The system runs fairly on time - better than other major metropolitan centers worldwide. Sure it could improve, but traffic in LA is traffic - it is not s problem of the buses but of the too many individuals who drive alone in their cars (vs car-pooling).The major concern is the fact that it is is under-developed for the need of Angelinos across a wide LÀ basin. For instance, area remain shockingly under-served, despite the fact that they are growing neighborhoods with new schools, etc. Take the Porter Ranch area, for example, the ""new Encino"": no fast & simple way to reach Union Station, LAX, USC or UCLA. From the communities in the hills - similar to Hollywood Hills where from one can go just about anywhere - you cannot even go to CSUN, because there is not even a Dash service.Let us hope that sooner than not MTA officials will begin to look at the network in terms of how best to serve the riders!",FChiappelli
30,Not the safest method of transport!,The LA metro is expansive and huge and covers everywhere from Long Beach up to Hollywood and much more. Lots of beggars and homeless people in both the stations and trains however which can be quite intimidating. The majority of these beggars are fine but travelling alone or with luggage makes you a bigger target - I'm 26 and well travelled and I was slightly intimidated so if you were a younger traveller or a single female you need to exercise caution. Overall a good experience to get around a large city just needing to be careful and travel in day hours if possible.,Tom L
40,Worked well for us,"We just returned from a 6 night vacation to LA. We used public transportation throughout our stay. We got a week pass for $25 each and found the trains to be clean, safe, and easy to use.",Leah B
40,Better than expected,"We were visiting downtown to cheer some friends running for a marathon in downtown LA. It was a nice subway ride from Hollywood area to downtown. In a way it was more convenient than driving across town - no need to worry about traffic jam or finding/paying for parking. The subway cars and stations are fairly clean with informative directional signs. It is quite cheap, and most importantly - it's good for the environment by reducing the amount of air pollution coming from so many cars on the road. However, the subway trains were not that frequent compared to metro systems in other major cities, so it was a bit disappointing; and too bad they don't have more stops in other popular areas in LA like West Hollywood or Santa Monica.",LouC151
50,Don't believe Angelino nay-sayers!,"Many ( not all) Angelinos, and most tourist guide books will tell you that you ""can't see LA without a car"" and/or ""Trust me, you don't want to use the bus/metro/whatever"" TOSH - don't believe them.As a visitor you can get to most of the tourist hot spots, and many many not so hot using public transport. I have just spent 3 weeks here and can attest to that.The network of subway, metro rapid buses, busways, and above ground trains is extensive, and growing, fast, clean, efficient and CHEAP ($1.75 per trip no matter where and transfers included). You can park and ride at many stations, or leave your bike in a secure locker, or chained up, or take it with you on the bus or train.If I didn't have friends in LA I'd probably choose to stay downtown ( where there are good hotels, some fabulous restauranys and bars, and lots of cultural institutions) and plan trips from there.Oh and there is also a shuttle bus service called DASH that gets you around the downtown area.Once you have your TAP card (automated ticket system) and loaded it with a day pass, month pass, or just a $ amount, you are good to go!!Download one of the apps for trip planning - either the metro one or Moovit - and plan your trips ahead.",Arncliffegirl

50,using the metro in LA,"Unbelievable service, very easy to get around LA with the public transit and very cheap to use. I would use this type of transportation over anything else in LA",Frabel-62
40,Easier than driving.,"We only used the Metro Rail a couple of time but to be honest I wish we had used it more rather than having relatives who we were staying with drive us places. We found it easy to navigate, inexpensive and as safe as any other city rail system.",rodgerskay
50,Great way for the tourist to see LA,"Los Angeles traffic is very difficult and really detracts from the enjoyment of any visit there. The Metro Rail system is an excellent alternative for regular commuting and a boon for the tourist who wants to see the sights economically (just $5 for a day pass) and without aggravation. The system consists of rail trunk lines several of which intersect in the downtown area. These rail lines also interface with express and local bus routes, several of which provide equally rapid service. We were staying at a motel near LAX and had easy access to the Green line which was our gateway to the system. The buses and trains on which we rode were clean and comfortable as were most of the stations. The maps are easy to read making the system very easy to navigate. The Metro system is an excellent choice for convenient and enjoyable travel in the Los Angeles area.",Dick B
50,Easy to navigate and more pleasant than driving in LA!,"Two years ago my friends introduced me to the Meto Rail system in LA and ever since it has become my primary means of transportation in the LA area. It is easy to navigate and far more pleasant than trying to drive LA's highways!I recommend taking the Flyaway bus between LAX and Union Station and then using one of the Metro Rail lines. They are convenient and connect with a multitude of bus lines which crisscross the area! And, the proce is right ... only $5 for a day pass!",Tracy M
50,Metro System Wonderful!,"So, it's a myth that LA doesn't have any decent public transport systems. My advice is to leave the car firmly hand braked in the hotel car park and jump on the Metro system. For $7, you can purchase a TAP card which can be used on buses and the underground system for the whole day. The buses are regular and all connect to the train lines. If you ask your hotel about taking public transport most concierges will think you're mad, and will suggest driving or Taxis. We went to see the LA Dodgers in Downtown LA and found the trip from North LA, near Universal city easy and a lot quicker than using the car. If you are going to a Dodgers game there is a free shuttle bus from Union Square station to the ground which starts 90 mins before and also runs throughout the duration of, and after, the game. The LA tourist board and hotels should make more of this service and promote it fully; there are even plans for a Metro extension out to Santa Monica in the near future.",Paul Z
50,Glorious days,Used this method of transportation many times in our 9 day stay. All drivers were extremely helpful with directions and watching for our stops. Never lost which was very comforting. Definitely the way to travel around LA and San Diego. Very reasonable fares.,taj45
50,Riding the Gold Line in LA,"The Light rail from Union Station to Pasadena - jump on and off for coffee in Highland Park, lunch at the Orange Grove in Pasadena and a walk around Old Pasadena town. Great way to see LA",T F
30,Good option for visitors and local people,"During our visit in LA, we used metro everyday! It was cheap ($5 per day) and we went everywhere we can using the metro. Didn't need to rent a car or take a bus. They may need to renovate a little bit but in overall good option for transportation!",raifusal
10,Horrible,"Very affordable! Thought it was quite quiet considering it is LA until people start yelling random things to no one in particular, or dripping blood everywhere, or doing drugs and trying to pedal their wares.... Only saw a couple of people with children traveling and they looked terrified - immediately jumping off at the next stop. There was no helpful information at any of the stations we visited (including bus stops) nor were there any people nearby to lend assistance. There are no bus lanes so the buses are stuck in traffic along with everyone else.",Krys K
50,Get way to see SoCal.,"We have been using the Metro weekend pass for a long time and what a bargain it is. It used to be a better bargain when you could get a weekend pass for $10 but the daily weekend pass for $10 still beats driving anywhere in SoCal and then trying to find parking. The Metro keeps expanding and you can travel to most areas very easily. We have taking many trips with friends to Oceanside, San Juan Capistrano, LA, Santa Monica and Hollywood. We have taken trains from Rialto and Riverside and the stations are well lit and have security so you feel safe and comfortable about leaving a vehicle in the lot. The $10 weekend day pass also covers Metro Light rail and most metro buses. Check out the Metro to the Orange County Fair and express bus to the fair grounds. If you get the weekend day pass it covers the train to Orange County, and the Express Bus to the gate of the fair grounds and return. Plus they give you a coupon on the bus for $3.00 admission to the fair. There is no way you can drive there for that price. We love the Metro, no traffic hassle, no parking hassle and it is fun to do with a group of friends.",James G
50,Bus Pass - LA Metro Area Busses & Metro Lines,". If you don’t want to drive in L.A. (Who does?), we found the Bus Pass for LA Metro Area Busses & Metro Lines a very good value at about $5 per day. The Bus Pass can be purchased at the train station (far end of the train platform tunnel) - ask for a temporary visitor card which does not require a ID photo. It is good for both busses and the light rail lines and will get you just about anywhere in the Metro Area. Bus schedules are available at the train station, on line and on the busses.",Thomas C
40,Can't beat the convenience and the price!,"Los Angeles is finally getting up to speed with mass transit, and the L.A. Metro Rail has proven to be safe, efficient, and economical in a city that's spread out, choked with traffic, and short on affordable parking, esp. in dense tourist areas like Universal Studios and Hollywood. The stations are spacious and clean with trains running well on schedule. I highly recommend tourists and residents alike pick up a map to show service areas, and take the train when possible. It's a hassle free way to get around town on $5 a day.Note: the train does NOT currently have lines to most area beaches or the Westside.",Cattylea
40,Great way to get around during rush hour in the city of angels.,Went from Pershing to Hollywood in minutes. Efficient. Was disappointed that L.A. doesn't post stops as well as Atlanta which really makes one have to pay attention. It is clean compared to east coast subways by far. No problems.,BeachLuvr1960
40,fab but limited,we used the metro rail almost everyday to get to most places however there are lots of places that need lots of changes and can be quite hard work to figure out how to get to a place! if trying to go to hollywood walk of fame etc. its very good! otherwise it will mean link ups with rail/bus/walk/bus etc.,nikkijr93
40,Better public transit than expected,"Most people don't think LA has very good public transit. In many ways, they would be right. However, it's worth noting that it's actually better than one might think. The main downside is limited connectivity between certain points at distances. There's no subway line connecting the Red line to the Blue down in Long Beach (i.e. parallel to the 405), which is desperately needed. Still, if there's a chance for me to take the metro somewhere instead of driving, I'll take it!",EmBentley
40,Take transit when visiting LA!,"Angelenos are addicted to their cars. No matter how short the trip, they'll hop in their car, burn some fossil fuels and be late and stressed out to boot rather than hop a train or god forbid WALK. HahaAs background, in the 1940s Los Angeles had plans for what would have been one of the best public transportation systems in the world making it a true walking city - what with our lovely weather and all. But then the car and tire industries started waving money around, and when that didn't work, took to threatening bullying the city folks in charge. Not too long afterward they succumbed to pressure and abandoned their grand vision for LA.Some have since tried to turn that around and the system is now more than adequate. It really is more a mindset than anything.If you visit LA consider taking a bus, rail or train to see the sights. We actually do have a good, clean, safe and reliable system and if we locals can't figure out that we can avoid the nightmares of traffic and parking and help save the environment to boot - well then that just leaves more seats for our brilliant out-of-town guests.",SDAdventurers
50,It's not London or Paris,"It's not London or Paris, the Metro makes you feel that you are in Los Angeles. Check out the Hollywood and Vine station that is steeped in the favors of Hollywood. Make time to stop at Union Station and walk a block to Phillippes for lunch.Buy an all day pass and travel to Long Beach, Universal City, and Old Town Pasadena. The Metro gives the distinct flavor of Los Angeles.",Cavydad
40,A Great Way to See LA,"A fledgling compared to the public transit systems in other metropolises, LA County's Metro Rail provides an alternative for seeing many of LA's sights without fighting traffic and searching for parking. I like to catch the trains at the Jefferson/La Cienega station on the Expo Line, but there are also a number of other stations that provide convenient, free parking. The Metro Rail can take you to Downtown, Hollywood, Pasadena, Chinatown, USC & Exposition Park, Union Station, Staples Center, Little Tokyo, Long Beach, Universal Studios, East Los Angeles, and numerous other destinations. For $5.00 (plus $1 or $2 for the electronic pass card if you don't have one, known as a ""TAP"" card), you have a day of unlimited use of the system, or you can pay $1.50 each time you board. The network is a work in progress, with the Expo Line currently being extended to Santa Monica and extensions being proposed through Beverly Hills, Century City, and Westwood, as well as east along the San Gabriel Valley. The frequency of the trains varies with the time of day, but is generally every 10-20 minutes. The trains can get crowded during the weekday peak hours. The subway (Red and Purple Lines) moves expeditiously between stations. The light rail (Blue, Gold, Green, and Expo Lines) provides views of the various communities through the trains' large windows. The Gold Line between Union Station and Pasadena provides some of the most enjoyable viewing. In Long Beach, the scarlet Passport Buses in Downtown provide free travel to the Queen Mary, the Aquarium of the Pacific, Shoreline Village, and other nearby destinations from the Metro Station. The Hollywood/Highland Station takes you right to the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the TCL (Grauman's) Chinese Theatre. A short stroll from Union Station is LA's birthplace, Olvera Street, where the City's Mexican heritage is celebrated. No food or drink are allowed on the trains.",Larry S
30,Venice Beach to Hollywood and Back for only $1.25!,"The Metro bus system in Los Angeles has vastly improved since my last experience in 2006. Like any public transportation system, it's not without problems. But, if you want to save money - my travel companion who is 62 rode for a mere Quarter on Sunday, try the Metro system. Do your homework before you arrive. There's a valuable trip planner on their website which tells you exactly with bus you need and where the bus stop is located.Then, download the free app. It was invaluable in our adventures. You'll know exactly when the next bus will arrive at your stop (the GPS on your phone shows where you are) and what time the next 3 or 4 buses will arrive. It gives you time to plan your activities around the pick-up times instead of wasting valuable time at the stop.You can buy a day pass on the bus for only $5 per day. They fail to mention that you have to have a Tap Card so the driver charged me an additional dollar for the card. Together for the two of us, we spent $7.25 to go from Venice Beach to Hollywood - only two buses needed each way. A taxi would have cost us $45 each way! Bus dropped us right off at Hollywood & Vine!Use the public transportation and ""Be Green""",Debra1love
30,Can be tough to navigate,"My teenage daughter and I (the mom) didn't rent a car for our 5 day trip to LA, Anaheim and Pasadena. Relying on public transit isn't something I'm used to, so it was challenging at times. Most of the people riding the buses and trains were very friendly and helpful, without our even asking - we must have looked lost! The first day we purchased the TAP day pass cards and loved that aspect. It was a great deal and worked very easily. If you're riding transit in any of these places other days, hang on to your cards for reloading! We didn't realize they all use the same system and packed our cards and had to buy new ones. You also can't use one card for 2 people even though it works out to the same amount of money. If you tap your card and go through a turn style, it's done and won't scan again. This left my daughter stranded on one side with me cursing, buying another card from the machine on the other. The machine also wouldn't let me just buy a single ride ticket even though it was listed on the top of the machine advertisement. Very frustrating! I ended up overloading our cards to a combined total of $5, which I gave away to someone when we got where we were going and made them very happy. No great loss to me. People working in the hotels often don't know how long rides take via buses, so we lost a lot of time that way, even having to jump in a taxi for one return trip from Santa Monica Beach back to our LAX hotel. We tried to do a trip from that hotel to Hollywood (said to take 30 minutes but took just under 2 hours), on to the beach and back. Our bus driver in Hollywood was EXTREMELY rude and unhelpful and seemed downright angry when I showed him the map the information lady there had given us with the bus numbers and routes we needed, and I wanted to make sure were getting on the correct bus. Several parts of our journey this day were scary for us in some of the areas we traveled and I didn't feel all that safe. It is quite an eye opener though for seeing how some people are living there, and we chalked it up to experience. Anaheim and Pasadena were quite nice to travel by bus and I must admit that the trains from Anaheim to Union Station to Pasadena are really great IF you know where you need to get off in Pasadena. The maps on the platforms and in the train aren't that helpful to tourists in my opinion, but it would be hard to put all information people need on a map. I should have done more research online beforehand.",tkpruden
50,I did not know LA even had an underground train system.,"I have used the ""Underground"" in Tokyo, London, Paris, and Sydney as a cheap, effective way of getting around congested Cities. Until this trip, I did not know Los Angeles even had an underground train system. In January, after flying from Honolulu, my Son suggested we take the train from LAX to West Hollywood. Sounded like an adventure so we did it. Sussed it all out on the Internet first, which was very easy.Had to take the Flyaways bus from LAX to Union Station $7 each. The station was a real eye opener, modern, and efficient.The ticketing system, using ""Tap"" cards was about the easiest we have ever used, and at $2.50 flat rate per ride it is cheap. The train route map is very easy to follow, and we took the ""red line"".The train was bang on time (runs about every 12 minutes), it was clean, plenty of seats and very quick. We were at Highland Station in no time, and emerged from the subway right onto the Hollywood walk of fame. Brilliant.The next day we took the Metro train to Universal Studios - cheap and quick, and no Parking cost.Well done LA, your underground rail system, although seemingly a well kept secret, is an absolute gem!",Steve A
50,"Try it, it is easier than you think","I have always heard you must rent a car in LA.This is our maiden voyage sans car, and it worked out. The system is clean and safe, convenient schedules and easy to use. Flyaway from Airport to Union Station, gold line to Pasadena and even a trip back into LA. We used the Metro and the associated buses. See the world, drink in the local culture, take public transportation.Day pass : $ 5Trip : $1.50",Sheilavehla
50,Brilliant way to get around,"The price of a whole day on the Metro is just $5 (plus an extra $1 if you don't have a subway card) - which is superb value for money considering that you can go quite a long way with it.Admittedly you need to have your wits about you when travelling the Metro - it isn't scary but you need to be aware of what is around you.However, the trains are fast and as long as you know where you're going and any line changes you are going to have to make - there is no better way to navigate yourself round the city. It is fast, cheap and takes you right to the centre. I would definitely recommend this above using a car - especially Tourists that can get a bit confused with the lane systems and junctions!",ajw9
30,"Decent, but.......","First of all, you must know ahead of time which station to which you are traveling. Secondly, riding can be frightening; not so much dangerous, just scary. The line and stations in downtown LA are fine; in south LA, it is a different story. There are no tourist spots on the lines/stations in south LA, except Watts Towers on the blue line. Speaking of which, taking the blue line can be scary when south of Watts, it runs through Compton and will be ridden by alcoholics and drug addicts. Most of the green line has this problem, east of Willowbrook. Be prepared to hear someone else's stereo, like it or not. The green line west of Inglewood, to Redondo Beach is fine. Downtown and East LA are both different from south LA; and, not as scary. All the Metro lines wheelchair accessible, but afternoons can get crowded.",salmanal
50,Senior Citizen Special,"If you are over the age of 62 there are significantly reduced rates on the metro. During off-peak hours I traveled from Union Station to Pasadena for $.25. Really!

40,Great way to get around LA - gets you to most major attractions on the cheap!,"Yes, I live in LA & I have taken the Metro on several occasions - it is an easy way to get where you want to go if you don't want to drive. Whether it's the Red, Blue, Purple, Expo, Orange, or Yellow, the Metro will get you where you need to go! To be more environmentally friendly, the system has recently converted from tickets to needing to buy a tap card & recharge it as you go so be aware of this as an extra fee. The stations are well-lit & well-maintained, and sometimes the adventure actually happens on the Metro. Plan your trip using their website & you will soon be on your way without worries!",Mystica33
20,"This is not the GO you know, eh!","Cheap - yes. Clear instructions - no. Why do I have to buy a plastic card to load one trip? When I transfer between lines do I have to pay again? If not, what do the transfer stations do? Are there any humans around that I can ask a question of? Why do I have to buy one ticket at a time for four people? Etc. Lots of questions. Hint to newbies - during off peak hours you are not likely to find cabs near the station. Hint #2 definitely do not ride out to Culver City on the Expo line thinking you will find a cab there. Hint #3 ignore the nervous/anxious black youths with gang style hoodies - they are just worried about possibly missing their connection to Santa Monica (reassure them that the train will wait for them). Hint #4 - you have to push the button for the doors to open - even us tourists know this. Hint #5 - some people are really nice in LA - the guys that looked like they were car jacking a vehicle in the parking lot - called a cab for us (lost Canadians ...). Don't worry Rich (wearing a name tag ...), I have forgotten what you look like already. Be ready for adventure!",Traveling_Dad48
40,Surprisingly Nice,"The nice part about the Metro Rail system is that in general the trains are well air conditioned, usually pretty clean and actually come on time. As I am originally from New York I was shocked to see cars with air conditioning that actually seem to work! Most of the time the trains are also pretty reliable.As with most subway systems there are different lines. For example, the Gold Line runs from East Pasadena through Union Station in downtown Los Angeles and then on to East LA. If you want to go to Chinatown or Little Tokyo taking Metro Rail is really convenient.The Red Line serves the Hollywood area. You can change at Union Station from some of the other lines to get the Red Line. For Grauman's Chinese Theatre just exit the Red Line at Hollywood & Highland. There are other lines also such as Blue, Green and Purple.The disadvantage to Metro Rail is that Los Angeles is huge and the trains don't go everywhere. You may have to change lines several times or change to a bus to get to where you want to go. Also the Tap card system to buy your ticket can be confusing at first. But Metro Rail has come a long way since it first started.",JohnB00007

50,Excellent excellent excellent,"It is an absolute furphy that you need a car to tour in Los Angeles.The LA Metro subway (tube) system is simply wonderful. Clean, secure, quick, frequent, safe and well policed this system gets you around town much quicker than a car can. And if the subway can't get you to where you're going then the Metro buses will.We have been to LA on numerous occasions and never hired a motor car. We get around exclusively on the Metro (subway, Rapid and Metro buses) system.A daily $5 ticket for all you can eat on the entire system makes it a very, very affordable system to tour LA on.What makes the LA Metro even better is the support provided for tourists by way of the printed tour pamphlets produced by the Metro - touring by the subway line - just excellent. And the website provides an excellent resource especially when using a smartphone - just enter the address or attraction that you want to get to and it'll tell you exactly how to get there. Fully supported by Google maps too!Again, you do NOT need a car to tour Los Angeles - you just need the Metro.",AJD57
40,Convenient to use and fast,"We were touring los angeles without a car, and some people told us it is impossible to tour without a car, well the metro made it easy for us especially if you chose a hotel that is very close to a metro station.We bought a TAP card and used it to transfer to the main sights in los angeles, including universal studios and disneyland, and the reason i advice you to get a hotel close to a metro station is that if you want to return to the hotel late at night you will have minimal distance to walk at night.We also used google maps App to get directions for the destinations we were going, and even if there is no metro it will give you instructions on riding metro buses with the same card you haveBut my complaint is that the instructions they put on the machines to buy the card wasn't so easy to follow.",HD76HD76
30,Metro rail senior discount fare,"I saw several prior posts indicating that there is no option to enter the senior fare when buying the ""tap"" tickets from the vending machines. I had the same issue today and since I had time, I went to the Customer Service booth to inquire. She said you cannot get the senior rate from the vending machines because they require a ""human"" to verify your age. So attention seniors, to get the discount, you need to buy your tap pass at the Customer Service Booth. The Senior Day Pass is only $1.80 and in the vending machine, it's $5 + $1 for the initial tap card. If you buy it from the vending machine, you can't get a refund for the difference. That being said, the Metro Rail itself (red, purple, blue & gold lines) is wonderful. It was very clean, efficient and easy to use.",travelinsis
40,Reliable and Safe,"I'm a subway surfer. I enjoy commuting on the subways or metros in all the cities I visit. So I'm surprised when I was told that LA could not be explored by metro or public transport. Driving is the norm. While that is true to some extent, I found the Metro Rail system to be easy to use. Certainly not as ""complex"" as Tokyo or NYC. Many stops along the different colored lines has interesting places to explore. Well, it doesn't cover all of LA, of course. Places in LA are so well spread out. It's impossible for the Metro to cover all places. So be realistic. But if you wanna see Hollywood, Downtown LA, or visit the suburbs like Culver City, Pasadena etc, the Metro Rail is more than good enough. It also easily connects to other parts of CA through the Metrolink and Amtrak. To me, it is user-friendly and efficient for getting to the main spots around LA, Hollywood and surrounds.",Walking with Wings
20,"Great experience, but instructions on ticket purchase& screeningPOOR","Went from culver city metro to LA convention center. The ride was great once you got on, but better work needs to be done on ticket purchase & entry screening.

It only gives a one day pass rate.All 3 of the sheriff personnel were waiting in the parking lot chatting while about 8 of us were trying to figure out how to purchase tickets. After getting our tickets, there was no entry screening gates&ticket receipts like in New York, DC , etc & with unclear ticket purchase instructions,I saw some people just getting on without paying.",Hearoak4
40,Easy option to get from Hollywood to Universal Studios,We can only provide limited information as we only used the Metro train system to go from Hollywood to Universal Studios. Quick run down as there was no one there to assist us but it was fairly easy to work out. You have to go to the auto ticket machines before entering the gates & select the options for the purchase of a TAP card. Fares are one way only so if you want return make sure you double the $ amount you want to load on the TAP card so you don't have to load the card a second time at the other end. Use the large colored line maps on the station walls to work out which train line to go on. It was only a couple of stops to Universal Studios & if you go up to the street level & cross the road there is a shuttle about a block down which will take you straight there. Hope this helps!!!,tonman69
40,"A fast, easy and inexpensive way to get around","If you are visiting L.A. and don't want to fight traffic and spend money on expensive gas, Metro is the way to go.

Take the Blue Line and get to Long Beach. Take the Expo Line to the California Science Center. So much to explore and you can get on and off with the day pass as much as you want. You don't have to worry about driving, only having fun visiting L.A.'s many attractions.",Gerry D
30,Limited routes and confusing TAP system for buying tickets,We used this to get from universal to get to hollywood boulevard which was ideal. The metro does not cover all areas of LA . You have to buy a TAP card and then add an appropriate fare to the card. We worked it out after a while but very confusing . No staff anywhere to ask !!! Machines not very clear. Easy to pay for wrong fares. Found a friendly passenger to help us.,KKMANX
20,Metro Line's awful TAP System,"The new TAP system is the most user unfriendly I've ever experienced. Travelling on many US transit systems and in other countries is infinitely easier. Not only confusing to passengers, MTA representaives at the stations don't know it either and give out wrong information.At every station ticket machine, numerous passenger leave puzzled, angry or fearful that they have purchaed the wrong fare ticket. Navigating the ticket machine monitor is so confusing and NO senior fare is noted. It used to be (a month ago) that you would face the monitor, press the appropriate button for destination, transfer, round trip or senior/disabled fare and a ticket would come out within seconds. Now it takes far too long to still not be able to get the correct fare ticket.Is this a ploy by the MTA to eliminate the senior fare but not tell us????? If it is, it's working.As a senior, the fare, only a month or so ago, was $.25 per trip. Wonderful!!!! Now the MTA doesn't even have a senior fare BUT it cost me $6.00 for two round trip fares to downtown LA on the Expo Line from the La Cienega/Jefferson Station. The MTA representative at the La Cienega Station had me purchase a blue TAP card for $1.25 and told me it was good for one year. The next time I ""TAPPED"" the monitor it said the card was invalid but was good till 2015????At the Union Station, the monitor again told me it was invalid but asked if I would like to add fare to the card. I pressed the $1.50 button but only had a $5 bill and inserted it. I received a receipt for the $1.50 but received only $.25 change!!!!! This is a pretty sneaky way to get added fare income. To top this trip off my now delayed trip was further delayed by a car running into our train.I guess the $6.00 was for the added excitement.In today's technologicaly savy society, implementing a simple menu shouldn't be too difficult to communicate clearly, others do it.",Arturo F
50,Great way to get to the L.A. Coliseum,"I hate to admit this, but Saturday was my first time riding the Metro Rail (I live in L.A.). It was a great experience.We had visitors & were going to the Coliseum to see a USC football game....not looking forward to dealing with 90,000 people trying to park, so we decided to park in my garage downtown & walk 3 blocks to the 7th Street metro station where we caught the Expo Line to USC/Coliseum.The station was well-staffed with friendly, helpful people and the train was on time & clean.After the game, Metro Rail had put helpful signs around campus & the Coliseum area leading us back to where we caught our train home. They even had signs for folks to line up, depending on which direction one needed to go....no guessing or confusion.I look forward to riding Metro Rail again soon.",pickygirl2
50,Los Angeles without a car!,"OK, so not without a car at all, but there are many places you can go in LA using Metro Rail. The trains are really nice and the stations modern, brightly lit and clean. I dropped my rental car in San Diego and then used Amtrak, Metro Rail and Bus to get to my friend's house near USC. Once in LA, we went a number of places (Culver City, downtown) without taking a car. Combine rail with Express Bus and you really can get somewhere without a car.",Lou S
50,Quick and cheap,"Cannot believe how good the rail service is considering how little you pay. It's not perfect by any means and doesn't go as far as some other cities, but it was quick to the places I wanted to go (Hollywood, Universal Studios, parts of Downtown) and $20 to use it - and the buses - for a week is excellent. Even when I lost my card and had to buy a day pass for my final day I managed to get great value.Helped that it was just a couple of minutes walk from the hotel as well.",SMTID
50,Excellent service,"The stations are all very nice, compared to the New York subway.Its clean everywhere there are no homeless people. A train arives all 10 to 15 minutes which is great. We should have something like that in Basel, Switzerland.",Claudio B
40,Fast and easy,"This Metro is fast (for the most part) and super-easy to use. Affordable, too - $1.50 per ride. Just load $ on your TAP card and go. No AC in carts, though... stations in downtown Hollywood and LA are actual subway stations (i.e., run underground) but everything else seems to be above the ground (which I personally am not a fan). Relatively clean. Metro doesn't run in Santa Monica (the closest station is Culver City).",Natalia C
10,WARNING: Paying is nearly impossible! Avoid Metro if at all possible.,"Passengers cannot buy a ticket. A Tap card must be PURCHASED (unlike the free cards in other cities). Minimum is $20. There is no longer a senior fare!!!!! To say that it is confusing and inconvenient is an understatement. I travel on public transportation systems in many American and foreign cities and have never, ever had a problem paying. If you don't have a car or are using taxis, visit another city. San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, Chicago, Amsterdam, you name it and they're friendly to those using public transportation. But, hick, what should anyone expect from auto-centric Los Angeles.",RDHOnTheGo
50,It Works,"I took the Metro Rail on several occasions to various places and it always worked out well. I came across nothing sketchy or unsafe during my rides, and I say this as a New Yorker ; ). Get a TAP Day Pass if you plan on hopping on and off a lot...which you will, so do.",Nicola M
40,The new Metro Expo Line,"If you're staying on the Westside of Los Angeles and would like to have the full Metro experience while seeing the sights hop on the new Metro Expo Line. Get on at one of the Culver City elevated stations and enjoy the panoramic view of LA - Century City, the Hollywood Sign, LA's downtown skyscrapers. You can get off at the Exposition Park stop and enjoy the world class museums found there and soon to be the home of the Shuttle. Then on to downtown with all of its historic & cultural sites. While you're on any of the Metro lines be sure to check out the great public art at the stations and along the rail paths. It's unique, inexpensive and a fun way to see Los Angeles.",Patricia P
50,"Convenient, on time and safe","Having never been on a subway before, I had no idea on what to expect. Los Angeles metro offers such a convenient service. Trains on the more popular lines (red and blue lines) come about every ten minutes. $5 gets you a 24hr pass, for unlimited rides on all metro trains and buses within the city, which you buy from an automated machine that takes card and cash. There is the occasional homeless person asking for change, but it's no big deal. You see some pretty interesting people in the subways. The stations are surprisingly clean and safe and each has its own theme. The Hollywood/vine station is nice.If you've never experienced a subway station before, I'd recommend Los Angeles subways, especially the Hollywood/Vine and Hollywood/Highland stations.",Brian T
40,Buy Passes to Save!,"Had to be one of the easier metros to get around in. Things were so well done, that I basically was able to stay on the Metro Red Line. My hotel was less than half a block from a Metro Red Line station, and pretty much everything we needed was on the Red Line. We did transfer to the Blue Line when we needed to get to the LA Convention Center (for the Pico stop). Just really well laid out system. The cost of the metro isn't bad either.Only thing about the metro here, that I didn't find I had much, if any, of a problem in other places is the amount of crazies that hang out in these stations. Fortunately, I traveled with my husband. But honestly, if I traveled by myself, I'd feel a bit nervous about it all.To get around LA though, this is good bang for your buck. Buy a $5 day pass, or if you're there for a week or more buy a $20 seven day pass. Definitely got our monies worth out of the seven day pass here.",MukuSix
40,Riding the rails and subway in Los Angeles,"This was the first time I had an opportunity to ride the rails and subway in Los Angeles. I've been planning this trip in my mind for years now. I wanted to go and see where I could go and what I could see on the Metro in Los Angeles. Specifically, each Metro stop is its own unique art museum Most of them have beautiful murals and sculptures of that depict the life of Angelinos. I was glad to give up driving at least for a day and let the subway take me to see what Los Angeles had to offer.I flew down to Southern California from San Francisco and found the connector bus to the Green Line at LAX. It delivered me to the Aviation and 105 station where I purchased a $5 day pass. The hotel who figures out the way to market themselves as Metro accessible will become a big winner. I boarded the train head south to Redondo Beach where I was staying for a couple of days. I walked from the end of the line at Redondo Beach to my hotel. I learned later that taking the bus down Aviation to Artesia was probably a better move. Still I walked to the place I was going to be spending the next couple days.After I checked-in and dropped of my bags, I walked east on Artesia trying to get back to the Green Line on Marine. I saw a couple of people waiting on a bus. I walked up and asked if the bus went to the Green Line. They weren't for sure. So I crossed to the north side of the street where a few more people were waiting for the bus going in the opposite direction. They didn't know if the bus went to the Green line either.I waited 'til the bus arrived and asked the driver if the bus was going anywhere near the the Green Line. She said, ""yes, there was a stop a block away from her route on Douglas."" I gladly paid the fair, jumped on and bus traveled north on the route I took to walk to the place I would be staying. I was really anxious to get back to the Green Line so that I could get on and experience what it was like to not drive in Los Angeles.The bus delivered me to the El Segundo/Nash Street Green Line Station. I had my $5 pass in my sweaty shirt pocket and my cameras in tow. As I approached the El Segundo/Nash Street Station a train from the south was approaching. I pulled out my camera and snapped a quick shot. I was trying to make that same train but I think it left me but I didn't mind because I believed the trains run frequently in the afternoon.Finally my train arrived and I was whisked away down the center of 105 towards the Blue Line. It was fast. I saw cars waiting in traffic as the made their way towards downtown and many other destinations. I had to go to the Blue Line because it runs north/south between Los Angels and Long Beach. I anxiously arrived at the Wilmington/105 stop. I jumped off and went down stairs to the platform and waited for the train going north to Los Angeles from Long Beach. I believe the south bound train for Long Beach arrived first. I was surprised that the Metro had three trains connected. I don't remember seeing a system with three trains at once. As the train pulled into the station, I saw why they had three cars. The Blue Line car going south to Long Beach was rather crowded.A few moments later, the north bound Los Angeles train arrived. Three cars again. And again, the amount of human traffic warranted the three cars. I was very excited to finally get a chance to ride the Metro to downtown Los Angeles. It was something I had not been able to do when I lived there several years ago. As we headed north, I made a mental note of the stops. I wanted to see the Watts Tower. I mistakenly thought the Watts Tower was on a stop on the way to downtown. I discovered later that it was a stop or two south of intersection of the Blue and Green Lines.It was good to see the rail system being used by many Southern Californians. It was always in my mind to try to navigate some of Los Angeles by public transportation. It took me to a good number of the places I wanted to photograph and some places I had never been while I lived there like East L.A. On the way to El Mariachi Plaza and the Soto Station I noticed some beautiful murals at Little Tokyo that I wanted to photograph. Unfortunately time wasn't on my side. I was thankful for the time it saved in trying to find somewhere to park. I spent half of this trip--one full day--on public transportation--and the other half driving. I can say that the public transport day was more productive than the day of driving. I was able to go to Hollywood & Vine and take those shots everyone loves to take. I ran into Los Angeles' infamous traffic trying to go up to Malibu to shoot El Matador. The 405 or I should say the traffic on west bound Santa Monica Blvd trying to get on the 405 made this impossible.The only complaint I have about the Metro in Los Angeles is that I wish it was expand sooner rather than later.",circa1806
50,Best for getting around LA,"I spent 2 days driving to and from LA, mostly sitting in traffic. Then I discovered the Metro Card! Bought a 1 day pass for $5 and rode all day. Went to several neighborhoods, following the posted map. The areas are clean and I felt safe. The card can be used on the Metro bus's also, but they are crowded and it takes a lot longer to travel above ground, streets are very congested, however you can see a lot of famous sites. Saves on parking hassles and potential parking tickets.",MiaRoller
40,handy,"very handy from the beverly garland hotel we stayed at,10 minute walk to metro, quick to get to the hollywood blvd., $2 one way, safe. took city bus back to hotel so we didn't have to walk back from metro to hotel, bus stop is right in front of hotel.",soup154
40,Easy way to get around,"Cheap and easy way to get around - doesnt go to all places in LA (apparently due to Earthquake issues) but handy for the ones it does go to. Dont be tempted to not buy tickets (my family kept daring me to live dangerously) - even though you seem to be able to get on and off without showing tickets on our very last ride there were Sheriffs at our last stop to check them - cost of ticket $1.50 each - cost of fine for not having one $750.00! My family stopped giving me grief about being a ""nana"" after they saw this",Tracey M
50,$5 a day - great price,Wished there was more rail going out to Santa MonicaFantastic to get on and go to Downtown LA then change for other locationsUsed buses to go from Hollywood to Citadel outlets and then ran into some locals who recommended catching the Gold line back to Downtown then the Red line to Hollywood - so easy,joanne t
50,subways in L.A.?,"they are clean and very artsy. Easy to use. recommend you buy the all day ticket, it will save you money. In Hollywood you can get off at one stop walk down sunset seeing all the sights and board at the next stop. Parking at universal and spend the day sightseeing by subway.",Stephen K
40,"It doesn't go everywhere, but it's a good way to get around Hollywood","Living near a Red Line stop, I ride the Metro anytime I need to go, well, anywhere it stops. The trains are reliable, cleaner than most rail systems, far less stressful than driving and cheaper than parking. I even take the train to Long Beach when I'm going over to Catalina or visiting the Queen Mary. The only drawback is that they don't go everywhere.",Lindsikins
50,Excellent way to get around the city,"The metro rail and bus in LA is brilliant. Clean, tidy and safe no matter what time of day you are travelling. I had no bother getting around and you really do not need a car, unless you are travelling futher afield.The $6 day ticket is great for travelling about and if you are in Santa Monica, can be upgraded to the Blue Bus for $1.",steph3011
