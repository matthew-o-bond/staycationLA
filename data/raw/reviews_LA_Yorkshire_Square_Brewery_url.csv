50,Great beer and a great vibe!,Fantastic brewery in the South Bay. Great ambience with helpful staff and the beer is fantastic! Lots of variety plus they have wine and cider available too. A gem in Old Town Torrance and a worthy stop on any brewery tour of the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachelkP3946IL
50,Excellent find for craft beer & great food,"This craft brewery was a super find in LA. Their Early Doors beer was very similar to Tetley’s in the UK. Try the flights of beer where you can decide what to try & @ $8 for 4 glasses it’s really good value.We came when they had just launched their food and the Yorkshire pudding wraps are definitely worth a go.Great vibe, lots of “Yorkshire” and British quirky memorabilia and one of the few places with a beer garden so you can drink outside",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MmeWorthington
