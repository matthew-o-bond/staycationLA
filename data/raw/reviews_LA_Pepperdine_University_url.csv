50,Zoey 101,"After our beach visit in Malibu, we wanted to go see nearby Pepperdine University. The main reason we wanted to see it was because one of the kids’ favorite TV shows from when they were younger was filmed there. That show was Zoey 101, starring Britney’s younger sister Jamie Lyn Spears. It was nice to see some of the buildings from the old show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HOCKPOOH

Welcomed by a tall crucifix beacon it was a pleasant stroll from the roadside bus stop.We got chatting to some of the students who were most welcoming and friendly. It was interesting to hear some of their insights into their studies on such gorgeous academia.We admired impressive architecture that blends so well with the environment. Within the Payson Library is an interesting compact exhibition that features an imposing St. John's Bible.We traversed the amphitheatre on the way to the beautiful Beverly Stauffer Chapel that has marvellous luminous stained glass. Smothers Theatre is another attractive build.The Mullin Town Square is a pleasant meeting place and there was quite a throughput of students criss-crossing it.There is a fascinating exhibition in the Weisman Museum of Art.

40,Views from Heroes Garden,"When in Malibu, the Pepperdine campus is nice to drive around, picturesque for its views, & a perfect spot to picnic on its immense ""front lawn"". But, take a moment to drive to the top & visit Heroes Garden next to the business school. Views are the best, some of the highest in Malibu without being deep into the mountains. The fountain runs along the walk path and pools at an infinity edge reflecting pond. Worth the visit; you can see across the ocean for miles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reyc632
50,"Gorgeous views, lovely campus","Wow, I had seen pictures of this lovely campus, but driving up and walking around campus proved why students LOVE attending college here. As visitors from an affiliate church, we loved attending the worship service and shout out to pastor Eric!--you captivated and kept our attention with your spot-on, life-application message.Quite impressive was the USA flag(s) display to 911 victims, which continued down one block and around another, including a few flags aptly representing other nationalities of victims.

40,Campus with a view!,"We have been to Pepperdine many times to attend the annual Bible Lectures in May. There is a beautiful outdoor swimming pool and hot tub, tennis courts, a running track to name just a few things you can do. The buildings and lecture halls are lovely, the cafeteria grand with views and outdoor patios on 2 sides! The chapel has some gorgeous stained glass and wood work. There is a Starbucks on campus now and a beautiful new library. It is on the hillsides overlooking the Pacific in Malibu and not far from the Getty Villa, Malibu Mart, surfing and beach combing and more.

It also appeared that it was a long trip to get to any kind of store or restaurant that isn't campus related.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S463LQmikee
50,"Beautiful, but be prepared for steep climbs","The Pepperdine campus is beautiful, but absolutely nothing is on the same level. Be prepared for many, many stairs if you want to see the whole University.

50,So much more than a degree,"My wife was a sophomore at this campus the first year it opened. She took me here for the first time late on a Friday afternoon in 1978. I was blown away! Driving in on Malibu Canyon Road we stopped & watched a filming of the TV show, ""M.A.S.H"". Then I saw the unparalleled beauty of this campus! Having already earned an advanced degree, after having attended a community college, a Cal Poly, & 2 Cal States, I proclaimed that I would still be struggling thru freshman Chemistry had I attended Pepperdine because I would never have been able to go to class in this gorgeous setting. Over the years we've attended alumni functions, etc. She's watched the campus grow. For our 40th anniversary, I wanted to bring my once coed back to her undergrad alma mater again. While the campus's beauty continues to impress me, it's what Pepperdine did for my wife that I will always cherish. Sure, the collegiate experience of watching movies & TV shows being filmed (she showed me where Jim Rockford's trailer sat!), sitting near yesteryear's megastar's at the local theatre, and the beaches . . . Wow, those beaches! . . . all that was great. But while I was wallowing in college debauchery, she was having her family instilled values reinforced at a faith based University that ultimately had a profound impact on her future husband. This place offers so much more than just beautiful scenery & a degree!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lesj835

50,Pepperdine U - A Stunning Campus above the Pacific,"Driving through Pepperdine University on the weekend is an unforgettable experience. A beautiful campus overlooking Malibu and the Pacific Ocean, it's worth driving and parking to take in the vistas as well as the gorgeous campus facilities, particularly the filed house, pool area, and sports fields. Drive higher up to the Law School and even the vistas extend further. The ALUMNI PARK and the lower lakes are also nice to walk around, especially on a typically perfect day when the temperature is about 78 degrees.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G2172VAandyg

50,A School With A View!,"Unfortunately, much of the Malibu coast is not easy to get to, or to see. Yes, there are public beaches, though much of the coast is blocked by homes or private communities. There are lots of great shops and restaurants in Malibu, and the canyons (Topanga, Las Virgenes/Malibu, and Kanan) offer great access and stunning views.A great stop is at Pepperdine University. Whether you have an interest in the school or not as a parent or student, it's worth the stop. Plan on 15-20 minutes to drive the circle drive around campus minimum. A 1-2 hour stop includes much more.Pepperdine is on the hill overlooking the ocean. It is a perennial top school on the most beautiful campus lists. You will frequently see deer eating grass on the many spacious lawns. (At night there are mountain lions in the hills nearby, and though sited, they keep their distance.)Main campus is great for a stop. Tell the guards at the guard gate that you want to go to the student store or the Waves Cafe for a meal, and they'll instruct you on parking (which is limited). It's not busy, you get a token for the lot; if it's busy, you will get a pass and park on the road that circles campus or one of the outlying lots. The chapel is at the base of main (central) campus. Lots of great lawns on campus to rest, picnic, or fly a Frisbee! Campus is on a hill, so wear comfy walking shoes.Main campus also has classrooms, theaters (with lots of evening events), galleries, Payson Library, and many of the places seen on the famous ""Zoey 101"" television shot which was shot on campus.The Law School is higher up the hill, as is the Drescher Campus housing the Graziadio Graduate Business School. Don't miss a stop at the top. Take a few minutes (or longer) to visit Heroes Garden, a beautiful garden in tribute to Thomas E. Burnett, Jr., and the others from the famous Flight 93 ""Let's Roll"" heroes from 9/11. I visit this place often, for its stunning views and peaceful atmosphere. It is at the very top of the Malibu Campus.From Pepperdine you can head north up the coast or south to Santa Monica via Pacific Coast Highway, or east through Malibu Canyon over to Highway 101, so it's a great point in the North West of Los Angeles to stop by and see or visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OBillyHill
50,incredible!!,I highly recommend going to Pepperdine even if you are already passed the college age. My family went on a tour and we were amazed by the campus.

50,Must see Waves of Flags Display Honoring 9/11 Victims,"Every year Pepperdine University honors the victims of 9/11 with a flag display on their front lawn. Each victim is represented by a full size flag and to see the display is something else. It puts the sheer magnitude of the lives lost that day into perspective as the flags cover the hills of the university located just off highway 1. They usually are left up for a two week period so if you have the chance to make it out to Malibu during this time, I would highly recommend it. Parking is free alongside the university and the best days to go are during the week as it's less crowded. At night, the flags are lit which creates a very humbling solemn experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
40,The location and views are amazing.,No comment about the university as we have not attended. But the grounds are lovely. Spend your first time up at Heroes Garden at the very top of the university. Its next to the B school. From here you have a hawk's view of Malibu like no other public-accessible site. The inverted fountain (water had been turned off during the drought) is lovely as it is in the ground leading to an infinity pond with commanding views south and east. From here drive down to the massive grass lawn that fronts PCH and take a picnic. Dogs and children can walk and run to their hearts delight. Don't be surprised to see deer grazing on the grass at times. Park along Bankowsky Rd on Pepperdine's campus for this area so you won't have to be exposed to traffic from the main roads. There are concrete benches to relax and take it all in if you wish. Around Sept 11 the university has its Flag memorial which is a sight unto itself.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reyc632

Pepperdine was selected as the set for the fictional Pacific Coast Academy in the TV series Zoey 101.As amazing as it is to look up at Pepperdine from the coast, it is (not surprisingly) even more spectacular to view the coast from Pepperdine. The University is built on various tiers, with athletic fields down below, the main campus in the middle and then additional classrooms and dorms up higher.

The BEST. When you drive up to the guard shack, just tell them you want to visit. They are very nice. You can walk all over the campus, their amazing pools, their beautiful lawns - all of which have the most incredible views of the Pacific you have ever seen or will ever see. Unless you live in the Pacific Palisades, and in that case, why are you reading this review?They have a chapel on the edge of a hillside which would have stunning views, but it also has beautiful stained glass windows, so you can't see the view while inside. Very intelligent design, so that worshippers won't be distracted. Pray, then go outside to look at the incredible view.Professors, or at least the law professors, receive housing at Pepperdine. Housing! Freaking Malibu housing. Because I'm a moron, I mentally mocked them when I was at school. Now that I'm in the real world, I'm thinking I should be a professor just to live at Pepperdine and wake up to those gorgeous views and on that incredible property. Visit.

The museum is a small one, a few rooms on two floors, but the exhibit was terrific, and we learned some things about Warhol not generally known. It even motivated us to go out and buy some Campbell's soup.The campus itself is beautiful and unusual, built up the sides of the canyons in Malibu right along the Pacific. The views are stunning. To enter the parking lot at the museum and the adjacent performing arts center, you must obtain a token from the guard at the gatehouse entrance to the campus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WestSideKid
40,Eddy D. Field Stadium,"Came to Pepperdine for a baseball series. The baseball stadium is great. Lots of seating, and it's all general admission. Parking is free. The folks who work there are very friendly and helpful. Scorecards are free and provided in help-yourself style in a big stack behind the press box. You get to sit and watch a baseball game while also enjoying the view of palm trees, mountains, and the Pacific Ocean. It's a beautiful setting for a ballpark. The one negative I could mention is that there are no seats in the shade (and the park doesn't have lights, so there are only day games). A good number of people brought large umbrellas to provide shade.I also walked and drove around the campus. The campus itself is, once again, in a beautiful setting. Set on a hill overlooking the ocean. Lots of palm trees. But it's almost as if the builders thought, ""This setting is so pretty, we don't really need interesting or diverse architecture."" The buildings are all drab office-looking buildings and they all look the same. the most interesting-looking architecture at Pepperdine is the large Phillips Theme Tower. If you're going to be walking around, know that it is very hilly and you are going to be climbing lots of stairs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/txag08

40,Weisman Museum and Performing Arts Center,We attended the Weisman Museum for the Andy Warhol exhibition. The museum is nice but small and appears to be completely dedicated to whatever the current topic is. We really liked the exhibition. In past years we've been to the performing arts center to see acapella groups. We thought the performances and venue to be very nice.After seeing the Warhol we wondered about the campus a little (it's on a hill so everything is up or down) the campus is just gorgeous with wonderful views of the ocean. It is enjoyable just to wonder around.Generally you can park for free in a lower parking lot on the weekends and they appear to provide a shuttle up to the museum and performing arts center. However to park at the theater and museum level they charge (about $7).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_MTJ_99

50,...Freely Give,"Yes, it looks just like the postcard. Faculty and staff go the extra mile and genuinely want to help. The motto states that Pepperdine's mission is to strengthen students for lives of service, purpose, and leadership. Its motto (visible everywhere) is ""Freely ye have received, freely give."" The Heroes Garden (9/11 Memorial) at the Drescher Campus (Business Grad school) here is poignantly understated and beautiful. Although Pepperdine has turned off its water features because of the drought (the beautiful lawn is from reclaimed water), it's still worth visiting. Simple quotations etched in rocks surround what is usually a running stream into an infinity pool overlooking the ocean. Tranquil and does not exploit Pepperdine's relationship with one of the 9/11 heroes (Burnett), but pays quiet tribute to every victim of the attack.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MalibuMomma

We visited during the week between Christmas and New Year, so there was really no activity on campus, but we enjoys driving through and seeing it.

From the quality of education, to the safe and secure setting that is Seaver College in Malibu, the excellent weather, the caring faculty and the unbelievable opportunities that my education has provided for me. As a teacher, each time I send a student to Pepperdine I am thrilled that they get to revel in their own Malibu experience. Even if attending the school is not in the cards for you, it is worth a visit, on a clear day you can see all the way to Catalina Island, running the track every 1/8th of a mile you get the view of a life time, attend a baseball game and have fun watching the action with the Pacific Ocean in the background.

We went up to the top to Heros Memorial park I think it was called, really nice with a killers view of the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonnyru49

50,Unbelievable University,"The best time to go by Pepperdine is close to September 11, when they pay tribute to those who lost their lives in 9/11.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1222JeffK
50,Cafeteria has better view that most expensive restaurants,"The little restuarants around campus are nice, but the cafeteria has such an amazing view and good food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aledo99
50,A beautiful top notch campus.,"The campus has a very good academic curriculum and sits a top of a hill overlooking the Malibu ocean. I used to teach there as a part-time college Professor over 18 years ago. The campus always remain the same--pristine, peaceful and academically challenging. You can take a visitor's tour of the campus to see it's beauty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/305HeatherM
50,Very pretty campus,Beautiful green campus overlooking the ocean. Nice to drive by.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PK001
50,Nicest campus in the world?,"I went to school here so I'm biased, but I have to say I think it's the nicest setting in the world. Tripadvisor seems like a bizarre place to review university academics so I won't do that, but if you're driving through Malibu and particularly if you have a 16 year old pre-college-student with you, take a tour and enjoy the view!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasonjarvis
50,Hero's Monument,"This is a beautiful spot to reflect on those who gave their lives on Flight 93 on 9/11. Parking is difficult, we had to take turns staying with the car, but it is uplifting to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/compulvisetraveler
30,very pretty to see but really nothing to do,"If you're looking for a 10-15 drive as you take Highway 1 north out of LA towards Ventura and Santa Barbara, you can drive around the campus which is quite scenic with fabulous views of the ocean, but in reality, this is simply a typical college campus with little to do, little to see and nothing to justify getting out of the car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pandpCalifornia
50,Tommy Emmanuel at Pepperdine,"What an amazingly beautiful place, this university. I attended a concert at the Smothers Theater and had a chance to walk the grounds waiting for my sister to show up and have dinner. I had been there previously for graduation ceremonies a few yewars ago but did not get the opportunity to visit the other end of the campus. I was at the Library, near the chapel, and close to the museum adn didn't want to close my eyes as the view was southern California at it's best. Breezy and cool, colored sky which defies description, clean and gorgeous campus, in spite of the academic and fraternity flyers everywhere. the architecture is subtile and I cannot imagine being young and trying to study in those surroundings! But that's my shortcoming!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oleoiam
40,Unbelievable Concert by Tommy Emmanuelle,"This Australian guitar master wowed the audience with a superb performance showing why he is the master of the guitar. Entertaining, non-stop performance that you would swear was an entire band if you closed your eyes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aussieonyak

50,GORGEOUS CAMPUS - OMG NOT SURE IF I COULD FOCUS ON SCHOOL HERE,"While in Malibu with the kids, we figured let's take a little stroll around the campus and wonder about how fantastic it would be to go to school across from the beach at this absolutely stunning college campus. After attending great schools on the east coast (and enjoying every minute of college life) I'm not sure we would've had the discipline to stay off the beach and in class. But anywho, if you visit Malibu take some time to walk the campus and inhale all the fresh ocean air, take in all the beauty of the campus and enjoy life in Malibu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldTravelSnob
50,Hard not to Love,"Pepperdine University stole my heart when I visited the law school in April 2003. Until then, I had made up my mind to attend Vanderbilt University Law School and had even put a deposit on an apartment in Nashville. On a whim, I bought a plane ticket and flew from Penn State to California for Pepperdine's Admitted Students Day. By the end of the day I knew that Pepperdine was where I wanted to spend the next three years of my life! It's a beautiful beautiful campus, but even more important is its incredible sense of community not to mention the friendly and kind people who work and live there. If you ever have a chance to visit California be sure to take a trip up Los Angeles and if you ever have a chance to visit Los Angeles, you'd be silly not to head over to Malibu and see one of the most gorgeous college campuses in the nation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Road11140
