20,nothing to see here except a gate,"Take my advice, don't bother. All you'll do is make the residents and the neighbors mad, and you won't see anything at all. When Madonna owned this house it was painted very distinctly and you could get a good look at it from a distance. Now, who cares? She hasn't lived there in many years and you can't see anything anyway. Stay away!",JohnRyan724
