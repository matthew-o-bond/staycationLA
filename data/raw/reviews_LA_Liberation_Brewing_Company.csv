50,Fun brew variety in an open space,"Our ""breweries to visit"" list was probably too ambitious for a short weekend visit, but I'm glad we were able to stop in at Liberation. We were wondering if this was a newer spot, as there were only three other people hanging out when we arrived on a Saturday afternoon. By the time we left, the employees outnumbered the customers, which seems odd for a brewery/taproom of any kind.I, of course, went with a flight, and my husband surprised me by also getting a flight.Flight number one consisted of: Mostly Harmless (a cream ale; it had a nice fizz to balance out the smooth palate feel, and some good, subtle flavors); Just Like Honey (an English bitter; it smelled like butterscotch and tasted a bit like candy on my first sip. There was an earthy, almost herbal flavor that lingered on my palate. One of my favorites sampled that day); Father's Shout (a sweet milk stout; they promised bittersweet chocolate, pecans, and sweet cream, but all I noticed was the bittersweet chocolate).Flight number two consisted of: Simon Saison Peach (the peach aroma wafted off this one, which made it an inviting beverage. The peach flavor is subtle enough to not overwhelm the palate, adding a nice touch of sweetness); Maddy (an American Pale Ale; it had fruity notes without being overly fruity, and tended toward the IPA side without having the overly hoppy/bitter IPA tones); John Brown Ale (American Brown Ale; I really enjoyed the nutty flavor and aroma. It's the first nut brown where the nuttiness cuts out the coffee).My husband liked his flight and promptly got a pint of the Just Like Honey. He finished the night with a pint of the Roy G Biv IPA.The building is large, with lots of seating at the bar, at the picnic tables and at the smaller tables in the corner. They have a gaming area and offer several board games. Confusingly, they were projecting the video game Contra onto the wall, but there didn't seem to be a way to actually play the game, as no controllers or system could be found.The bathroom was gigantic and clean. They could probably fit three more toilets in that space and still have enough room for sinks and people.This was a good find, and we briefly discussed grabbing a few crowlers to take home with us. Maybe next time.",SimeyTravels
20,Disappointed,"Came in ready to kick back for a few hours and down some brew. Across the street from Bake & Broil (my favorite breakfast spot). Tried several brews and was disappointed with every one.Brewery is large and air-conditioned (two big pluses).No problem with parking (in back). Plenty of seating. Games too. BUT, I came for the beer. Won't be back.",baaaaaaa
40,There is a brand-new brewer in town,"Liberation Brewing Co is a brand-new brewery in a fairly large building on Atlantic Ave Long Beach, opposite Bake and Boil. They have off street parking round back but have not change the parking stalls names from last business that was there staff are very friendly and still give free small tastes of their limited choice of beer. We tried the amber and the cream ale very nice, and the pale ale had not to a hoppy smell or overpowering taste of hops. Unfortunately, all too often California Breweries crank up the hop taste in their IPS. Which by the way stands for India PALE ale and in Britain is a light beer, hence the name PALE. I have found the besides Belgium Wits, I like the more lighter taste of old school Heffenwieser, but unfortunately they did not have any brewed yet. Which I find strange as its the fastest beer to brew, (about a week) Like all breweries they do not serve food but carry a good rang of potato crisps.They also seem to be dog friendly. We usually go to Ten Mile but will be defiantly be coming back to see whatâ€™s new, so nice to have the choice of two good brewers in townTIP: Check their opening times before you go they have select days of service at the moment.",Michael B
