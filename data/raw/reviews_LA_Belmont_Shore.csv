It is a little ""touristy"" in a local sense, but not like Venice or Santa Monica touristy. It is right by the most beautiful water views, and you can stroll down 2nd St with many interesting places to visit. Unlike a tourist trap like the Pike, some of the restaurants here are top notch, namely Nick's on 2nd and Roe. Sushi on Fire is very good as well, although not as good as the one in Huntington Beach. Once you get to the end, you can cross the bridge and see the many boats and stroll over to Naples Island, where beautiful mansions sit on canals. Michael's on Naples is a top ten LA restaurant and probably my most favorite in all of Los Angeles and I have been around!

10,Site for the Fakest and Worst People You'll meet,Belmont shore is in my opinion the worst area to be. Take it from someone who has lived here my whole life (i am currently 18 about to graduate high school and am getting out of here). My whole life living here has been the worst. you will be lucky to find decent people to talk to and befriend. I understand that people are drawn to this area because of the coast and the beach life but i think that you would be better off up in venice beach or santa monica (i currently live here part time). belmont shore is not a healthy enviornment. it is filled with the most fake and rude people you could ever meet. all of the adults who live there don't have anything better to do with their lives other than to gossip about kids. Do not visit belmont shore. It will not be a good or nice time for you.,anonymous_0900

Have eaten in a lot of the restaurants with fairly good results. Indian, Greek, Mid-Eastern, Italian (mostly pizza), Down Home food are all there.

50,the Shore,"Belmont Shore is a little neighborhood that is part of greater Long Beach. Second Street is lined with all kinds of eateries and shops. Many of these places are independently owned, but over the years, more and more ""chains"" have taken over. Gap, Banana Republic, Starbucks, Coffee Bean, Papyrus, and more have diminished the charm of the Shore, but it's still a great place to walk, be near the beach, eat, shop, and enjoy life. Dog friendly. The one and only big complaint I have about Second Street is that most of the shops and even some of the eateries do not have a restroom - even for customers! I find this appalling given that many people are visiting the area and will eventually need to use the facilities. To not have restrooms for customers seems a bit harsh. I understand that establishments want to avoid having their restrooms monopolized by the transient population, but to refuse a customer use of the restroom is just ridiculous. Otherwise, Belmont Shore is a wonderful place to stroll.",Karin W

30,Not What it Used to Be,"I do still love many restaurants on 2nd street in Belmont Shore (La Strada is a favorite; we love George's Greek Cafe; and when in the mood for Mexican, Super Mex simply cannot be beat!), but the parking is tough to negotiate, and the walk up and down has gotten a bit...er....scurvy in the past few years. The parades are often fun, the Christmas decorations are a wonderful eyeful, but with a bit of a druggie beach culture taking over...some of the people on the streets can be a bit, er...disturbing in dress and mannerisms.With that said - if you are an open-minded person, no worries! As an adult with grown kids, it does not really bother me overmuch, but if someone had impressionable children and they were concerned with some visuals, maybe they'd prefer something else.Many of the stores have very touristy-things for sale, and almost all are quite high in price. I do like to ooh-and-aah over some of the items, but do not purchase here because they can generally be found for lower prices elsewhere.If you're coming to enjoy a long stroll, be prepared to stop at multiple streetlights on the very short blocks. Running-quickly-unrestrained-toddlers may be in danger, so plan accordingly!Younger unsupervised teens may be able to meet up with people willing to sell them things that you don't want your unsupervised teens to purchase, so again - plan accordingly.There is a lively bar scene at night, and again, parking is often difficult to find. But - with all that said, it is a classic beachy place to go.",Alisa G

It is also within walking distance to the beach. You can rent a kayak to circle around the canal and look at some nice houses.",SLoh_11
50,"Lovely place to run, walk, skate board, bicycle, or even walk the dog","This is my favorite spot in SoCal for running log runs. I like to go early in the morning before the sun comes up but I also love late mornings when there are more people.The Shoreline Village area is very quaint with lots of nice shops and places to get coffee. Also nice restaurants - but for leisure you probably would not visit those.Parking at Shoreline Village can get expensive - for just over 2 hours it cost $10 in the lot, but if you choose street parking with meters it's coins, and might cost up to $1.25 for a 2 hour period. That's a big difference. The earlier you get there the more street parking there will be, and you can park anyplace in the Downtown area.I like to park near the peninsula which is about 3.5 miles from the Village. There's metered street parking and even some free spots. Also the lots over there are not as expensive, and they are self-pay.The paths here are wonderful. Bikers have a different path than walkers/runners (they are parallel one another), and both are nice and wide PLUS they are level! This is very important for runners, since slanted paths can be hard on the knees, ankles, and hips when running for long periods.I use Belmont paths for running mileage between 7 and 14 miles. If I park way down by the peninsula I can run all the way past the Queen Mary to the entrance of the Riverbed path, then back and that's just at 14 miles.When I park at Shoreline Village or near there, I run toward the peninsula then back. If I have time afterward, I like to go to the little coffee place on the back side of the village that overlooks the water - it's very nice and I enjoy that as a personal reward for a good run.The places you will pass on a long run as described above are; the Piers, Queen Mary, the Aquarium, Downtown Long Beach city shopping, Shoreline Village, the Light House, the boat docks, and a lot of great scenery, too. If you run very early in the morning you can run right through the outdoor restaurant areas along the water, it's really nice. That's if you run toward the Lighthouse instead of the beach area.Another great plus is that, for long runs especially, there are toilets and drinking fountains. I don't have to carry a water bottle for those extra long runs, it's built in all along the path. Beach rest rooms are typically stainless steel unisex, then there are other public washrooms in Shoreline village, too.I also come here to watch the Grunion runs late at night. If you look at the calendars for these tiny, protected fish, you can see them for yourself. Until I took part in a research project about them, I thought they were a myth! but they come ashore here in Belmont by the thousands at certain times of the year, and it's quite entertaining.",bonitadc

Unfortunately, over the last years, so have other people; so it can be a little congested. Belmont Shore has many personalities. It has Second Street, a hub of boutiques, restaurants, trendy shops, sidewalk cafes and bars. Second Street also sponsors events such as Stroll & Savor where one gets a chance to eat a sampler of all the restaurants up and down at a minimal price; it also has Sidewalk Sales and Sidewalk Art, and Classic Car Shows annually. Then there is the beach and the bay- off of Ocean Blvd. It is possible to rent kayaks, SUPs, sailboats, and paddle boats and explore the bay and the canals of Naples Island. Families can also pitch a gazebo on the beach and swim and have a picnic all day. I love this town so much that I walk to the bank, drug store, market, and everywhere else.

50,"Fun place to look, shop and eat, without a mall","I take the bus from downtown (#121) and go to almost Naples - then walk back to close to the Belmont Pier. There are all sorts of restaurants, bars, shops, banks, etc. that appeal to both locals and tourists. It's easy to get around, people are helpful to give you an idea where things are, and if you've checked out things in the literature about Long Beach, you'll have lots to find. Try it, you'll like it.",lindalindabm

50,Long Beach/Belmont Shore - an honest review from a prior resident,"I absolutely LOVE Belmont Shore and Long Beach. I was lucky enough, or perhaps even blessed, to have had the chance to live in paradise and I would move back there, from the San Francisco bay area in a heartbeat. There is so much to do, so many places to eat, live music, cultural diversity, the beach, and the best part is it is not over run by tourists. It is charming and quaint, yet, has an airport and the Port of Los Angeles calls it home. You can Cruise to Catalina Island on an Express for the day, or, plan a vacation to Mexico with Catalina Island being one of the ports of call and be at the port in 10 minutes or less. What can I say, I miss my old stomping grounds....a lot!!! Enjoy, I hope you love it as much as i do.",Ironqween
50,"Shopping, great restaurants and the beach too!","Belmont Shore is a half mile of lots-to-do. Great restaurants and bars on every block. Great shopping for shoes, clothes, gifts and stationary. Did I say ice cream and frozen yogurt? Park at one end and ""walk the shore"". My nieces, from the east coast, beg to do this every visit. And then there is the beach along Bayshore drive, hang out or rent a kayak and paddle around the island of Naples and its canals. Great way to spend a summers day.",luvs2fly246

50,A Great Place to Stroll Around,"A fantastic place to stroll around on a nice day to visit the shops, restaurants, bars and just to people watch. You are only a few blocks from the water if you decide to walk down there. Fantastic restaurants to choose from.",PatrickLongBeach
40,Used to be quaint,"I lived in Belmont shores for 8 years and enjoyed the quaintness of this town, but lately it started to get too crowded. Parking is always a hassle but then if you lived there, once you park your car, you don't have to move it until you went back to work the next day. Everything is within walking distance and there are great restaurants along the Main Street.",myfaironepb
50,Very nice area!!!,Belmont Shore is a long street with restaurants and bars. At the end of Belmont Shore you’ll get to Naples Island.

50,Long Beach's showplace beach community,"Back when I lived here, 30 years ago, Belmont Shore was the place to go to hang out after work; the bar scene was active, and the restaurants were pretty good. Have to say that it's grown up a bit in the years since; the restaurants, at least many of them, are world class and the bar scene is a bit more muted. It's a very active area, lots of people on the street, and the feeling is pretty upscale. Legend's sports bar hasn't changed too much, though, maybe 20 different sporting events going on all over the place! If you can, go there on a sunny weekend day.",DonaldYokum
50,THIS IS A MUST EXPERIENCE,"Belmont Shore is a cross between a little beach town and a European city centre.

50,A Great Community,"Belmont Shore is the best of Long Beach. There is 2nd Street which has really great restaurants and stores to shop in. It is a great place to walk at night after a nice meal. I particularly like George's Greek Deli on 2nd. The community is very much ""old California"" and strolling around the neighborhoods takes you to a much quieter and more specific period of California history. I love the access to the beach as well, which is near the beach walk/run path which is fantastic. This a great place to spend a day beachcombing, walking, biking or just hanging out.",Jon M
