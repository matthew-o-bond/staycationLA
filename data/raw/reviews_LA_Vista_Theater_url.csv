30,Traitors,"This historical theater, has cement in front of it's entrance, with various celebrities hand and footprints and signatures. It is located in the Silver Lake Area, now home to the legendary Vampira. Elvira Stole her entire persona, claimed it as her own creation and has made millions. Vampira (Maila Nurmi) has little money, for her persona was stolen. This theater, mere blocks from Vampira's home, has the hand and foot prints of Elvira in it's cement. A travesty to history. An insult toa legend.",
50,Great theater with great sound.,"This movie theater is definately one of the old Movie Palaces from days long past. Oddly the outside of the Vista gives the impression that it is small and modest. Walk through the doors into the theater itself though and you'll see just how modest the outside facade truelly is. The inside has a wonderful egyptian theme with giant pharroes supporting the roof above, along with red carpeting and about 6 feet between you and the room in front of you. Oh, and did I mention the hard wood floors?!The theater is also equiped with a top of the line sound system. I see all of the big name action movies there because I know I'll get the biggest bang (literally) for my buck.",

The one big plus previous reviewers have not mentioned, however, are the ticket prices. Matinees of major first-run movies are only $5. Kids get in for $4. Evening shows are $8. Sure beats the ArcLight!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adventurer6600
50,My favorite theater,"This is what moviegoing should be all about. Great mood with the incredible Egyptian interior from the '20s. Plenty of leg room. Excellent sound system. All all the latest flicks. I live in the area, and I skip all the multiplexes, if I have a chance to see a movie at the Vista.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/361dennis
50,Best Theater in Hollywood,"You want local feel without missing out on big name theater perks? Well go to the Vista off of silverlake. I didn't know places like this still existed and the fact that they stay profitable is beyond me. But they get all the big name films so you aren't missing anything the big boys are showing. BIG pluses for spacious seating, great vibe, big sound beautiful decorations and clean seats with cup holders. Minuses? I can't think of any. The only smallest minus might be salty dogs and corn and no parking structure, but you can always ask for no salt and there's plenty of meter parking. Great for kids and adults. Definitely making it a regular movie spot for myself. See you at the Vista!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveTravel2764
50,WOW! I mean WOW!,"This theatre is excellent overall. Great staff, great service, and GREAT seating. The thing is, this theatre took out pretty much every other row, giving you EXTREME amount of leg space. The theatre is BEAUTIFUL with great detail. It has an amazing Egyptian theme to it, and the picture and sound...unbeatable. I, myself give this place a 10. PERFECT!",
30,Traitors,"This historical theater, has cement in front of it's entrance, with various celebrities hand and footprints and signatures. It is located in the Silver Lake Area, now home to the legendary Vampira. Elvira Stole her entire persona, claimed it as her own creation and has made millions. Vampira (Maila Nurmi) has little money, for her persona was stolen. This theater, mere blocks from Vampira's home, has the hand and foot prints of Elvira in it's cement. A travesty to history. An insult toa legend.",
50,Great theater with great sound.,"This movie theater is definately one of the old Movie Palaces from days long past. Oddly the outside of the Vista gives the impression that it is small and modest. Walk through the doors into the theater itself though and you'll see just how modest the outside facade truelly is. The inside has a wonderful egyptian theme with giant pharroes supporting the roof above, along with red carpeting and about 6 feet between you and the room in front of you. Oh, and did I mention the hard wood floors?!The theater is also equiped with a top of the line sound system. I see all of the big name action movies there because I know I'll get the biggest bang (literally) for my buck.",
