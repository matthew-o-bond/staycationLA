50,great experience,"This is a great little theater putting on good quality shows. I saw a show (Sugar Plum Fairy) here on my last night in town, and it was one of the highlights of my visit to Downtown LA. The staff and actors were are very nice, and professional. The theater is a smaller space, in an old church, so all the seats are good. I was able to use the metro system when travelling there, although it also looked like there might be parking nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wonder167
50,Mamma Mia!!,"I bought tickets for Mama Mia without know anything about the East West Players. I thought the performance was going to be good but I was not expecting much. BOY, were we wrong!! The theater was small and old but nicely kept. The staff was friendly. The show was great! The East West Player's performance of Mamma Mia blew us away! Every member of the cast could dance and sing and act. We could not believe the voices on some of the performers. I highly recommend this show to anyone who likes musicals and I will be looking forward future shows by the East West Players.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frankrP6334BX

50,One Night Only Fresh Faces Golden Voices,"We attended the One Night Only event at the East West Players home theatre downtown and were delighted. The venue is just the perfect size, and the building itself has its own history. But more than that, this company gives a voice to actors that might not be cast in mainstream venues, and we found that to be both refreshing and a little sad that this happens to be true. This particular show showcased young Asian talent from the area, and the quality of the performances was truly over the top. We noticed in the program that season tickets were highly affordable and this year's line up of shows promises to be excellent. Give East West Players a look!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cindil0uredhat
50,Historical Theater in Little Tokyo,"I've been following the East West Players since the 80's so this tells you how long the company has been around and they go back even further. The performances in the old Union Church provides intimacy with the audience as every seat in this small theater, including the balcony, offers a good view. Glitzy props are not visible here, just the basics and a good story is all that's needed.They offer a some discounts and perks so be sure to do your homework. You will feel some of the inconveniences from a building built in 1923...narrow stairways and cozy bathrooms, but it's worth the price for entertainment in a National Register of Historical Places.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shimadog

50,Marvelous production of Three Year Swim Club,"I attended the production of Three Year Swim Club at the East West Players Theater in Los Angeles. It was delightful. It is 1 1/2 hours long. The acting is superb. The theater is very intimate. I really loved the message that comes so clearly through to the audience about ""Reaching for the Stars"" and never give up. It is based on a true story and the actual people portrayed did do wonderful things and achieved what they set their minds to accomplish. It is certainly a treat to see this production.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaliforniaViv
