50,Spectacular!,Stunning park with amazing views. Trails for all hiking abilities. If you're in good shape there are a variety of aggressive trails with incredible vistas. Facilities and parking are top notch and the park entrance is through a very nice neighborhood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisH59
40,Multiple paths,"I always recommend going with someone. (I've gone on my own a few times but have wondered what would happen if I tripped and dislocated a shoulder or knee - not smart!) Make sure you have water, a hat, sunscreen, fully charged cell phone, a stick and/or whistle. Don't forget to put rubber bands at your ankles where your pants end, to keep bugs, ticks, spiders out. There aren't too many shady spots on the main path. After a decent rain, you'll hear little brooks and streams gurgling. There are different trails you can choose based on skill and stamina. The easy trail is my favorite. In the spring time, the hillside is awash in those tall plants with tiny yellow flowers and you almost hear a continuous hum of bees. It's great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StandardExpectations
50,Best view of Los Angeles on a clear day,Wonderful hiking of every level. Park is pleasant and inviting. Plenty of parking. Bring a picnic and enjoy. Worth the effort to go out of your way.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SistersontheMove
40,Gateway to the Angeles Forest & Mt. Lukens,"Not everyone knows that Mount Lukens is the highest point in the Angeles National Forest, and even if you do, you might want to hike there from this lovely park. And you have two routes to choose from, one easterly and one westerly, each providing breathtaking views of the Crescenta Valley and beyond, plus a few surprises along the way (like the ""blue bug"" and the rock circle, aka The Redoubt, partway up the Crescenta View Trail.For the less ambitious, there are nice trails right within Deukmejian itself, that lead from a pleasant picnic area next to the Stone Barn to various spots above the bowl of Dunsmore Canyon. Try the Le Mesnager Loop with its ridge-top views, or the easy Mummy Rock Trail, or the Vineyard Trail; step carefully as snakes abound among the weeds and rocks. Just as likely you'll see cottontail or brush rabbits, quail, tree frogs, towhees, ground squirrels, California thrashers, deer, scrub jays and a variety of other species.The semi-hidden grass lawn a hundred feet or so above the parking area is great for picnicking or meditation, but the peace is sometimes disrupted by people exercising their off-leash dogs (a park no-no, and also a bad idea because of the snakes. But you can't tell the off-leash people anything! As long as I'm complaining: The mountain bikers have discovered the park and the lower trails are consequently showing the unmistakable signs of bike-tire erosion, so trail repair will be in the park's future sooner rather than later. Why do I complain, you ask? The gullies created by tire erosion not only slice off the trail edge eventually, they fill with dust and disguise themselves, making a trap for one's ankles -- I myself have been permanently injured by stepping into a tire-gully. It is what it is, though bike people often deny that this phenomenon happens.)The park offers frequent nature programs focusing on reptiles, geology and native plants -- these add much to the enjoyment of this gem of a park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoCalRambler
40,Beautiful view,"Wow, it is a quiet place but beautiful view. You don't get a clear shot of LA due to the hill blocking the view but still gorgeous. There is a small grassy area and picnic tables and restrooms.Trails start from here but didn't have a chance to hike any yet. Looking forward to heading back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlwaysExploring17
50,Love this place,"Lived in the area for three months and for two months Mon-Fri cycled almost the length of New York, then up the ramp to Deuk parking lot....then ran the Mes Loop. I'm no spring chicken (60) and there's a great selection of easy to extreme gradients to suit everyone. Never got bored with the run or the views. Stunning. Got to know Arthur each day for a chat and laugh who looks after the area. Great character.Have hiked to the summit of Mt Lukens (stunning view if clear skies) and many of the trails over the years. Absolutely love the area. Be careful of Rattlers in summer of course as they can be loitering on the trails... real wildlife adds to the fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/harleyBoy42
50,"Beautiful Views, and great hikes","Deukmejian Wilderness Park is a really nice place that we enjoy taking our dog (on leash)The lower grassy areas are very pleasant, and then the hikes up the hill quickly reach some beautiful vistas. We especially like the fairly short walk up to the shady oak tree.We are so happy that Joy, and artfromtheashes.org chose to help rehabilitate this area after the station fire.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobwish
50,A Nature Getaway!!,"When city life gets to me, I come here. The view alone can soothe your soul. It is a great place to hike, picnic, or just check out from the daily grind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karynb627
40,Nice park for a hike,"This park have several hiking trails, but one main is used generally. The hike is on the hillside above some soccer field and other sports complex. It is a handy neighborhood place to walk or hike, not a touristy spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveltrivia
50,"Hang out, take a short walk or a long hike","Nice little park but I used it as a starting point for a few serious hikes. The best one is to take the Crescenta View trail up to Mt. Lukens road, then go west to Lukens, then three more miles west and catch the Rim Of The Valley trail back to Deukmejian park. Total time 4.5 hours, total distance 9.5 miles. Mostly west facing slopes so morning is best on warm days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P8014LXbillb
50,Great views of the local environs and a very cool park.,I enjoy the views of the surrounding cities and you are above the hussel and bussel of it all. Good place to picnic and to chill.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1jjarecki
50,Great walking trails!,"I have been visiting this park for over 20 years and love being there. In the winter there is snow on the upper trails (a treat for us So Cal folks), and in the summer the trails offer great views and easy walking hikes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dieselthis
50,Nice park to hang out for an hour or two.,"Great view on a clear day. We take the dogs and have lunch on the well maintained benches. There is a nice patch of grass which is nice to lay a blanket down to stretch out for a nice nap. There are bathrooms available, and lovely flora to admire along the pathways. We enjoy hiking up the hill a bit and exploring the large trails which are also well maintained. I wish people would clean up after their dogs more, but it's not as bad as the dam.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaraM291

50,Hikes close to Glendale,This is a beautifully maintained park with many great hikes for all levels. Check out their monthly activity schedule.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emmadear
40,Moderate Climb Among Peaceful Surroundings,Several trails to choose. Most are moderate. Nice views but was quite cloudy today so no real vista views. Interesting flora. Did not see much fauna. Easy to access by car.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ptyduke
50,Hidden gem!,Love this park. We take our dogs to throw them Frisbees and walk the trails. Well kept park area and wilderness trails for long walks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CherylLuvNLife
40,"Nice views, decent facilities, good picnic spot","Popped in here for a quick lunch at a picnic table and a brief stroll - seemed delightful. Great views from the picnic area, a little windy that day but enjoyable. Seemed to be well provided with toilets, dog-poop-bags and so on (lot of dog walking going on here), and a range of paths through the hills to suit all tastes. Scenery combines wild and fire-scarred hills with the clutter and smog of the city below.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jinox
40,Good Hikes Here!,"I'm all about the hikes... well, mostly anyway.There is plenty of parking, restrooms and water below as well as open spaces for pick nicks and other traditional park activities. There are nice views even without hiking up too.The hikes are easy to moderate. I led a group of very young Girl Scouts on a hike here. Most had never hiked before. One parent turned back, but the girls did just fine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bentheredunthat
50,Beautiful views,This park has a 1.5 mile loop. The trail is fairly steep and challenging. There is a great viewing spot at the top. There is also a trail that hooks up with the Pacific Trail...several miles away. We did not take that trail. There is plenty of parking and restroom facilities. No fee.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brooklynn88
50,Good Views,"Very, very nice picnic area. This is also a good place to see fireworks on July 4th. Nice hiking area, good trails. You can bring your dog.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patqui
40,Wilderness near the city,"Take advantage of this fine, nearly hidden park in the foothills of Glendale. The restored stone barn (hoping they open it up sometime soon for events or tours), fronted by a small vineyard is a nice backdrop for a picnic, or to start a hike on the trails up into the hills. You really feel ""away from it all"" but right near everything. I've enjoyed it with family and friends, and especially like to sketch and do plein air painting there. Great view over the city too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlendaleJ
40,many excellent hiking trails,This is one of our favorite hiking wilderness park. There are 2 parking lots but you do have to get there early to snag a spot especially during the weekends. The rest-rooms are conveniently located right across the parking lot.Spring is the best time to hike here as you'll get to enjoy many varieties of wildflowers in bloom. Many locals walk their dogs here so they have doggie-pooper bag dispensers situated by the entrance to the park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3Kells
50,Great Hiking,"This is a great wilderness park in the north park of Glendale. One of the best things about this park is that it is FREE! Things I like, the various picnic areas, clean bathrooms, numerous hiking trails based on your skill and athletic ability. Lastly, the scenic views for picture taking are pretty amazing. Dislikes, the smokers and visitors that forget what trash cans are for. Overall, a great place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gr8puck
50,Beatiful Gem,"Lovely wilderness park on the outskirts of L.A. No one seems to know this park exists because there are so few people who go, but it is a gorgeous place. Wonderful hiking trails, a beautiful old stone barn, lovely picnic areas, and views, views, view. From some spots, you can see the ocean and the skyline of L.A. in the distance. Great place for a lovely hike, or a nice picnic with friends, and I've been several times, but never experienced any crowding.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peggyw305
20,Not much here,"This is not really a ""wilderness"" park. It is situated a half-a-mile or so from houses. The surrounding area of the park was severely burned by fire several years ago, so it is rather bare. Trails lead from the park and go up into the mountains. I suppose long hikes into the mountains would take one to more wilderness-type areas, however, short hikes will not get you very far and certainly not into a beautiful terrain area.There is some historical structures on the site, but they are not open to the public.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rogerdob
50,Once Tiburio Vasquez walked this park.,"The rumor when the park opened was that the bandit Tiburio Vasquez hid in the hills in the 1800's. I can imagine why, the view over the valley is great and it is a pleasant place to have a picnic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
