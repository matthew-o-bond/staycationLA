50,"If You Love Planes, this Little Place is for You.","This is a great little museum that your kids will love. If you have an aviation addict in the family they will be so happy if you take them there. Personally, I don't care much about planes, how fast they go or which one was made by Lockheed and which one by Douglas Aircraft. However, my grandson likes planes and what he wants he usually gets. I had a great time, despite my fear I would be bored to tears. I actually learned a lot there and my grandson got to sit in the cockpit of a small place and touch, well, everything. The fee is about 5$ and I did not pay to park. I am not sure if I was lucky or if parking is free.Now, I only know this because I was taught it the day we were there by some great volunteers: They have the YF-23 Black Widow and the YF-Cobra. I am told these are rare planes to see. They also have a large selection of historical items and some planes so small you have to wonder how the person that made it lived to tell the tale.The staff is super sweet. So, stop by and take the kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
50,Fun with kids,"This is a nice small museum good for the grandkids. My grandsons (8, 6, 4) enjoyed being able to get into the cockpits of some of the planes. We also watched planes land and take off from the observation deck.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gr8fish2017
50,Small but great museum,"It’s out of the way for many people but it has some special exhibits that make it worthwhile, including the YF-23 and some rare wind tunnel models from the days when this part of L.A. held many of the world’s wind tunnels. I was the only visitor for the day but there were half a dozen volunteers working on the exhibits and very keen to tell me everything they could. After the small main hall, you need to get one of them to drive you over to the collection of fighter jets at the other end of the airport. Only $5 entry - very worth it if you’re in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrdom
50,Interesting airborne history,An interesting peek at the advances in flight machines. Some old timey planes that make you wonder at the courage of these early pilots risking all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/130sandyp
40,"Outstanding group of docents for a wonderful, smaller museum","Visited the Western Museum of Flight and was pleasantly surprised at how much history and memorabilia was available in a relatively small area. Several unique aircraft are on display both in the hangars at the main location and in a fenced-in outdoor display area. The docents are all very knowledgeable and able to give the history or background on all of the displays.This is a MUST DO item for dads or grandfathers and the younger generation including the gals. Start them young, plant the seed, and feed their interest in aviation..!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wgriff1
40,Fun visit for airplane buffs,"Okay, so this museum is not large, but it was fun climbing around and even inside a fighter plane, and seeing all the videos and old newspaper articles about aviation history in the West. We talked with several volunteers while there - including some retired military pilots who knew the answers to our questions, and helped us find more info on specific planes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelersHigh77
50,A great little museum with a small but very special collection of unique aircraft (YF23 & YF18),"What a wonderful find...This small aviation museum located on Torrance airfield where the Robinson Helciopters are built is a must see for any aviation enthusiast.I was on a business trip to the west coast and managed to get my driver to take me back to LA from a meeting in Newport via this for an hour.I was well rewarded, both by the welcome from the volunteers, as well as by the quality of the exhibits.However, make sure that you ask to be shown the 'prototypes'.Away from the main hangar the museum has a collection of unique aircraft - most notably the YF23 prototype and the YF18 prototype as well as an early T-38 talon and an F-14.It was a wonderful opportunity to get close to aircraft that I had only seen in photos before and to discuss them with the knowledgable volunteers who keep this south west aviation history alive.in the main hangar I was encouraged to sit in the Norwegian F5 and look at the Bede-5 and F86 that they have as well as the Harrier stored in the open outside.Thank you to everyone. it was a memorable afternoon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IanStrat
40,Outstanding Little Museum with a Nice Hidden Surprise,"This is a great little museum with some nice pieces in it. A lot of models and planes in the main hanger. Across the way in the other hanger is a harrier. The harrier was very nice. You can take pictures of everything. The volunteers there are very friendly and helpful. At the end of my visit they told me to drive down to the end of the airport. There were more planes over there. An F-14, a YF-23 and a few more. If you like aviation then this is a good place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Briman747
50,Small but interesting museum.,The highlight of my visit to this museum was the conversations I enjoyed with some of the docents. They're as much a fascinating part of aviation history as the items on display.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdR98597
30,Fun Museum,"Staff by volunteers it is great to see that this museum has enough to offer. It's not a place I would always go to as there is a limited amount of display but when they have the WWII planes flying, that is a great time to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaniloDivesAgain2018
40,Hidden Gem in Torrance,"This is a great little museum for Torrance run by volunteers. There are a number of planes, displays, and videos. I even was able to sit in F5 fighter and was amazed at all the controls pilots had to deal with. Really enjoyed the video about the Torrance airport development over time. Location has free parking and you do not have to fight the Los Angeles traffic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lukeanthonywflorida
40,Great place to take the Grandsons,We really enjoy visiting This museum. They have an F5 fighter that my grandsons climb in and explore. Fun place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melodykulsic
30,"if you dont want to leave southbay, its fine","comparing to other LA attractions, it rates low, but for 'little"" southbay it is fine for a couple of hours",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/douglaswilliamm
40,Great little museum,"Watch for events at this museum, they have speaker & other fun events. Parking in lot .... Easy off frwy Crenshaw south ... & Lot of restaurants close by for a meal before or after.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YardSaleLdy
50,Great aviation history displays and people.,"As the other reviews mention, there are many interesting and a few unique items on display. Ever wonder where the spare engine for the Spruce Goose ended up?What I would like to add to the previous reviews is that the staff members are an importsnt part of aviation history as well! I had the pleasure of being guided through the displays by one of the docents, Jack.He shared some of his extensive hands on experience with the testing and development of many diverse aviation programs. He is a fascinating person to have the pleasure of speaking with. Although I didn't speak with other staff members at length, my guide spoke very highly of their experiences and expertise as well.If you are fortunate enough to visit this museum, you should absolutely make a point of speaking with the volunteers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edr45152
50,Local Gem,"After living in the South Bay Area for decades, I finally visited the museum which I learned moved to the current site 8 years ago from the Hawthorne airport. I have to say that if you have any interest in airplanes and the story of Louie Zamperini the museum is worth a visit. While small, it has very nice information on the planes displayed and a small library. The volunteers are all passionate about aerospace stuff and are very welcoming and friendly. Well worth a small donation for a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BoboTravlr
50,"Small in size, large in interest","It's a small museum. The hanger has a lot of interesting things to look at and there are always a few dozens around to help with questions and the entry fee is only $5. There is around a dozen planes, and every one is worth the trip. The star of the show is their Northrup YF-23 Advanced Tactical Fighter. It's one of the only 2 built and it's the one that flew against the Lockheed F-22 to find who was going to build our nations air superiority fighter plane. Lockheed won, even though the F-23 was faster and more stealthy, because the Lockheed plane was more maneuverable and a little cheaper to build. The planes here are not on pedestals or behind a tape. You can walk right up to them and touch them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Banerman
40,A gem tucked away in Torrance CA,"Very nice, small museum. The exhibits a small, but very interesting, especially the Lou Zamperini section (as a great tribute to our local hero). You can tour it in less than two hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KFrasier
50,A pilots delight,As a pilot when I drop into Torrance Airport this a place I always drop by this place. Great historical aviation. Also see the Zamperini museum while at the Airport.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/905iana
40,Nice little museum,"If wanting to visit an aviation museum near Los Angeles is in your plans, this is worth the trip. It's a small museum, but has a good collection. The aircraft we wanted to see (YF-17, YF-23) are located on the other side of the field behind a fence. Only thing I wish is that they move these planes closer to the actual museum hangars so we can get a better close-up of them. Staff was very friendly and willing to just chat for anyone interested.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Snowcats95
40,Small But Okay,"Very limited number of exhibits and it will not take more than an hour or two to visit and view everything. However, there are some interesting things to view and is definitely worth a visit for the aviation enthusiest",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shrike2747
30,Too Small and Cramped,"This is very small museum, I was hoping for more kind of cramped, needs more room for displays of aircraft. Nice staff what is there is interesting but you can look at everything in less than 1 hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FilAmfighter1
40,Wonderful visit and hospitality!,"We visited the museum today and really enjoyed their offerings. We initially had difficulty finding the place, and because it is on a real airport, you need to enter a code on the keypad for them to buzz you in. It is run by volunteers, and ask for a $5 donation per person, very worth it! They have mostly military planes, engines, and equipment, and even had a Norden bombsight that my father used in World War II! We saw a harrier jet trainer, and an exceptional volunteer, Neil White, escorted us to a section of the runway which contained a number of Navy jets which we got to see up close. I can't express enough thanks for his hospitality and knowledge about aircraft, and the history of aviation at Lamperini Field. They even have now defunct missile silos on site! This is truly a hidden gem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cheryal
40,Excellent Flight Museum,This is a comparatively small museum but it has some fascinating exhibits - notably the Northrop YF-23. It is very informative and has some unusual things not found elsewhere. Can spend a couple of hours enjoyably,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sunilvk64
40,Modest but with unusual content,"The Northrop/McDonnell Douglas, YF-23, Gray Ghost is enclosed in a fenced area at the end of the air field, away from the museum, but the staff will run you down there and provide access upon request.The museum collection is rich but the displays are informal. It was just a pleasant garage tour. Check out the library too! I picked up a very special used radar text.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhotoCouple
50,Torrance Rocks!,"So if you think Torrance is boring and has nothing to see, WRONG! This little museum located by the Torrance Airport is somthing to see. Lots of wonderful pictures, instruments and planes! Plus, Torrance Airport is a wonderful place to watch the ""birds fly""!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/228nb
50,Small gem,Very informative and lots of information of aerospace in the South Bay. Lots of unusual thing that you won't see anywhere else,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovesfamilymmmmmmmm
40,Very informative place,Been there twice. It's small but the people are great and have bought 2 t shirts there. Great information to learn there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fredo186
30,Great history in a small package,"The museum although small packs a lot history and interesting artifacts, the volunteers and employees are really attentive and welcoming even to the little ones. A great way to spend a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X3006PJmichaelb
50,Great museum at Torrance Airport,The actual museum is small in size but it packs in a LOT of great aviation history in the space. About an hour or two should get you through the exhibits. Usually have very knowledgeable docents at the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingFromHermosa
40,An amazing but little known attraction.,"This is a great stop for anyone, especially families and kids. My husband has a small plane at Torrance Airport, and one day we stopped at this small but interesting museum on the site. I was surprised at what was there. Memorabilia, history, and of course, planes. If anyone is in the area and has a few minutes and needs to see something different, this would be a great 30-60 minute stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoAnnS582
50,Excellent Small Museum in LA,"A small museum about 12 miles south of LAX. Good small collection with very friendly people, easy access and easy to find. Key exhibits are the YF-17 Cobra and YF-23A however these are stored in a separate area near the display hangars. You will need to get to the museum a little before closing to see these and ask to be shown / guided to them. It is worth it for these two birds alone. Additionally there is a well preserved Harrier 2 seater on the grounds. Cheap entry (USD 5) and only takes 1 to 2 hours max.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MushnKit
40,History,"They have F-14 Tomcat (which appear in Topgun) and numerous other Northrop places, some of them are wind tunnel models. Anyone who have interest in our plane history will learn a lot from visiting this museum. I must also mention the knowledge of the man that took us through our visit, he knows the planes....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WWglobal
40,GUEST LECTURE,We went to the Western Museum of Flight for a guest lecture given by a bomber pilot that was stationed in India during WWII. The lecture was outstanding.The museum has a lot more aircraft than I thought it had and some really good static displays. If you are interested in aviation this is really deserving of a visit.They have a lot of programs geared for kids both 5-10 and 10-18 years old.We will be comming back as they line up more guest speakers.Great place to spend a couple of hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/707clayg
50,"Nice Museum, Awesome Staff","I've been to the Western Museum of Flight (WMOF.COM) twice; once with my family and once as our cub scout den leader and both times were great. While its a small and compact museum, it has a lot of really nice planes, models, and aviation equipment to see and some to sit in. It has a modest gift shop. The collection is mostly Northrop-Grumman but has a sprinkling of other manufacturers. It ranges from a model of Leonardo DaVinci's model of flight to biplanes, jet planes, and space memorabilia.It has its own parking and entrance next to the Torrance Airport. You park, and walk down stairs to get to the museum. I don't recall a way for mobility challenged folks to get in.The staff is knowledgeable and tell great stories. They give a small grounp personal tours. For our Cub Scout den they even stayed open after 3pm on Tuesday to allow my second graders to see the museum. The scouts were thrilled. They really enjoyed it. It took perhaps 90 minutes but was well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/461alh
40,Small but interesting,"The museum is not so big, but they have some gems which are worth seeing. The star must be the YF-23! The museum is housed in a small hanger near the other GA aircraft and costs a voluntary donation of $5 per person. There is an F-5A which you can sit inside. To get to the YF-23 you need the good-will of one of the museum volunteers to take you along the ramp, as the aircraft is based outside the hanger with an F-14 and one of the F-18 prototypes. We were fortunate to be taken by Jim, who is a veteran flight test engineer of the Douglas aircraft company, and is extremely knowledgable. Thanks Jim for a great visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SimonP523
40,A hidden gem,"This Museum is small but interesting. They host excellent guest speakers (check the website) its a great stop if you are looking for something to do with the kids, but young at heart will find memories to relive when walking through the museum",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DACAZA
30,More of A Collection Than A Museum,"The Western Museum of Flight is good, but it is not really a museum as we might expect. It is more of a collection. It is housed in a hanger, which is great, but the displays are very crowded into a small space. There are a few aircraft that you examine close up. This alone makes a visit worthwhile. Included are an F86 and an F5. Where else can you touch one of those?There are a large number of models. Of particular interest are the test models used in wind tunnels. Signs explain the many items on the displays. But, what the museum really needs a methodology to put these things more in context.Admission is very inexpensive, it is only suggested $5. It is a small price. The museum is, as I mentioned, in a hanger on an active flight light. You will have to be buzzed in through the gate. But this is the ""real deal"" and I am sure you will enjoy it. Just be aware that if you are looking for a big-time museum such as the one in Seattle or the one in Washington, DC this is not there, yet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rogerl53
20,Nobody opened the door,"It was very disappointing. I drove down from Sherman Oaks with my son who wanted to see the museum on a Sunday afternoon during the posted hours. It is located within a secured area of the local Torrance Airport and one has to be buzzed in through a gate. We rang and rang and indeed you could hear the phone ringing through an open door just a hundred feet away, but nobody came. We ended up continuing on with a hastily improvised ""Plan B"", continuing on elsewhere further south. Signage at the entrance was poor and we wondered if we indeed were even where we were supposed to be, but there appeared to be no other entrances. From the outside it also appears a very small museum...fine for younger ones, but older ones will go through it quickly by the looks of things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tp21-5649
50,Definitely worth visiting,Still a work in process but a great place to visit. It is nice to see the way aviation has progressed. Staff were readily available to answer any queries that you may have.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MauriceC841
30,Interesting,"The Western Museum of Flight at Torrance (CA) airport, is small but interesting. Admission is in the form of a $5.00 donation. I've posted a few pictures which pretty much tells the story. It's worth spending 60 - 90 minutes looking around if you are in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertL873
50,Hands on museum,"This is a small museum that has the Northrop JB-1 flying wing.The museum is not busy. So you can walk arround freely. I could look at the airplanes from all sides, Left, right, front, back and under. Appart from the flying aitframes you can touch, snif and look at everything in detail. The staff is very fiendly and helpful. They do not have much space so they can only display a small portion of the collection. An extention is planned and I will definately go back when they have more on display. They also have an extensive library on just about anything with wings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnny-belgium
