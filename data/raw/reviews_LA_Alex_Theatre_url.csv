50,We really enjoyed The Greatest Cartoons Ever program,"The moderators were interesting, funny and had tremendous insight into the creators of the cartoons. It is a great event for adults and kids!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Realestateforyou
50,Nutcracker Ballet,"We attended the Los Angeles Ballet performance of the Nutcracker and it was a perfect holiday event. The theater itself is easy to get to, with parking at the Glendale mall across the street. It is in a lovely art deco style building. The inside space is fairly large but sight lines are good and we were able to see everything quite well from the 20th row. The ballet itself was also quite good and the costumes were amazing. If all of their productions are like this there will be many more ballets in our future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lindarene
40,Yanni performance was wonderful.,We went to see the Yanni performance and it was great. He did some talking with the audience and it was very intimate. The theatre is pretty and has drinks and comfortable seating. Not too big and great atmosphere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MamaMia796
40,Magic Show,"Aside from the show being awesome, this theater was great. Smaller theater, but not tiny. Easy to see and hear from the balcony seating. Since this was a magic show with the magician interacting with the audience at certain points in the show, it would have been better to sit on the main level. We could not see the audience members sitting beneath the balcony that were interacting with the magician..... but the theater itself was fine. The bathrooms were clean, the food and beverages were offered outside the theater and you were able to bring them with you to your seat. Very nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keldubois
50,Gay Men's Choir,Have gone numerous times to the Alex Theatre in Glendale to see the LA Gay Men's Choir. Always delightful performance. Would recommend it highly to anyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacquelene2016
50,This is whats a movie theater was and a hollywood icon,"This is a shrine to the wonderful atmosphere people used to watch movies. I first went in 1954....San the Magnificent 7 here as a kid.... The architecture is stunning... The interior memorable.Sadly it is no closed... only being used for occasional functions of questionable value and quality. So sad This is a place where you should experience a movie... Not see some third rate act....it was ment for movies, not live stahe...... You can no longer stroll the Grecian garden path up to the front door as it has iron gates to keep the bums out.... It still is an icon like the Greek, Pantages and the other classic theaters of Hollywood. ..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hawaiidan
50,Quintessential Glendale,"I've had the chance to attend movies, ballets, and an open house at the Alex Theatre. It's always a friendly, warm experience.

40,This is an old movie house and still looks like art deco.,"It is a part of historic Glendale, and sits on Brand Blvd., near many restaurants and shopping. It reminds me of the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood, except that I can walk to the Alex.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S25CVannes

50,Beautiful Theatre,"I have attended a number of shows at the Alex Theatre and I really love the beautiful architecture. The interior has been renovated and the sight lines are pretty good. The theatre staff are friendly and helpful and parking is plentiful in the area. Plus, there are a great variety of restaurants within walking distance to enjoy a meal either before or after a show. Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SgtBuffy
50,Very cool and important piece of Americana,"Think about it. Over 90 years ago movies were not on 100 screens per city. In 1925 silent movies filled the screen. The first The Wizard of Oz was screening and most of us didn't even know there was one before the famous remake. This place has been immaculately preserved although the movies are replaced by live performances, you can imagine the grand-ness of watching a first screening in this luxurious setting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kauai-Biz-Traveler
50,To see Marilyn the musical,The Alex theatre is old but well taken care of. It has an interior/ exterior courtyard. There was a red carpet and many people taking and drinking while waiting for play yo begin.Has upstairs and downstairs. Great place to see a play!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/riyet
50,Amazing history of Hollywood,"The Art Deco architecture alone is worth a visit, but take time to read about the history of this once movie theater. It played a role in screening many of Hollywood classic movies and many a movie's ending was changed based on the audience reactions here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/McWett
50,Great theatre,First time here - beautiful Art Deco building with comfortable seating! Views were good and acoustics better - worth a visit for any kind of show - visit Portos across the street !!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/840clivec
30,The theatre was OK but then....,"We attended a two day seminar for lack of a better description. As such we were in the facility for about 6 hours of a 9 hour day. The second day the A/C either did not keep up or quite entirely. The temperature wasn't the issue but the airflow was stagnant and I have no idea if its related but I ended up the first respiratory type cold I've had in at least 5 years.The decor, sound and seat comfort were good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Heligypsy
50,Fine theater for live performances,My wife and I attended a ballet at the Alex recently. We bought tickets in the second row on the left and had a fine view of the dancers and sets. The sound and acoustics were excellent. Access and egress were easy even though the event was a sell out. The seats were comfortable. The location is good. We found on-street parking about a block away and paid $3.25.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lorne29
50,"Cool historic theater, great place to see a show",Saw a Mindy Kaling Live Talks LA book talk here and absolutely adored the venue.

50,Majestic Alex,"I love excuses to go to this historic beautiful theater which is about to celebrate its 90th year! It's been restored, don't worry. I've seen Michael Lewis and Malcolm Gladwell. Billy Elliot. Last Comic Standing was also filmed here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luswei
50,A cultural showcase in Glendale,"The Alex Theatre has just completed a multi-million dollar restoration and offers something artistic for everyone. From classic movies to ethnic dance groups to stand up comedians, the Alex is the place to build your fun times around. The acoustics are great and the seating is comfortable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/David_DeMulle
30,"Beautiful theatre, but better sound in my car","The entire house has pretty good seating / viewing of the stage, but that is expected at a small to medium sized venue. What was disappointing was the sound. I went there with a friend to see Swan Lake, and being fond of Tchaikovsky, I was thrilled to go, even if we were in the nosebleeds. However, throughout the performance, I just wish they had passed out headphones. Perhaps my standards are too high from recently going to the Pasadena symphony . . .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Antrim8
50,A real restored historical theater in Glendale,"It is absolutely beautiful. It has a coffee bar outside that serves beer and""Porto's Confections"" that starts your journey into what a real theater used to be like. Cannot say enough about the restoration. Everything is great. They have film festivals, plays and musicals, and every seat is a great seat. If you like historic theaters, this is a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/David_DeMulle

Seats were comfortable, there really wasn't a bad seat for viewing the production. We thoroughly enjoyed the CS Leis play ""The Great Divorce""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Christine92057
50,Wonderful Theater,This is a classic theater that was converted from a movie house that had been closed for years into a major concert and professional live theater. I worked there as an usher captain for over 5 years. Great venue that did all kinds of shows. Beautifully remodeled when it was reopened about 30 years ago. Several major groups use this as their home theater. It is a landmark for the Glendale and surrounding areas.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krosmon
30,"dated, needs upgrading","4.20.2013 - saw the LA Chamber Orchestra performing Handel & Mozart concertos. Jeffrey Kahane conducted and performed on the piano. We had balcony seats. The sound quality was decent. The seatings, fussy 1920s decor and garish lighting really needs modern upgrades. Their last redevelopment was in 1992.I noticed most of their patrons are older. Old people die eventually. You need young people to support and rivitalise the Arts.Their website says it is now closed for renovations from 7/1-10/31.Bravo! We're certainly looking forward to see the improvements.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3Kells

40,Charming theatre,"The theatre offers a diverse selections of shows. I have enjoyed seeing the LA ballet perform there, and dance recitals. The ambiance is lovely in the heart of Glendale. Tickets are not very expensive and parking one block away. It is a nice venue that I like to visit whenever I find a dance recital showing there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliissa
40,Interesting behind the scenes tour,Our dance group had a tour of the Alex which included a history of the theater and visits to areas behind and under the auditorium. The tour leader was very good at describing the efforts to save and renovate this important Glendale landmark.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrancisS496
40,Beautiful venue,"We went to the Alex Theatre to see my nephew perform in the orcehstra for the David Arkenstone's Symphonic Adventure on March 16th. I loved the feel of the theatre. It was nice, clean and beautifully decorated. It is a small venue, but we didn't feel cramped. We had seats about 15 rows up from the stage, and could see the everything wonderfully. The employees were very helpful with seating, and making sure that we all had our parking validations when leaving. There is a small stand out front with a few drink options - water, soda, beer and wine; and some treats, and not overly priced! I will definitely keep an eye on their upcoming performances to go to the theatre again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladywolfd

50,Gorgeous Old-School Venue,"Really fun architecture, sort of Roman-Greek, somethingerother. Lots of gold.

And fun, fun, atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peggyw305
