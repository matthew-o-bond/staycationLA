30,Nice little park but beware,"Stopped here for a break from walking all day. Pretty park. Very clean. Pretty much nothing is allowed (see pic). Looks like a nice place for kids. The only problem I had was I was sitting on a bench reading my book relaxing and was told that I had to sit properly. (No feet on bench, I had on foot on the bench). Huh?? What kind of rule is that? I can understand laying on the branch with all the homeless around but actually sitting with one foot on the bench? That’s a bit ridiculous.Are the kids allowed to play in the grass or will that kill it? Are people allowed to eat here? Drink coffee? Ugh with so many rules it’s not a pleasant place to visit and relax.Sorry but won’t be visiting this park ever again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Airstreaming1976
50,Great Park,"Clean, good mix of lawn, benches, small playground and because it is outside of FIDM, security walks during the open hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sisaroo127
50,Great pace to take a break,"Grand Hope Park is located adjacent to FIDM is a nice oasis in the South Park area. Grab lunch to go and hang out in the park. It's very clean, closed at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mauismead
40,Nice city park,In town for a convention and wanted a little break from the city. This park was small but peaceful. It is right outside an art institute. Beautiful mosaics and interesting fountains. It was a nice way to get a little bit of a nature fix in the middle of the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ticoalra
40,Nice addition to a morning jog,"This quant little park was a half mile from my downtown hotel and I had a nice morning jog to it and back to the hotel. Nice structural features (click tower, fountain, flower-filled arbor, etc.) and what looked to be a nice playground for kids. Also some basic exercise equipment (though none of it had much resistance).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RedTent1701
40,Small park,This is a small park downtown. It is a good place to stop and rest. There wasn't much else going on.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/715autumnm
40,Quiet Little Oasis Of a Park,"This little park at the corner Hope and 9th streets is a quiet and clean little park. On the day I was here, the park was populated by happy families and even a few folks sitting quietly meditating! Nice fountain and bronze coyote sculptures. What a happy rest stop on a big walking tour of downtown LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/968kippm
40,Passing time,"My wife and I had just dropped off our son at an acting class, and we drove downtown to walk around. My goal was to walk around the Staples Center and explore the area and we found this little gem along the way back to our vehicle. It is located in the Fashion District according to the map on my phone at the time, but I'm always up for exploring new places. There is a small location for kids to play, and there is a station for stretching if you are exercising, the grass was green, and the location look very clean. It was before noon on a Sunday so foot traffic was a little light, so I'm not sure how it is in the afternoon. I believe we spent a hour or so there peacefully walking around enjoying our alone time, so if you are in the area I would suggest to stop by to stretch your legs and explore around you. Thank you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Danimal3474
50,Equivalent of NYC central park without frills,"This is a very nice park, worth a stroll, great place for kids with an enclosed music park at the city hall end. It's a central place to locate if you want to walk (a lot) to explore cultural and other city features in all directions: Chinatown, theaters, museums, restaurants, other parks, business district, government district, etc. Nighttime park is lit up and picturesque.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kauai-Biz-Traveler
40,Cosy and great for kids,"Very nice small park next to the Fashion School. We went there for the small playground area they have - some other kids with moms were there and it was very nice. Well kept, with many trees to give shade and nice flowers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulkaR
40,City Park w Fountain ...,Visiting Grand Hope Park is something you do if you're in the area - it's Not a destination attraction. But it certainly is a welcome spot of greenery within the downtown concrete jungle & buildings. Has a nice fountain with water (at least for now) and places to sit. Rest a bit and enjoy the peacefulness. ...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
50,Great park!,I lived in a condo building for 2 weeks directly across the road from this park. It is in a great neighborhood with lots of stores and restaurants. I would walk around this park several times a day just to get fresh air. Several times we actually saw commercials being filmed and galas happening at this park..Its sort of a happening place!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Byrondwyer
50,A small Oasis,"This is a great little park in downtown Los Angeles bordered by grand and hope. We discovered it while searching for an apartment building we might be interested, If you are in the neighborhood and need a a place to sit down and enjoy a cup of coffee away from the city for a few minutes this is for you. It has water features, a kids playground and workout equipment. It feels safe and for whatever reason, the homeless have not taken it over. This is not an LA destination, but rather a wonderful amenity of a fast growing neighborhood of new and rehabbed apartments, condominiums and lofts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/332ThomasS
40,Even big kids will love the fountain!,"I've brought my kids here several times just to ooh and ahh at the color changing fountain. I think this experience is best at dusk so the kids really appreciate the color glow before them. Water embraces the floor in front of the fountain for a good 50 feet or so and kids love playing and splashing in it. There is a Starbucks conveniently located here too for the big kids. The park has a nice view of City Hall and the landscape is sort of desert like but peaceful. There isn't a whole lot here but kids will appreciate the effort just to partake in the fun of the fountain. Best part, it's free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
50,A Beautiful Relaxing Place with Great Design of Fountain,"It is a nice relaxing park located in Downtown LA. Just a couple of blocks away from Staples Center. We didn't plan for the visit. It was a coincidence discover this park when we visit FIDM-LA Campus. i would said it was a surprise of my trip. Actually we went there twice, one in day, one at night. In the day, you would enjoy the sunshine in the park and have a good breathing within those lush trees and lawn. Also the fountain is another attraction in the park. Especially at night, you will see the color changing underneath the water. You will feel the relaxing and calm while you stay in the park anytime. I Love this place a lot.!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJnish
50,"Beautiful, relaxing, and free!","This is a recent addition to downtown LA, and it is long overdue. In a city notorious for charging for everything (pay toilets?!), this place is an oasis. There are many roaring fountains sloped down a park that stretches from Grand to Main St. There are plenty of chairs, and security keeps the area safe. The trees and grass are well kept, and occasionally there is a music show down here. It's a great place to run through, or just take your coffee and read a paper.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrahamM676
