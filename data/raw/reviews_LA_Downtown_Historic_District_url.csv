40,Enjoyed Our Tour,We spent a whole day wandering this part of downtown reading all the history marks. Lots of classic architecture from the early 20th Century. More should be preserved.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TV2451
50,So many attractions plus great eateries,"We were staying practically in Downtown so had many opportunities to see a multitude of sights and partake in fine dining.Broadway is a great street to stroll along, bustling with activity and lined with an array of marvellous theatres dating from the golden age of performance and movies. Many if not all are still in use, albeit re-purposed for the 21st century.Spring Street has the LA Times Building, no longer home to the famous publication but still elegant. Further south is the incomparable Last Bookstore with a vast collection of books and music, vinyl and CD, and sofas for relaxing.A gorgeous building is Bradbury, restored to its former exquisiteness. It was marvellous entering the foyer and gazing at the tremendous ironwork, elevators and ceiling.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
50,Amazing Architecture,"I was our family tour guide during our morning stroll around Downtown, pointing out the various film, TV and amazing architecture, just love the place so different in styles and vantage points, well worth a good couple of hours just wandering.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeamWard
40,Great Architecture,"Great classic skyscraper architecture from the early 20th Century, probably best seen on a guided walking tour. Lots of hidden gems.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TV2451
20,Difficult to understand what we visited,"We walked around the historic district and further into what is classified as 'Downtown Los Angeles', but without a guide and with no signs or information anywhere we really only saw a lot of big buildings. We also didn't see anyone else looking like tourists, only a few people hurrying along in business clothes. The guided sight-seeing tour we took in Los Angeles, skipped this part completely!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HannaBragberg
40,Lots of Interesting Architecture,"The downtown is loaded with splendid examples of old fashioned sky scrapers plus some notable new arrivals. A lot of the old buildings have been converted to apartments bringing life to the area, so you will find restaurants and cafes. Plus some great museums and theaters. Only problem is the wide streets that promote lots of noisy traffic. Not pedestrian friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TV2451
40,Lots of Important Buildings,"Downtown is loaded with historic notable buildings from an earlier era. Many are being recycled as apartments and rediscovered. Downtown is interesting, but still dominated by the car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TV2451
10,Review of Downtown Historic Loft #2 Los Angeles,"We booked this place because of its location and in-house laundry amenities. Nearer the date we were given detailed instructions on checking in and were informed we were guests of Adagio Corporate Housing.The website we booked from did not have any link for reviews. It was clearly stated there was free parking. We later realised that this was not the case. The room was spacious and nicely furnished. The TV remote was missing ( ironical as the detailed instructions said to keep the remotes by tv or bedside before we vacate). There was a number given to contact if we needed help. We have stayed at service apartments in the UK, Australia and New Zealand and have never needed to bother the management. The manager texted a reply to download a “roku” app that lets me use my mobile as a remote; and said that the last tenant must have misplaced it. She said she would contact the owner about it but never bothered to reply. We used the app which did not work well. It was hard to turn the tv on and hard to turn it off. A few days later I called her and she ( Crystal) said the owner had not replied and had the gall to blame housekeeping and then insinuated that we should not be only watching tv on a holiday, which was uncalled for and untrue anyway. ( we had been out from 9am to 7pm and wanted to have dinner and watch tv). There was a cold draft from two windows. We signed on clearly for 4 guests but only 2 mugs were provided. The kitchen amenities were in working order.Overall, we felt the location was good but the inresponsiveness of the manager annoying. We do not expect red carpet champagne glass treatment but to have to battle with the roku app every time to watch some tv is too much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/InezP91
40,Lots to See,Great classic skyscraper architecture on view here. We loved this area full of great restaurants and bars and some Hollywood history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TV2451
30,Skyscrapers & Homeless,"Every city's downtown usually offers the best of what that city has to offer. Surprisingly it's not the case in Los Angeles. OK there are several admirable skyscrapers and of course plenty of restaurants, shops and cafes but on the other hand you can easily notice the poverty and dirtiness everywhere. Homeless are in huge numbers. I even felt unsafe in some neighborhoods. I was glad I just toured downtown LA for one day only and didn't make it my place of residence during my trip last July. I believe that this downtown serves only to be the civic center of LA (City hall, Courts, Prison etc...).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OsmanB511
40,Pretty cool,The LA downtown is busy and noisy. The office and bank towers marked the city center. A walk around this area gave us a short overview.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steelriver2014
50,Classic Skyscrapers,"Lots of classic skyscraper design here, especially buildings from the early 20th Century. Many are being repositioned as apartments, inspiring new entertainment and dining districts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TV2451
40,Cool architecture and everything in walking distance,"Vibrant is the word that comes to mind about downtown. It’s bustling with energy and you can find anything you want or need all around. There is a business center, cafes, restaurants, Food kiosks, coffee shops. Stayed here for work and it was a great location. I felt safe walking around and everything was easy to get to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SouthernBelles98
50,Its Historic and Modern,"In my opinion, that best Downtown anywhere. A mixture of modern skyscrapers and historic structures. Start exploring around the Music Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drdroad
50,A Real Downtown!,"Lots of great architecture, and sometimes you have to look carefully. Lots of food and coffee. And at times one feels in a real downtown. Lots of people live here now. Happy that it is being rediscovered.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TV2451
40,Relaxing walk around- lots of interesting things,"We just took a list of historic old buildings and walked around. Great mixture of old, restored and new. Interesting and relaxed walk. Make sure to extend walk to city hall area (lots of interesting things, small parks).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nedelakttraveler
40,Take a LA Conservancy guided walking tour,"Downtown Los Angeles contains many unique and hidden historic and architectural gems. Your best way to experience them is through a guided walking tour offered by the LA Conservancy. Our tour took us inside many of the beautiful and historic buildings including PacMutual, Bradbury, Central Library and Old Gas Company. Downtown LA is on a comeback and it's definitely worth staying and exploring this area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T4232XIjohnb
40,Art Deco Bonanza,"There are so many Art Deco buildings throughout downtown LA's historic district and surrounding downtown area that it took me the better part of a day to see all of them on a recent self-guided walking tour. (Visiting notable Art Deco buildings along Wiltshire from MacArthur Park towards La Brea took the rest of the day.) There are too many to list here but the highlight for me is the Eastern Columbia Building. They truly don't make them like that anymore. It's been turned into condominium lofts and there is no interior access (nor anything original to see inside, reportedly).The lobbies of some Art Deco building have been preserved just as well as the exteriors. Unfortunately, like the Eastern Columbia Building there is no public access inside some of them and when there is, security sometimes doesn’t allow photos. Notable exceptions include buildings that are intended to be publicly accessible, such as City Hall, the LA Central Library, Union Station and the LA Times building, the latter a private building but offering public tours. (All of those I just named are actually outside the “core” of the historic district but are historic nonetheless.)Sure, there are some not-so-pleasant aspects to walking the historic district including homeless and mentally unstable people on the streets, although personally I have never smelled urine there (and I’ve walked through the district quite a few times now). But few big cities in North America can boast that they are free of such problems.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MerelyATourist
40,Skyscraper and Theater Architecture,"Come and enjoy the skyscrapers and the theaters. Lots of examples of historic buildings, most of which are being preserved. Unfortunately the area is not pedestrian-friendly with way too much traffic moving quickly toward freeway on-ramps.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TV2451
40,"It's LA, it's historic!","Locals may not 'get' just how iconic this area is. Growing up and watching all those TV shows, this area was featured all the time and for those of us who never experienced it, it is pretty cool to see it now (despite the fact it has lost a lot of its lustre). Dicey at night, but in the day it's a neat walk, interesting shopping and eating venues, also home to the location where they filmed an awesome Toto video back in the 80s. The architecture still sets this apart from many other downtown cores.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ydnar
20,Down sums it up,"Wandering around from the business district you hit the down part. Nice historic buildings with some great facades. Although you want to wander looking at them the overall feeling is grimy, smelly and unsafe. Lots of LAPD about they need to be so many homeless wandering the streets. LA has such contrasts of have and have not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123LS
30,Enjoy classic and modern buildings and contrasts,"If you are an architecture buff don't miss seeing how vintage classic buildings give way to modern ones offering a place of dramatic contracts. On one side, luxurious shops and restaurants clash against the crawling poverty of hundreds of people leaving in camping tents across the sidewalks. Downtown is huge so I would suggest to drive around if you want to enjoy the full extend of it. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of massive metropolis but I guess it would be a nice place to go around if you are in shopping and architecture",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Curious401054
40,Downtown L.A.,"This district of Los Angeles will turn out to be very chaotic during daylight hours for the presence of numerous administrative buildings, sales and headquarters of major banks like any self-respected downtown. So you can enjoy the area's high-rise buildings, which appear to be less dense than in other US cities and rise toward the always blue sky. As for the evening, however, for us downtown meant only one thing: Staples Center! We stayed for a round of the NBA regular season and after we finished the evening nearby. It was not very populated after dark, except for the crowd coming out from the Staples Center. I believe that this area reaches its peak during daylight hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelcooking
40,"A lot to see around, need a full day!","If you are looking for great restaurants, evening roaming around then this is the place. This place had attractions for throughout the day, right from 9am later midnight. Must see places are Microsoft theater zone, staples etc., after 9pm this location is just colorful and great to stay around till midnight during weekends",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srinipamzn
50,Lots to See,"We just wandered and were pleased wth the classic downtown architecture. Some buildings have been renovated and more renovations are on the way. Unfortunately way too much traffic, noise and pollution.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TV2451
30,Mixed feelings,"Downtown LA is not a very noce area in the city. I went with my mom and she was kinda afraid of all the homeless. The streets smell pretty bad, is a very dirty and unsafe place. We stayed in a hotel in downtown that was actually a great deal for what we got. I love LA but downtown is not what I expected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ximehouses
30,Yet little remains until this becomes worth visiting,"Certainly there are parts of the city center is interesting but it is overshadowed by all social misery. Most are within walking distance.Combined the visit with Art District, The Broad and some occasional restaurant, it immediately becomes much more interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phayao13
10,Nope,"This area would have been really neat.....back in 1950 or so. Now it is dirty Dirty DIRTY with a post-apocalyptic level of mentally ill people, homeless people, and mentally ill homeless people.I've been to old cities that are dirty; Paris/London/Florence but LA is not ""old"" so there's really no excuse for the filth.It wasn't unsafe per se; plenty of LAPD around.There are some neat architectural buildings in the 400-500 Blk of Broadway. In most cases the neat building are now gross stores selling.....well I don't know. Lots of baseball hats and quincenerra dresses for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/583JohnH583
10,Concrete Asylum,"Downtown LA is crazy. Crazy that there can be so much wealth and poverty living side by side. The sidewalks reek of urine, and are full of obviously mentally ill homeless people. Sure there are some really interesting and historic buildings to see, but it's hard to get past all the bad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1mohman
50,The historic Architecture,"I came here on July 5th, with the Glitterati Tour to see Downtown. I went into the Downtown Historic District where I went inside the Bradburry Building of 1893. Some of the buildings in this district were completed from the 1800s to 1960s. It had movie theaters, shops, and restaurants. It is on the preservation and is targeted for restoration.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buddhakouri
20,One of the ugliest downtowns,"I walked around downtown LA and I felt very dissapointed.I was expecting a better kept city.It's full of homeless people.With the exception of a few streets, the rest is too ugly.Heard that there are plans to revitalize the whole area.I hope they do it.There are a lot of beautiful buildings but most of them look abandoned.I must clarify that I'm mostly referring to the area that comprises the theater district, the fashion district, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/golflover26
50,Urban LA,"This is not the image most of us have of LA. Old landmark buildings that remind me of buildings back east in New York, Philadelphia and Boston. Walking is the only way to enjoy this area. We were told to avoid skid row just east of the Jewelry district. I from New York do some of the urban grittiness in spots did not bother may as much as it might bother others, but it's not threatening. We walked during the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/875jl
30,Dead on the weekend,We stayed downtown because we went to a clippers game. There wasn't much action. Some very pretty buildings. Tons of dog crap everywhere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/715autumnm
40,Vey similar to downtown miami,"Downtown Historic distric is very similar to downtown miami, mostly office building other than the staple center and grammy's museum. it is still very nice to go see if you happen to be there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariovU1536HV
10,Scary,"I visited downtown LA having already done Hollywood, Beverley Hills, Culver City and Santa Monica. They all had mostly good things - the 2 hours we spent in LA were jaw dropping. I am from London and am used to seeing rich and poor living side by side, streets that need cleaning, homeless people in doorways. But LA is shocking. I lost count of the homeless and mentally ill shambling around or shouting out loud. Whole streets had tents and shopping trolleys full of possessions taking up the sidewalks. The shops are dire, the streets are filthy, the wonderful architecture of the historic bit has faded shamefully, and it's not remotely designed to encourage tourism. It was like some zombie apocalypse film set. I took my watch off as didn't feel safe, and I am 6'2 and over 300lbs. We got out of there ASAP to see the very pleasant natural history museum.See it so you can validate for yourself - but don't stay long!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Horsham0710
40,Architectural delight,"If you visit the historic core of downtown LA, I'd suggest trying to see it both during the day as well as at night because it's two different experiences. During the day, there are so many wonderful buildings to see with very ornate architectural detail. At night, there is a lot of neon from old theaters that can't be missed. This place is also coming alive again as many of the buildings are being restored and renovated. Lots of little eateries and dessert shops are popping up. My two favorite places down here are Clifton's and Bottega Louie. If you have the time, give them a try.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
50,What a surprise,"It's my second time in L.A. and this time i decided to visit this part. What a surprise. Downtown is full of interesting places, from the Town Hall to the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Great buildings and great parks. A nice surprise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paolovbossi
40,Sort of reminds me of Dallas with the high..,"glass and old architecture buildings and the homeless asking for money! But I believe that if you want to travel, you have to conquer your fears and allow yourself to explore new places and environments. But sometimes the homeless can be scary as they plop themselves down anywhere/ I saw a woman screaming at everyone that looked at her! There are a lot of museums, high income apartments, and more to see. The people here are so nice. They have stopped for me at the crosswalks and I even asked a sheriff deputy for directions. He asked me where I was from and even suggested a couple of museums to visit! I do not really venture out at nite when I travel, so I can not offer an honest review on the nightlife here>.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/840martae
40,Downtown LA reminds me of NYC,"The historic part of downtown Los Angelos reminds me of New York City and is probably the reason why all the early silent films used this as a stand in for NYC when they could not film there. The whole downtown is going through a major gentrification and will look totally different in about a year or two. It seems that everyone is moving back downtown and businesses are opening like crazy there or renovating buildings. When visiting the downtown area for the museums, drive around the downtown and see all the changes going on there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R4960NKjustinw
40,Different LA,"Interesting and very different part of LA. Financial buildings, glass skyscrapers, Walt Disney Concert Hall, Bradbury building, LA Times building and many more.. it's worth the visit. The driving and parking might not be the easiest, especially during the rush hour but there are meters on the streets or paid parking close to the Walt Disney Concert Hall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/articok
40,An interesting walk for architecture and TV/movie buffs,"This part of downtown Los Angeles has some great examples of early-to-mid 20th century architecture, including some excellent Art Deco buildings (many sadly empty and in disrepair, waiting for someone to save them from neglect). As you walk around this part of town, be sure to look up as well as ahead, and you will be surprised at the intricate details and beauty of the construction. You will also recognize many landmarks from television shows and movies",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dunadan
30,queit at night,"I loved walking around this area, but not a good place at night. As a single woman I was told not to even walk the half block to my hotel from the parking garage. They have cleaned up the area quite a bit, but danger still lurks. I found there was not a lot to do at night. I stayed downtown as it was closer to the Staples Center, and that is where I found some things to do at night. That area is great if there is an event at the Staples Center, but on off nights it is also quiet. Next time I will not stay downtown, but would pay the extra money to stay closer to the Staples Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveljo1988
50,Look Up and Look Around: Downtown LA is Amazing,"Central LA, especially South Broadway between 9th & 3rd streets showcases a stream of classical Art Deco buildings, some granted, needing a lot of TLC but still amazing nonetheless. and right in the middle of the jewellery districts",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VKMicle
40,You feel yourself in a movie,Walk in Downtown LA is walk through history looking into old and historical buildings and at the same time through films. Each step will remind you of some Hollywood film or scene and will lead you to it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jo_opaulof651
20,Don't Walk!,"Downtown LA is a mix of extreme poverty and extreme wealth. For a small part of downtown you get to see this nice tall buildings and well taken care of buildings with really high rent. Restaurants and bars all over the place.On the other hand you have the ugly part of downtown that spreads its webs all over the place! You got tent communities just taking over the sidewalks and living there. For gods sake! This is Los Angeles, this should not happen in the US. Every corner and every pen had homeless people there. Some clearly were mentally ill people just screaming and acting quite erratic.I recommend you stick to the middle of downtown and that you can it everywhere. The place seems dangerous and will make you feel unsafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luiscX4398ZK
30,Not excited,"Other than staples and disney hall, never really had the need nor want to spend time here. Did a day trip to check it out. Interesting to sit on the Hop on hop off to look around, but still nothing jumped out to say 'come look at me'.Still dont think Ive missed anything. Seems to be a large homeless contingent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrishC627
20,Concrete as afar as the eye can see,"Really not much to see except concrete buildings, concrete paving and concrete roads. Little shade, no cafes that we could find, event a car and head out of town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/862MelissaM
40,Actually interesting stuff,"Downtown LA actually has a lot of interesting architecture, facilities and sights to see. There are tours you can take to fill you in on the buildings, architecture, even the electric signage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chingachgook
50,Delightful Downton,"Downtown LA is a great architectural place with lots of skyscrapers overlooking a diverse and vast city which is a hub of activity and a true gem in Southern California. Between the shops, eateries and skyscrapers tourists are immersed in the smells and sights of downtown daily life and work all around them. A must visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/643ricz
30,Standard Classic Downtown ...,"For me there's no much to get excited about in this defined area except a few notable restaurants. A maze of buildings with no uber spectacular amongst them. Better to spend your time on Grand Ave. for MOCA, the Broad, Disney Center and the Music Center venues. Definitely not a place to be at night. Beware. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
50,Stunning Architecture!,"I love Architecture & DTLA is home to some of my favourite era's in design. My favourite building in all of DTLA is by far the Eastern Columbia Building. All the theatres have so much beauty and charm. You can spend an entire day easily, just perusing the streets and admiring the buildings this city houses. The best thing to do is just look up. It's so beautiful. Download the free map from the Los Angeles Conservancy website and be prepared to be wowed. Truly amazing architecture!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RPK89
40,Nice Tour,We saw this from a hop on hop off bus tour. Lots of interesing points regarding architecture and of course filming. We have been here twice now and not once have we seen anything filming or a famous person :( Good to learn about.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karens429
40,Look up folks!,Take advantage of the fantastic old architecture of downtown Los Angeles. Stop looking at your smartphone and LOOK UP! So much fine art to be seen for free. Many of the old buildings are being refurbished and brought back to their former glory.Walk around. Look around. Stop and eat at one of the gazillion places downtown. Go shopping. Enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolelynns
40,Better than expected!,"I was always told that Downtown LA has nothing to offer! Well it was a lie!. I really enjoyed a Sunday morning walking around. You can find modern and old architecture. Must see: Walt Disney Concert Hall, LA Cathedral and Town Hall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cesar_mtm
20,Not one of LA's finest,"As much as I love the city where I was born, I will not fantasize about Historic Downtown. It is a pretty sight at night with it being all lit up and during the day it’s not that bad with the tall skyscrapers on every side and decent food but I wouldn’t walk around downtown at night. That being said, which big city doesn’t have its homeless? It’s worth a visit just to say you’ve been there but LA has much to offer and Historic Downtown is not a place to boast about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3743BSdaniela
30,Not my first priority,We had been to LA several times and never found the CBD. We ended up in the Downtown Historic District. It was pretty smelly and not very clean and there were many beggars on the street. Admittedly it was a Sunday but not many places seemed to be open and there weren't many people around. I'm glad we went there but I wouldn't make it my first priority.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/848helenp
10,You must be kidding,Do not go there. Honestly there is not much more to say - you will spend an hour getting there to see nothing. Chinatown and Japan town have nothing to offer and can easily be rivalled with their counterparts anywhere else in the world. The downtown is seriously lacking in atmosphere and only has federal building and news agencies - everyone looks miserable on top of that. total waste of day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anic01
30,Good and bad,"Was nice to walk around and see some of the old buildings, found a great little coffee shop, navigation was a little hard and the constant being asked for money put us off a little but was other wise good to see",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zerhara
30,Nice but nothing historic about it...,"We took a city tout of the downtown area and enjoyed the few hours we spent there. That being said, it is nothing like other major cities in the United States as the buildings and architecture do not really have too much flare about them I'm glad we got to see it but I don't personally think it is a must do in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveRainville99
50,Multi-Cultural Experience,"There is a renaissance going on Downtown! Although the grand old movie theaters are now converted into businesses, there is an array of restaurants from taco stands to high-end, fine dining! I love the mix of cultures! Downtown is a rich experience, fascinating to people-watch and do not be afraid! People of all cultures gather and everyone who shops and eats downtown are what makes it so wonderful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SacMax
40,Wouldn't Return,"We ventured into the city, which was ok but we wouldn't return. Some nice building & shops, but like most cities some run down areas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SixtyOne
40,Lived here for 2 weeks,I lived in this area of downtown recently for 2 weeks and never had any problems and enjoyed the local neighborhoods. There are homeless people but every big city has that. I wouldnt walk late at night but besides that just get out and enjoy the neighborhood and see what is around you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Byrondwyer
40,Downtown has it all,"From the Pioneer Past to the new construction. All within a few blocks. The diversity in LA is at your finger tips. Explore the Pioneer Village, the outdoor market, and catch lunch on the street. Then head on to other sights, including the AmTrak station and marvel at what once was the gateway to the city. On over a few blocks you will find the new business center, the Walt Disney Concert hall,, plus an exciting indoor market that has served the city for many years.The metro works great - use it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geezegood
20,Poor,Really was expecting something better than what the downtown of one of the world's biggest and most famous city had to offer. Nothing special to it and the atmosphere is close to none.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JiaMTL
50,Fun!,"Lots of activities, shows, sights, & restaurants in the area--LA Live, Staples Center, Music Center, Olvera Street area, Chinatown, Little Tokyo, Ice skating, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexander5431
20,Stay clear!,"From what I saw, there was one good street in Downtown LA and the rest is barren and dangerous to be walking around alone in the evenings. I witnessed fights and a car crash in the 5hrs I was there! I'm sure there are nice areas but I didn't see many. Even between Hollywood and LA there is a massive difference in the feel and aura of the place, if you are only here for a few days stick to Hollywood and the beaches as there isn't much point getting down to Downtown.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tom131288
30,Safer and nicer now,"Not as good as other large city downtowns, but this area is getting better and better every year. Very diverse set of buildings and a lot of renovations going on, It might compete well with some of the better large city downtowns if the beautification keeps up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeMc666
50,"At a minimum, tour the Theatre District","I had done a film location tour with Starline that brought us to the Theatre District so I came back on my own for my last morning in Los Angeles. I could not resist walking down Broadway past the great architecture that is the Broadway of Los Angeles. I don't think my review will do it justice. From the Bradbury Building to the Million Dollar Theatre to Urban Outfitters which has tastefully converted the old Rialto Theatre into a retail outlet. I appreciate their effort to reclaim this old building (not sure how others feel about it but it was great to see it brought to life). Like another reviewer, I took the Metro Line to Union and then walked from there past the courts, LA Times etc. Wish I could have taken more time to divert to the Garment District etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethg156
50,"Olvera Street, Los Angeles CA","A Must-See for me when we are in Los Angeles, CA is the historic Olvera Street Placita. It is like walking back in time to Mexico in the early 1900s. It's a block-long plaza filled with amazing Mexican items and scrumptious, authentic food: hand-made corn tortillas, mouth-watering tacos, taquitos with green salsa, enchiladas with the best red sauce I have ever tasted, except for mom's, of course! One can buy the very affordable food at any of the small stands that line the Placita, a la carte or a full meal, but there are also several full-service, large restaurants in the middle of the plaza, with views of passersby, musicians, dancers, etc. The colors while walking through the street are bright and cheerful, just what anyone would imagine finding in a small viIlage in Mexico. There are many stalls with handmade clothing, souvenirs, leather goods, candy, toys, etc. But it is the food that draws millions of visitors to this little ""pueblito"", right downtown and a block away from the civic center where all the government buildings stand tall and impressive. There are also beautiful murals everywhere and historic artifacts housed in the middle of the plaza. Check out the museum with Diego Rivera's recently restored mural, outside, on the top floor of the museum. Oh! Don't pass Mr. Churro's store, located in the middle of the plaza, inside the structure by El Paseo Inn; these churros took me back to my childhood, when as children, it was a treat to eat them along with a hot cup of chocolate on cold days! Yumm! They are sold plain or stuffed with lots of delicious fillings! The food and items are reasonable and the vendors, servers and others aim to please! A great way to spend a day, especially if you go on the weekends when there are regional dancers, including the Aztec dancers in the middle plaza! Also check out the old Adobe House! I can't wait to return!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rod789
30,Great for just walking around.,This is a great place to just walk around and soak up the sights. The buildings range from the oldest in LA to some of the most modern. Well worth a stroll around for those with time on their hands.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TOM-C--LIVERPOOL

50,Walk of History,"Walking in this downtown historic district you will see the famous ""Fashion District"", ""Financial District"", ""Jewelry District"", etc. . . It is amazing to visit these sites and relive the history that has made Los Angeles. The architecture of the buildings was impressive and beautiful. There are several old theaters that have been restored. If you go on a weekend you may find yourself in the middle of a carnival or festival celebrating one of the many cultures represented in this city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sjwright
50,Native Playing Tourist,"As Southern CA natives, my husband and I took a day to escape to something different. Taking advantage of the MetroLink $10 day pass, we rode the train into Union Station with plans to walk to the historic district of 7th Street for a self-guided tour (www.laconservancy.org). Union Station was beyond description in beauty and architecture. After checking out the station, we went to the information booth to ask for the safest walking route. The friendly attendant advised us to take the RedLine (subway), which was safer and more direct. The RedLine ( included in the $10 pass promotion) was a bit confusing going through turnstiles. Some locals guided us through. We felt safe on the train, and the stops were clearly marked and announced. The tour we had printed out was exactly what we hoped for. We discovered being across the street from the buildings you are reading about made it a lot more enjoyable. We had lunch at Jimmy Johns (www.jimmyjohns.com) and watched the activity on the street from a window seat. After our tour, we walked up to Beacon Hill, then down to the un-renovated Angels Flight (www.angelsflight.com). From there we caught the subway back to Union Station. Our plans were to dine in or around Olivera Street (www.olvera-street.com). I was very disappointed that it is just a tourist attraction, and the dining offered was either expensive, cash only, or just a counter top order window. There was not many restaurants in the area. We finally followed a sign painted on the side of a building to a BBQ joint (http://sssmokehouse.com). BBQ was good, prices were high for drinks. Taking the train to and from LA was smooth sailing. The subway was a bit confusing just getting into the terminals, but otherwise, it was a very enjoyable day and location to play tourist.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samesmindy
40,Nice place to stay,"This is a nice area in LA, which may be liked by business travelers as well as by tourists, to stay. This area is very well connected to other parts of LA by metro bus. However, local guidance may be required to get tips about effective utilization of bus service for commuting. There are plenty of good hotels & restaurants located in this area, within walking distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Prasanna1965
40,Watch it change before your eyes!,"Back in the 70s and 80s, we kept hearing that Downtown LA was ""coming back"". Well, finally it has, and it is changing day-by-day. There's even plans to open a Trader Joe's there soon. Grand Central Market has been overhauled. There was many first rate places to eat. The monthly art walk is filled with people pouring out over the streets. Several of the beautiful old theaters on Broadway had been restored. My favorite part right now is the old Bank District, which has become quite gentrified. It's proximity to skid row, however, sometimes give the occasion to play ""homeless or hipster"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachilde
50,A place we really warmed up to over 6 days,"Our first impression, I have to admit, was not good. I had been to downtown LA many times over the years for business, but rarely stayed long enough to see more than a hotel room, a meeting room, and a cab ride to the airport. This time we stayed at the Millennium Biltmore hotel for 6 days surrounding a 3 day conference. That gave us a lot of time to explore the area.On our first walk during the day around the old downtown, we were struck by the number of closed and dilapidated store fronts, and the many shops selling cheap clothes and electronics. There are many homeless people on the streets and we were accosted many times by people asking for money. At least once per block of the walk. The more days we spent, the more we came to appreciate the mix of this changing area. Many people are moving back downtown, creating a market for many restaurants at many points along the price range. There are shops selling candies and baked goods, wine and specialty cheeses and meats, outdoor cafes and coffee shops, and street buskers and hawkers of many types. We found book stores and antique shops and many other interesting places to hunt and poke around. The people asking for handouts are still there, but a polite refusal deals with that and no one causes any harm. That is a sad reality in our midst and we would do well to figure out a better way to help people back on their feet.By the end of our stay we enjoyed discovering more nooks and crannies of this town, and wondered if the mix of income levels can be sustained. There is a need for more accommodations for the homeless and low income, while increasing the number of young professionals and working people that bring economic vitality.It is an easy walk to areas like bunker hill and the public library, the Grand Central market with restaurants and fruit and vegetable vendors. Come and visit, and stay a few extra days. There are many cheap and easy public transportation options to visit favorite LA area attractions like the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Hollywood, the various studios, and get out to Santa Monica or Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pkrissel
30,Walk around in the morning or evening,"We made the mistake of going in the middle of the day and it was so hot so we didn't get to walk around as much as we wanted. Our highlights were the City Hall and the Disney Concert Hall. I'm not sure why they call it historic district, there isn't much left of anything you could describe as historic. It seems this area is pretty rebuilt.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IOGWFH

Cathedral and Disney Hall show the more contemporary era in the area. Downtown continues to gentrify. Clash of cultures, (panhandlers) and those who work and/or live in the area continues, however IMO generally there is peaceful coexistence.At Christmas, added benefits are the Pershing Square ice skating rink, Large indoor Biltmore tree and decorations, sometimes an elaborate toy train setup at the Bonaventure and the large Christmas tree at 7th & Figueroa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/packcal
40,a glimpse inside intriguing crumbling Theaters--,"9.28.13 - saw a joint production by a Dutch & local theatre group ""Hospital"" in the historical Tower Theatre. This one is really old with peeling paint, musty old carpeting, dark and spooky now but must have been glamourous in its hey days in the 1920s. I envision be-jeweled ladies and dapper gentlemen sailing down the sweeping marble stairs. Can you smell their perfume and see cigar smoke warfing in the air?9.29.13 - saw an outstanding eclectic production by Lemi Ponifasio/Mau ""Stones in her Mouth"" performed by a very dynamic all female cast of Samoa New Zealand group, in the Palace Theatre. Both events was part of RADAR LA, designed to reignite interests in the downtown historic core to ""revitalize these architectural treasures.""Check out these rarely seen interior photos.

This walking tour may take 4~6 hours including one hour lunch and one and half hours for Symphonian tour.

Grand Park is recently completed; it is new and beautiful. It also has modern and clean public restrooms.As you walk toward to City Hall, please note you will enter from the public entrance, which is at 201 Main Street (the backside) to get to Observation Deck at City Hall.

After you are finished looking at the pictures, you will walk up a grand staircase to the Observation level on the 27th floor. Most of the level is an open space filled with chairs and a podium. It's interesting to imagine what sort of conferences or meetings might occur from this vantage point overlooking the city. You can go outside on this level and walk around the perimeter of the floor. The view is great, and there are signs to let you know what's where.Observation Deck may be closed if there were any meetings in sessions.3.

This tour includes architectural highlights and a historical overview of The Music Center. It takes visitors into all four venues, including the Ahmanson Theatre, the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the Mark Taper Forum and the Walt Disney Concert Hall, as available.

40,Hustle and Bustle,"Typical big city... lots of people and lots of traffic.Definitely lots to do for everyone....and most interesting to watch people... It was on my bucket list and on a stop over to Australia, so we spent a few days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClemsonTiger1996
30,A different side to LA,We got to downtown LA by a tour. There were many interesting area to explore. I would have like to spent more time here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/inthegarden
40,Better Understood On Foot,"I was born and raised in L.A. and learned more about downtown on foot. You lose most of the experience when you're driving. There's a lot to see and everything cannot be seen in a day. I would recommend taking the bus around to avoid huge parking fees. The transit authorities have provided DASH buses that travel most major city streets for 25 cents! The high parking fees discourage a lot of people from visiting downtown. The oldest part of L.A. is the Northern part around Chinatown where there are shops, restaurants, and lots of people. Olvera Street, farther South and across the street from the L.A. Union Station is also a historical landmark. Interesting folks everywhere. Homeless people are usually in the parks or grassy areas around public buildings, so be prepared. You will see more of the homeless towards the East side of downtown and less towards the west where there are more upscaled highrises and condos. L.A.'s Civic Center is beautiful with a recently renovated City Hall which was once the city's tallest building-you can take a ride on an elevator to the 27th floor to the observation deck free of charge where there is lots to see of this sprawling city. Little Tokyo is approx. 1 block Southeast. with more cafes and shops. I suggest getting a map and wearing your most comfortable walking shoes. Downtown L.A. was built around cars. The most pedestrians you will see are going to their cars or public transit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/George316
50,Start with Downtown LA and work outwards...,"This size of Downtown takes some understanding but using the sw-ne axis Metro trains helps cover the bigger distances, leaving local walks, at least the north-south ones, for exploring individual blocks and areas.At first there does not seem to be much logic as to what to expect to find at ground level and there isn't really. Some blocks have few shops or amenities at ground level, others many. Generally and it is generally, I found the whole eastern side of Downtown to be somewhat run down at street level with some fairly desperate shops and individuals to be seen. My guide book suggested Downtown could be covered off in a day: yes it could by skipping meal breaks and ending up with sore feet. Two/three days more realistic.The juxtaposition of hotels, restaurants, some retailing and distinguished buildings makes for more interesting walks in the central, northern and western portions. Worth going there if only to see City Hall and environs, Union station, the LA County LIbrary and the Biltmore Hotel. And wait for the white hand sign to appear before crossing the roads, if you're from, 'Out of town.'",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StephenJ62

30,Undergoing change,"This was my first visit to downtown LA & I expected to be scared and surrounded by filth and buildings falling down & it was the opposite. The area is surrounded by some sketchy neighborhoods like any major city, but the areas they are working to revitalize were fine. Chic, urban residences, LA Live is bustling with restaurant & excitement, parks, shopping, lots of parking that isn't too expensive. It's a unique down town, more of a small town feel and not a lot of foot traffic & shops compared to NYC or Chicago. Plenty of public transportation & cabs. There are expensive 4-5 star hotels but some very nice options for around $100 and they seemed safe and secure. Nice to explore the architecture & history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheGlimmerTwins

50,Visit and explore,"Come on a weekday to get the most effect here. Get a good parking spot and just walk up and down all of the streets. You can visit a gallery here and there, some shopping and lots of new cafes and restaurants have popped up. Look up some historical sites on the internet and pop in for a visit. There are actually so many places to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/livasida
50,"Odd, intriguing, fascinating","Downtown LA is not an easy place. As anything in LA, it is big, and may take much more than expected to get to see. The vast size of everything and disturbingly low level of movement (compared to, say, downtown NYC, London or Hong Kong... actually, any other rich world large cities) contrast the intense experience hidden here. There are many attractions (Disney Hall, Museums, parks, the Library) and fascinating architecture, ranging from Art Deco to the most modernist (simply unique: the Westin hotel). LA hides incredible surprises. On the positive side, there are precious restaurants and cafés, for instance, Bottega Louie (on the 7th st) and a vibrant market (Grand Market, visited mostly by working class Latinos who go there for unexpensive and tasty lunches. Try Mexican meals!). On the other side, you'll find a shocking abundance of homeless people in certain areas and a intriguing sense of void (i.e. Pershing Square) . Sometimes you'll think the zombie apocalypse may have already started. Visiting Downtown LA was a rather philosophical experience. A must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaboSantiago_Chile
40,Well worth visiting,"LA is not somewhere you think of visiting a historic area but we enjoyed our visit here. We went to the Bradbury Building, rode up Angels Flight, went to the Wells Fargo Museun, walked around the Disney Concert Hall, looked at City Hall, strolled down Olvera Street and then went to Union Station to catch the subway to Hollywood. The only cost was 50cents for the Angels Flight and we thoroughly enjoyed seeing the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shellsb
50,"Fine, Faux, Funk, Wholesale District, What a DeLite and Deal!","I was headed to downtown Los Angeles to have a deja vu moment by visiting Angel's Flight - the shortest cable car ride in the world, The Disney Concert Hall and Olivera Street for a bit of early California. After all, I WAS born in LaLa Land! However, I made a turn into The Wholesale District and had an incredible experience that lasted all afternoon.I wanted to buy some hat trim and had the most fun afternoon. My first stop was an emporium of jewels where the diamonds dazzled and the gold shimmered. The ""Jools"" were vast in their arrayand I moved on because I wanted hat trim such as flowers, ribbons and netting. I asked along the way passing lots of interesting vendors. It was kind of like Ali Baba's Bizarre Bazaar.My first ribbons were purchased in a really tiny cubby hole with ribbons of many colors like Joseph and his coat. The ribbons reached the ceiling and I had to sort of shoulder my way around as there was a feeling that I might, just might make something topple. Not so, the people were very nice and had ways of reaching up to get out-of-reach ribbons in my hands. When it was time to pay, I paid like three dollars, YEA!My feet led me past dazzling displaying of fabrics leaned up outside the shops. As I trotted along I saw shops that glistened with gorgeous strands of crystal beads and lustrous pearls in soft, muted colors with lots of gold chains and findings for beading fanatics. I still needed to find more hat goodies so I asked a lady walking by if she knew of a good place. She had me follow her and I was in ribbon nirvana at prices that were unbelievable. She bought what she wanted and told me that she made pillows. I picked out about six types of ribbon and was thrilled as they too were a treasure., The owner of the store was rather corpulent and swarthy plus he was really nice. He told me he was an Iranian Jew and wanted to know if I'd like to buy a babushka or some such thing. He showed me a lovely top that was laser woven like a tube with fringe on both ends. I got it for better than wholesale! It made my wallet $5.00 lighter...SUCH A DEAL!From there I passed a store that had huge animal skins hanging outside and more beautiful fabrics. As I wended my way I kept smelling grilled onions and bell peppers that would top bacon wrapped hot dogs. I was getting hungry but pushed on. Finally, my nose won out and I ate a dog right then and there. It was a treat I probably won't eat again, I was happy.Most of the displays are rather colorful and very enticing. There were fabrics I would have lovedto put in my already groaning suit case. I was mesmerized by the patterns, colors, and designs, I conjured new outfits for Opening Night of the San Francisco Opera and new silken bedcovers and draperies. What fun.Then I happened into a rabbit wren of shops selling everything from Quincinera gowns and hoop skirts. I wanted to by a hoop skirt and make it into a canopy over my bed, of course I'd buy beads and ribbons to embellish it with. It will be a future fun project. In this maze of shops I found lovely white dresses for girls making their First Holy Communion, the dresses were a heart's delight. There were places to by bridal gowns, golden tiaras, bridal gloves, guest books, slippers that would please any bride, faux rose petals for adorable little girls to scatter along the aisle of a great cathedral, or garden path.Moving on I found a place filled to the gunnels with Indian trinkets that glistened and glittered with all the colors of paradise. There were so many gold necklaces with brilliant faux jools the size of the Hope Diamond. There were saris and incense sticks and bolts of sari fabrics for the DIY, plus there were huge, colorful glass globes that a swami would love. The Indian slippers were embroidered and jeweled, fit for a princess.Then there were huge displays of colorful faux designer style hand bags that climbed to the sky. They had some kind of implement for reaching them. They were nicely priced for those who wished a bit of glam for a few sous.If I had a steamer trunk I could have filled it with wonderful linens for all parts of the home. There were luxurious satin bed covers, beautiful acrylic waste cans, magazine holders, bed trays and vanity items. The bed linens were sophisticated and stylish as were the bath towels and robes. Plus, somewhere near, I had seen some gorgeous mirrors that looked like they came from Murano.The neat thing about visiting the Wholesale District is you can buy a lot for a little. Also, some of the shops are very well done as if they were on Robinson in Beverly Hills. The displays of fabric are truly fit for a palace.You will also see some very special old theaters such as the Los Angeles Theater that looks like it came from some grand villa or a sound stage in Hollywood. Yes, L.A. is colorful if a bit scruffy but you will find the pearls among the swine.One thing is for sure, I will go back as soon as possible",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/QUEENIE_ELLE
