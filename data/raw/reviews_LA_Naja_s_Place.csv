50,Felt like a local,Great place for locals or tourists. Big selection of craft beers. Extremely friendly service. Great bar conversation. Free parking. They have food or plenty of restaurants in walking distance. I will definitely return!,Rather_Nomadic
50,Local Pub,"If you need an escape to the most rudimentary of dockside hangouts with zero frills, mostly fried snack foods and endless excellent beer choices, many on tap, bare to the bones Naja’s is your place. Chock full of local color, live music most weekends and harbor views, this rustic hangout serves up the hottest selection of the coolest beers for miles. Gas up the SeaDoo or just grab your oldest flip flops and meet us at Naja’s!",LaTourMimi
40,Pretty cool place,Stopped in for a drink and pretty cool just sitting on the boardwalk watching the sunset. Imagine this place goes off at night.,Jenny R
30,Great way to pass a weekend afternoon!,"Great beer selection, but the service is very slow for food. The music is fun and loud (although not that good). Very fun atmosphere!",Lori W
40,"Local ""Dive"" Bar with Large Beer Selection","If you love beer and want to experience the Redondo Beach Pier the way locals do then add a visit here to your list. I give it a ""Very Good"" rating because the beer selection is huge, over 80 on tap in addition to hundreds of bottles to choose from. This place has been in business since the 1980s and while it has grown larger the decor and vibe remain largely the same. It's no-nonsense beach vibe may not be for everyone but most locals love it for what it is (a great bar on the pier) and on any given summer weekend this small space is usually packed.",Christine L
40,Dive bar with great beer selections and a view.,Naja's is a classic dive bar located at the Redondo Pier. Lots of beers on tap and there are great bands that play there on most days/evenings. Food is ok but the views and atmosphere are great.,Kevin B
