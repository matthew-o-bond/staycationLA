50,Great For a Stroll,"We walked from Third Street Promenade to Santa Monica Pier and we had a wonderful time. Gorgeous views, good eats, and a nice little amusement park. I'd recommend going at sunset for the scenery and so that everything starts to light up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spoopty
50,Exciting,"On the west of LA, this is a nice attraction for tourists and local people. It is located on Ocean avenue and facing the Pacific ocean. The pier has many attractions for the visitors including amusement parks, restaurants & cafes, souvenir shops and areas for fishing. You can easily spend hours there and have excellent views of the ocean & beaches.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cp_0010
30,Tired and need of update,"Like much of LA, full of homeless and people with issues. Tired attractions. Only thing worth it was some ice cream shops and the Route 66 shop. But this is at least safer than Venice Beach - now that is a dump. Never going again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sparky59canberra
50,CoronaTherapy,"Although the beach had only recently been reopened, there were quite a few people enjoying the weather. Strolling under the boardwalk and splashing in the waves was much-needed therapy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kvne11
50,Tourism,Loved the walk by the pier. Great place to spend the evening. Serene beautiful no words to describe . Love the place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shetty782019
20,Waste of time,It's just appear at a public beach what's the typical way too expensive crappy restaurant at the end. It has a few carnival-type rides the Entertainer kids that aren't interested in seeing the natural beauty surrounding them. Stop by once to say you were there and then get out. Walk along the beach where it's enjoyable,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OldProChef
50,Fun place to go,"Pretty obvious, when in Santa Monica you have to visit the pier. It's full of great little shops, street performers and amazing views over the ocean and beachfront.We visited here with the intention of spending the afternoon in Santa Moncia and walked here from Venice.The pier was very busy and bustling and you are spoilt for choice if you want some Santa Monica merchandise.When we visited the Aquarium and some of the outdoor restaurants were closed do the fires which you could see in the distance and the hills but it didn't take away from a great afternoon over the water.There is a mini theme park on this pier which, unless you but wrist bands or cards you will pay an arm and a leg to visit. the rides for individuals are expensive so takee that into account when planning your spending money here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonotDreamJustTravel
40,"Love the pier, touristy","Fun to walk around, see the nice view. Very touristy, only touristy shops on the pier, but a must see for visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eostrows
50,"Nice pier, expensive parking",This pier is full of people any time of the year or any time of the day. But you will enjoy the vibe and the atmosphere near the beach with people doing random things on the street. You can find pretty good restaurants with good enough food. Buba shrimp is a favourite. Listen to random music by random street musicians. Breathtaking view of the sunset and the nice breeze of the ocean. Parking Charges are sky high!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeyPorgeyPandP
40,Fun on the Pier,"Each time we are in the area we head to Santa Monica Pier. We have visited both day and night and love both. The kids like the amusement park area and mum and dad like just strolling along people watching and browsing the stores and buskers. Always stop and have a meal at Bubba Gumps and walk to the end of the pier. You can access the beach and under the pier from just next to Bubba Gumps. Nighttime is the better atmosphere due to the lights. While visiting the area check out the next two blocks up from the pier and along the beach strip for great restuarants, bars and shopping. We have spotted a few celebs in the area also. Great place for everyone with something for all ages. The entry to the Pier is free and you can buy a wristband for rides. If open, check out the old carosel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/genjagt73
30,Fun boardwalk,Fun little walk around the infamous pier. Ample parking nearby. Lots of homeless people though as with a lot of this area but they weren’t really bothering anyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairemeech
50,A fun place to walk!,"We really enjoyed several walks along the pier, particularly in the evening at sunset. Really atmospheric and great fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tauntonholidayers

40,A trip back in time,"I've seen this on TV but great to see in person. The wooden pier is all a pier should be. Lots of entertainment with Superman on your way onto the pier, Musicians and singers, magician, and the opportunity to have your name on a piece of rice, have your photograph taken eating outlets, coffee shops an opportunity to fish and all that without mentioning the big wheel, roller coaster and other rides. When we were there it was sunny and it was great just to sit along the pier and people watch on the beach and the promenade.The one area the pier could better is the providing a safer passage along the pier as the sleepers are uneven and you could trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HughMc
50,Iconic and breezy,"The SM Pier is what's left of a bygone era that included ""Pacific Ocean Park"". Even if you aren't interested in dining or riding the awesome carousel, or even shopping, the stroll down to the end where people still fish is worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/177kathleenm
50,Exactly what you expect from a Pier,"This pier was great and exactly what I expected to get from a pier. Great atmosphere for all ages!!!! The rides were reasonable priced, as were the games. They offered every ""carnival"" type of food you would want to see, along with more than a few options for sit in eating. Pleasantly surprised.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmitchell23
50,Fun nostalgia,"My wife and i had never been, but of course saw it in movies or on tv. Mid week during the coronavirus scare meant lines were short and crowds were manageable. We just walked to the end and road the ferris wheel and rollercoaster both enjoyable. The weather had been stupid rainy the whole drive down... then... perfect 65 and sunny. Gotta checkout at least once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeoffreyB800
30,Meh....Its not bad,"Well the area is cool, the pier is a bit crowded. Its a carnival on the beach. Very touristy with many street vendors, selling food and singing. Not the place to go if your'er looking for piece and quiet. The pier does look cool at night as the rides are illuminated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CMAC2828
30,A bit run down,The pier needs a bit of TLC but it nice for a saunter. There are is an amusement arcade and some stalls but not a great deal of interest.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Garthess
50,Fantastic,Loved this place. Was very busy but was relaxing at the same time. We went on the carousel which was great fun,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/761valm
40,Carnival atmosphere,"If you like carnivals, you'll like the Santa Monica Pier. Parking can be a problem - bring lots of quarters. Some of the musicians were quite good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1Wisetraveller
50,Great place to visit,"Only in LA for a couple of days. First day we went it was cold and rainy, but still had fun, also went around the area, shops etc. Eat at the Cheesecake Factory for our evening meal. Lively area, one of the best places to visit in LA. Went back on our last day before we flew home as it was 80% and wanted to see ot in the sunshine, brilliant",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tinkerbell1105
40,Lively and fun,"We made a quick stop on our way to L.A. and walked the length of the pier. There are rides, vendors selling all types of souvenirs, buskers playing music and singing. There's also many places to eat. Lots of great photo opportunities and a beautiful beach for kiddies to play on! It's a fun, lively place to spend a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/148sandrac148
10,Don’t recommend,Paid $20 to park and waited forever to get a spot and the pier is crowded and smells terrible not a fan at all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lisasinpa
50,Love this funky alive pier,"I think one of my favorite LA places. Very funky. Skillo, ticky tacky, dancers, jugglers, singers, musicians, ferry’s wheel, carousel. Great for people watching. Go, go!! Great Mexican restaurant there on the pier!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AuntTink
50,Fun night,It's worth paying for the unlimited rides here as you get your value after a couple of rides. A fun night out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agt96
40,A nice visit on a January morning,"We had a day to use when we suddenly decided not to go to Universal Studios, so went to the Pier as part of our fill the day plans. We had a nice couple of hours here, with good weather. We parked on the pier itself for a moderate fee. There were a few performers doing their things out on the pier though the only one I paid much attention to was the ukelele player, who played a tune at my request. Had a light lunch at the restaurant on the pier. The souvenir places were what you might expect and we found a few things for the family back home. I walked out on the sand and even went under the pier and out the other side. I half expected there to be shady characters down there but it was fine, and I felt safe walking through there. All in all a nice visit and glad we did it. Some say it is overrated but I dont have anything to compare, and thought it was just fine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NovaScotiabill
20,"Been here, Done that..that’s it..","For me as a solo tourist, it was just an okay experience of walking around the Santa Monica Pier.. Been here and done that kind of experience for me...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennyLWT79
50,Memorable stroll along Santa Monica pier and beach,"We definitely enjoyed our stroll along Sabra Monica pier and beach on a sunny March weekday. It’s definitely more of a touristic area, but it’s still a nice place to visit. There were some nice shops, but we were more interested in the beach. Not much of a crowd, so we took our time taking pics and walking along the cold water.It’s worth the visit if you’re visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexBou
30,Overrated,"We had never been to the Santa Monica Pier so while in Newport, we decided to check it out. It was not something I would need to do again. It is just a small carnival. Nothing special. People watching was interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/845LisaV
50,Sister trep,"The pier is like the pictures, the Ferris wheel and end of Route 66. A fun place to visit and say you have been there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MerrieJoA
50,Fun stop!,"Very enjoyable but crowded. We went at night and getting into the area was super busy, but that goes with this area. Parking was super packed and hard to manuever around the lot and exit area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whatsupwiththat43299
30,Not great,"Contrary to what I’ve see. On tv and movies, the place was dead!!!! It’s good to go check it out and that’s it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/world_travellers15
30,Didn't stay long,We drove here from Disneyland because we wanted to see the ocean and this pier. It's cool that you can drive on the pier and park.It was just a walk to the end and back to the car. It seemed pretty dirty and a lot of homeless hanging out begging.There was some neat entertainment but overall unimpressive. One and done,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmcn80
40,Entertaining,"A bit like Blackpool some tat to buy, plenty of entertainment from street artist musicians and magicians.Good fun to watch",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/628philb
50,Santa Monica Pier,being in los angeles we have to come to this place and walk the pier of santa monica and buy a t-shirt of route 66,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EduardoC149
40,Get it on a good day,"Our first day in LA we spent it walking along Venice Beach all the way down to Santa Monica Pier. The sun was splitting the stones, muscle beach was full athletes working out, street music was playing and the place was full of life.Spent most of the afternoon on the pier after losing a small fortune in the arcade!Sitting down and having a cocktail while watching out into the ocean was just incredible.Didn’t have kids with us so we didn’t use the rides/attractions but it was really busy so I would take that as a sign they’re good? A spot not to be missed but bring a bottle of water with you if walking the beach .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/citytravels18
30,Nice Sunday afternoon,"Nice Sunday afternoon walk. Was my first time in the Pacific Ocean. the weather was chill still but many were on the water. I did not play any of the game because I am not a fanatic but many kids were having fun. Mexican are everywhere selling mango with lemon and salt my fave fruit, I couldn't get enough. A lot of family having fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yenyok
30,Lively,"Very busy but it was Presidents day, as a group of students with a huge banner let us all know.Nice old wooden pier with a fair gound addition, lots of outlets, food and tat, its easy to forget you are even on a pier. Good view of the beaches either side from the end. Have to walk off the pier really if you want a snap of the pier sign$7 to park car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gardengel-IoW
30,For the Tourist,Pier is mostly a one and done type of visit. Enjoyed some of the entertainment on the our and the views of the water. We even saw a seal! The pier itself is pretty small and overall very congested. Also there is a pretty decent number of homeless people within the area. I hope the city finds a way to help them!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellyf795
40,GTA V Vibes,"As many may know, the Santa Monica Pier is not only an entertaining and picturesque location, but also replicated in GTA V, probably for the reasons that I just listed. I enjoyed my visit to the Pier as it was cool to experience the location in real life and the atmosphere and activities were exciting. We didn't buy anything or ride the rollercoaster, but the views and music were worth it and we found a spot to sit down and take a break. Like the Venice Canals (see my other reviews) this is a staple of LA and should and could be visited at the same time as a trip to Venice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MR_Travels1920
30,We can say we’ve been...,"Loved Santa Monica, not so much the Pier, it’s on the list of once is enough experiences. Typical tourist trap, go and experience it, but don’t plan on staying long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatieRowlands
30,Good for the view but pretty ordinary,"Whilst you’re in LA there’s a few places you’ve got on your list and this is always one of them, but to be honest it’s not that fantastic. You’ll take your iconic shots and maybe ride the Ferris wheel and a walk down the pier but that’s about it. Lol the most fun thing we saw though was a Mexican man playing his guitar with a trump mask on-hilarious, and the musician was really good. Ferris wheel isnt cheap, you’d get better value if you wanted to do more rides and games there but we weren’t that interested. We had a five year old, 11 year old and 16 year old. The promenade and restaurants around the place are good, so if you visit explore the surrounding area too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VanessaM646
50,A charming place to spend an afternoon,I love the charm and ambient of the Santa Monica Pier. It’s a great place to go for a stroll for fresh air or to just look at the ocean. Try to go their before Sunset to catch some amazing views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AhmedWI
50,Absolutely stunning,Santa Monica pier was great fun and absolutely beautiful. Locals told us it's even better at night but we didn't get to experience it all lit up. There is plenty to see and so and we thoroughly enjoyed our time there. Highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LawyerBaeRenee
50,GREAT PIER PLENTY FOR THE FAMILY TO DO,"What a lovely place for a walk around , the Santa Monica Pier has plenty to do for all the family , bars , restaurants, arcade and the fair rides .

50,Santa Monica Pier,"Went to Santa Monica Pier for a walk. Very busy and happening place, a lot of gift shops and a lot of visitors and tourists along the pier. There are a lot of good seafood restaurants on the pier as well. There is also a theme park on the pier where kids and adults both can have fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pkh_travels
50,Best Night!,"Although it was our first night, It was a perfect one because of the pier. I had the mango flower that reminded me of our trip to Mexico City. Walking the pier, enjoying the view/night, taking pictures and eating the carnival food was a perfect night. ❣️",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/greysc2014
30,Fun People Watching,"It’s very touristy but also a great place to watch the sunset. You’ll see all types of people, so take a stroll and do some great people watching. If you’re there later in the day, be sure to stick around for the sunset!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ah64fish
40,An iconic structure featured in a number of films. Well worth a visit but.............,"This was a must see location for us as the Santa Monica Pier is iconic, appearing in a number of well known films. The various 'attractions' were pretty tacky but as one might expect from any similar amusement centre. Neverthe less glad we visited and thenn dipped our toes into a very cold Pacific Ocean!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaellK524GY
50,Very nice place for walking,Very nice place for walking. Weather is all year round perfect.Lots of shops and restaurants all over the place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmrAbdallah
50,Beautiful,"It was so great! We had a balast. There are so many shops for souvenirs. Although watch out for the hustlers when you try to go down the sidewalk. We had guys harassing us to buy their cd or make a donation. We told them no cash, but they have the square app! So we had to just keep moving on. There are talented people down by the pier though. We didnt go on the rides but you can pay for them individually if there's one you want to go on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mayhemmarissa
30,Another Pier,"If your in Santa Monica, it’s a pleasant walk out along the pier.Note there are 2 sides, one with the tatty Amusement Park, and then the right hand side, the long walk out to a building with a restaurant/ bar.It’s a good people watching venue which most non US visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScambusterSZ
50,A Blast from the Past,Loved it!!!!This adventure took me back to the small town where I grew up where every summer a street carnival would come to.town...Although the rides here are so much bigger and better than those from street carnivals the joyous feelings are the same.I would definitely do this again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anevah
50,Nice view,Just took a walk from Venice to the pier. Great place to spot many interesting people :) It’s a nice walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/henke054
10,I don't get the hype,"I only went there because it was the halfway point of my cross country and back road trip and the end of Route 66.I have traveled all throughout the country, except for the most northern states, and I'm just not fond of California.The pier is just a pier with restaurants, a few rides and a lot of very overpriced souvenir shops. I get that marijuana is legal for recreational use there, but if no one can smoke cigarettes on the pier, no one should be smoking joints either. I swear I ran into at least a half dozen people smoking joints while I went to the end and back. And then there was some guy dressed as a superhero trying to get in every picture I tried to take of the sign at the beginning of the pier. I just didn't like the whole experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/296williamsg
40,Must visit!,I would recommend visiting this pier for the Beautiful sunset view.It also has an arcade place. There’s daily entertainment along the pier.If you’re visiting the Santa Monica area you need to pass by the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amna_yk66
40,Photo op location,"Great sea views, with a small outdoor theme park (Pacific Park, which looks old btw), huge beach (too cold though for beach activities and it doesn’t look very clean with the very many birds, seagulls flying around), little touristy cart stalls along the stretch of the pier, restaurants and many talented buskers from singing to dancing to drawing.Overall a small place and can be covered in less than an hour if you don't go into the theme park. Could have been even faster if not for the 2 Korean girls taking their time to take countless photos at the Route 66 sign keeping many others like me, rolling our eyes in queue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dyhx
40,A nice stroll,A lovely stroll and necessary photo op. I stayed right by there so it was convenient. It really is just a short walk. Restaurants you would be better in and around Santa Monica for selection.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/notions
40,You don’t have to fish to enjoy the pier!,This was a fun afternoon! The fishing pier was very clean and the bathrooms were Very Clean. Kudos to the sweet lady on duty! Lots to do and see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gablairin
50,A Good Vibe for a Tourist Spot,"I am with a group of artists that go around L.A. and do plain aire paintings, and we spent the morning on the SM pier. Nice people and clean are what come to mind. Most of the people were out-of-towners looking at the beach and seagulls.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lynndds
40,Very interesting views and shows,This was one of my best ever spots to visit at early morning to enjoy the nice views of the ocean and watch the waves and the birds OR at night to watch the shows... the only bad thing was the smell of the weed smoke but some visitors.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mfattah1973
40,Tourist must see,"This is just one of those places you have to go visit when travelling to LA! We went at night, rode the roller coaster just for the fun of it (10$ a person). It was a fun carnival type of vibe. We spent about an hour there. Sure it's very tourist-y, but a lot of places in California are. It was not overcrowded though, we got to experience it withouth being overwhelmed by too many people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/milanc767
40,Entrainment and so much more,Along the pier you will find entertainers doing their best however some of them to stick with their day jobs. We got some really good cinnamon rolls with our coffee and sat outside the cafe to watch the world going by along the pier. We walked to the end of the pier looking for Forest Gumps shoes but did not find them till we had given up. They were in the most obvious place right by the entrance to Bubba Gump's Shrimp restaurant. It was not too busy while we were there it was a Wednesday midday. The seagulls were busy trying to find food and people were coming and going all the time.This would be a suitable visit for people of all ages and abilities although the lower area at the end of the pier has steep steps. You could spend all day here if you wanted.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/holiday-view23-7-11
50,MOVIE LOCATION PHOTOS! Beautiful sunsets!,"WE LOVE SANTA MONICA- its unique, a fabulous district for walking and shopping.

40,Great Place To Visit,"Very cool place to visit! From early morning until late in the evening, the views are astounding. There are a couple of sit down restaurants and a lot of grab and go food choices. It’s relaxed and the people are chill. The “amusement” park is pretty busy - rides are clean and the workers are nice. The beach is very clean. Can even walk along the ocean to Venice Beach and take in a whole different vibe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllthingsD
30,Miss the Old Days,"Thousands of tourists and locals enjoy visiting the pier. There are shops, restaurants and rides. But, I miss the pier as it was 50 or 60 years ago when I visited it as a little kid. Lots of Southern California attractions have gotten bigger and more popular, but bigger is not always better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sundancer93003

50,One of must visit places in Los Angeles Country!,Santa Monica coast in itself is gorgeous. It is a dream place to live for most. The pier is enjoyable with its attractions and the coast walking/bicycle track for length of kms is a delight along with the shopping district.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AEGEAN_MERMAID
50,Very lively and buzzing,The pier is just so lively and buzzing. Lots of food and shopping options. We even saw a school band come and do a performance they must have just been practicing but it was wonderful to watch. Parking is $10 and is cash only. All in all a great place to spend some time and has something to do for everyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PriyaV661
40,Amazing sunset spot,"The Santa Monica Pier is a shiny spot to visit, but it's a one-timer really. It is fun, and loud, and crowded, there is food, and magnets, and souvenirs, but it is so full that finding a free table is almost impossible, especially during the weekends. However, the sunsets are spectacular, I don't think I've seen anything quite like it. It makes the whole hustle with the crowd worthwhile, once you get that perfect sunset spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peseva

30,Disappointed,We went for lunch hoping to find a nice seafood restaurant. Sorry but Bubba Gumps doesn’t count. The Mexican restaurant at the end of the pier serves a delicious fish taco so it wasn’t all bad. There are amusement park rides but we didn’t go on any. The one that stood out was a circus trapeze venue that were I younger I would have tried.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Watsson
30,Very crowded and touristy,"If you enjoy the relaxation of a hometown pier, then this is not for you. Loads of out-of-town visitors crowded this attraction when we were there making it totally not enjoyable. In fact we couldn't wait to turn around and get off the pier and away to our next destination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/443randyl
40,It's iconic,We haven't been here that often but we have a good time when we do go there. The ferris wheel is worth a visit all on its own.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itsjustamovie
50,Touring Santa Monica and Venice,"Going to Santa Monica Pier and Venice beach, is a wonderful experience. There you can be delighted by the relaxing lifestyle in the beach, you can admire several artistic expressions like paintings, handicrafts, an appropriate diversity of food and a friendly atmosphere. You can take a walk or rent an scooter or a bike to have a tour. You will enjoy that place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mdvalenciag
50,Can’t stop visiting it!,"Brilliant place. Fantastic views, and loads of things to see . Bit overpriced, but it is a must in Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jordi-cr7
50,Sao Paolo to LA,"Great restaurants, lots of fun, and the ferris wheel rocks! This is a place to bring the family or just go on a date. There are boardwalk entertainers and you're just 10 minute walk from Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bigglilman
40,"A good Pier, an OK beach - Not worth it in January.","The Beach was just OK and not that fun. The sand is sticky and sticks on your feet. The water is also not that great. Overall, not worth going in January, too windy and chilly. The rides on the pier seemed like fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/polarbear559
40,Tips from a LOCAL for Santa Monica,"you can enjoy Santa Monica and avoid the crowds (unless PEEK summer). Best thing to do is wake up early. IF you want a view without the crazy crowds, drive further down Ocean heading North and park, walking along the bluffs. There is metered parking AND FREE parking on the residential streets NORTH of Montana. Also, you can take one of the pedestrian walks from there, over PCH down to the beach.Getting to the PIER first thing when it opens is the best time. Riding the ferris wheel offers a splendid view. Muscle beach is a fun place for all to play and it is free if you want to avoid the pier. It is on the beach directly south of the pier. Annenberg beach house also can be accessed via the pedestrian overpass and you can make a pool reservation, having access to one of Hollywoods legendary houses (former home of Marian Davies) a pool, the ocean, and a place to eat. This place is fun for all ages from toddler to great-grandparent. Parking at the house is limited so if you can walk, take the pedestrian over-pass. Right next to the PIER are two fairly inexpensive and local family spots. Bruno's Italian restaurant and the walk-through Hot Dog on a stick.For those wanting a work out and possible glimpse of some movie-stars, make your way to the Santa Monica Stairs off of Santa Monica canyon. Get your stair-climbing work out in with one of the best views, and then walk to the ocean to cool off or catch a game of volleyball.Finally, cheap eats around the area are not always easy but here are some locals enjoy:Bruno's, Gilbert's El Indio, Cha Cha Chicken, Rae's for breakfast, Bay Cities, Taco's Por Favor, Frito Misto, True Food, Shaka Shack, Ninjin Ramen, Rize Thai and Sushi, Wexler's Deli...Joe's PizzaIf you have a car, driving north to Malibu area is also fun, stopping at the Ahmanson House or the Malibu tide-pools. A trek up through one of the canyons can offer pretty hiking and a hint of local culture. Topanga canyon has Topanga Canyon state park, Hidden Treasures thrift shop for an eye-popping picture, and some hippy good time shopping options. If you hike in the canyon, try to make your way to Eagle rock. Again, getting to the parks early is key to avoiding the crowds.For those wanting less of a strenuous hike head towards",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sinipah
40,Busy!,"Boy, was this place busy!We did a walk the full length of the pier, took in the views, ate funnel cake / ice cream and watched some of the street acts.It is great to say that you have been on SM pier - it has featured in so many TV shows & movies, but we were there for just under 2hrs (including sit down funnel cake eating time!), which is plenty long enough unless you want to go on the rides (we didn't - we'd been to 6Flags and were 'coastered out!).Worth a visit? Yes, absolutely. Would i go back? Probably not, it's very, very touristy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardN28
40,Enjoyable stroll,We had a pleasant stroll along the pier and enjoyed a seat at the end to watch the ocean and it’s waves for a while. Quite relaxing. Great views back across the beach at Santa Monica. There were a few places to eat and drink if wanted. A separate part of the pier houses the funfair.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobDavis12
30,Touristy and Crowded,Walking to the end of the pier is nice for a good view of the beach. Some of the local entertainers are good. Just a heck of a lot of people and parking stinks. It is LA so you can drive 3 miles in 45 minutes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveloften028
50,Very touristic place but really nice,"Of course, it is very touristic place with many people but nice walk and Luna Park is enjoyable with perfect views from the wheel and other attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julialux347
50,Sun and Ice Cream,The Santa Monica Peir was a wonderful way to soak up some January California Sun. Since there was no chair rentals on the beach the Peir was the next best thing. I was ableto enjoy the entertainment on the Peir and have a great hand dipped ice cream.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/213stacym
50,California Fun in the Sun,"My family and I loved this place. There is a feel here that is unique to California with the beautiful Pacific Ocean all around, the beach and beachgoers surfing, swimming, and tanning in the background, and all the sights and smells of an amusement park on an ocean pier. Great place to just walk through, take pictures, people-watch, souvenir shop, and grab a snack.Although it gets crowded, it is large enough to accommodate everyone, and it's a place where you can't help but to feel a sense of fun. Just being here, you get a sense of what attracts so many people to the west coast as you scan the surroundings and see the beautiful Pacific Coast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Avenjur
50,Memories galore HIGH prices!,"Way cool to visit,lots of local talent shows to see. Games for kids,rides, plenty of food stops(pricy). Great views of everything! A must stop place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/onehotdj

40,Girls’ weekend,"What a FUN place to go on a winter evening!!! My girlfriend and I strolled to the end of the pier and read the fascinating history, then watched some of the buskers performing their crafts (the magician who pulls money out of a lemon was awesome!!), and then went on the Ferris wheel!!!!

50,Amazing place to explore!!,"Plenty to do at the pier and near the pier, if your touring the area no brainer to stop. We drove from Anaheim to the pier, depending on traffic expect to take 1.5-2.5 hours, we unfortunately fell into the more rush hours. But once your there, plenty of parking up from the pier by the mall, five minute walk, near the beach or on the pier. The mall up from the pier is huge with lots of interesting stores. Lots going on on and around the pier! Plenty of places to eat, shop, and find entertainment. Lots of performers and street type of food besides, burger, fish and chip, and a nice place at the end of the pier. The beach on a Tuesday wasn’t all that crowded, found a nice place to set up to play in the water.One note up from the pier a must stop if you like fries, The Great American Fries Co. trailer, simple and darn good fries. They have a few choices and lots of amazing dipping sauces. But the basic fries are hand cut potatoes and salt, that’s it, really good!You can spend 3-4 hours near the pier easy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wanderer0213
50,Great time,"Went on a Saturday night so we knew what we were getting in to. Extremely crowded but ride lines were reasonable. There were about 10 of them. You should purchase the ""all rides"" ticket. It's the most economical way to go. Plus the rides are excellent. The kids wanted to do several rides, several times. That Ferris wheel is the real deal. Park under the pier. Parking on the streets near impossible. Like I said we went on a Saturday night. There's a nice little aquarium under the pier worth visiting. The Word Famous Venice Beach Boardwalk about a half mile down the beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Judpma012

20,Seen better days,"My kid's were excited to go so I took them there on our first stop from LAX. My husband and I used to live in LA and never bothered to go as it was a tourist spot, too busy with Rock n Roll on Sunset Strip but I digress. They were so excited and it was nice and quiet as it was Thursday morning. The Sun was shining and a slight breeze and we were off to the end of the pier stopping to see the different venders selling their over priced wears and the entertainers singing off key and slagging off the bums who were also begging for money. the arcade got $20 out of me and that was worth it for the smiles on the kids faces but there were flies everywhere.... GROSS. The rides were extortionate prices so my 2 girls got to choose 1 ride . They'd make buckets more dollars if they gave a better deal on the rides . Glad we did it just to say we did it but had just as much fun swinging on the free swings on the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaytraditionsjax

50,Super Santa Monica!,This attraction is by far one of the best place you can go in SoCal for free! Watching a Sunset here is incredible! Walking the pier on the wooden planks takes you back in time! This is a true winner!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miamor13
50,Bucket List Item,I have always wanted to travel to LA and check out as many tourist trap spots that I could handle. Santa Monica Pier was on my list. I stayed in the area and would walk down the pier almost daily. It was tourist heaven. It was great people watching too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ogtrans2019
30,The walk over is nice for the view!,"They have a pedestrian bridge over to the pier- it’s a hill so part of the walk will be uphill!

50,Beautiful with lots to do.,"We arrived one hour before sunset.Lots of entertainers on the pier, an amusement park with a beautiful ferris wheel and carousel. Vendors, etc. We went down on the beach to watch the sun go down. The air and sand were cool and the water was ice cold. But winter is a great time to come, not so hot.

40,Pleasant,"We hurried down to the pier to catch the sunset, which we missed. So we spent a little while walking the pier and the beach. Both are lovely. There were some very talented street performers. A handful of rides and shops, and plenty of chain restaurants to eat at. There was a band playing, and at the end of the pier a spot to take pictures with the ocean.

40,"Simple, visit for the view","The pier is beautiful and it is worth the visit for a great shots. The pictures turned out amazing, and we had a nice time there, despite the cold wind. There is kpt much to see or do during winter, some of the stores and restaurants were actually closed.

30,nothing special - if you're from a coastal area,"Living in New Jersey, I've been to a lot of beaches and boardwalks. To me, this was nothing special. In my entire trip to LA this was the one place where I felt unsafe, like I had to hold my bag and my phone a little tighter. Other than that, plenty of places to eat and drink, rides and games for the kids. The end of the pier is great for fishing. Definitely don't need a whole day for it.

50,"Beautiful, but busy","We ended up here from January 1-3 and it was fantastic. It was a little cool by the pier because of the ocean winds. Very busy even with the cool breeze. Plenty of places to eat or you can walk away from the pier across the street for more options. Walked off the pier and walked on the sand, water is very cold. Great place for pictures and to see some of the coastline. Overall a great day here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GREENLANTURN
20,A bit disappointing,We visited Santa Monica Pier and boulevard but to be honest I have no idea what the hype is over. We stayed at Redondo beach and pier and it was so much quieter with fresh seafood markets.My advice is if you don’t have the time don’t waste it coming to a mini carnival on the beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShazChris
40,Great sunset and place to walk,"Just a couple of miles from Venice this place is very nice looking and has a great vibe whitin.Sunset here is amazing and you can get some nice fair food on the pier.

Nice place to walk and enjoy the beach area. if you are someone who enjoys rides there is a Ferris wheel overlooking the ocean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharmainD_12
30,Underwhelming and unremarkable,Schlepped all the way from LAX as had a stopover and wouldn't rush back. The pier is fine but there really is nothing special to warrant going out of your way to get here. If you are in the area then makes sense but that's about all the effort I would apply to see this spot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adamw744

30,Overcrowded,We took forever to find a parking lot and only to stay there for a short while. The place was way too crowded (not sure if it's because of the Thanksgiving weekend).We didn't get to soak in the atmosphere for sure. We came in the evening this time and hope to visit it at another time of the day in future.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NoinahJaeb
20,So overcrowded it was hard to walk,This probably is nice but it was so extremely overcrowded we ended up not doing anything except one carnival game and getting some custard. I was literally afraid to let my children (7 & 9) out of my sight for even a minute because it would have been nearly impossible to ever find them again. The bathrooms were clean and nice for changing from the beach. I would suggest going early and leaving as soon as it’s dark.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maegan2450
40,Crowded place but fun to visit - day and night,"Visited the Santa Monica Pier with the family a couple of times while on vacation and staying in Santa Monica. We enjoyed stopping by there, both during the day and with all the lights at night, but it is both crowded and loud so we did not stay long.The Santa Monica Pier is quite large and provides a selection of restaurants/bars, shops and an amusement park. It is popular and can get very crowded and busy, with lots of visitors mixed with people putting on shows, people fishing and more. It could get overwhelming with the kids, but when able to find a slightly quieter areas, it isfun to see all the people and enjoy the beach sights by day and the lights by night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EagleFlyer

40,nice at night,"There aren't as many different places to eat on the pier as I would have thought but what we did eat was good. Lots of vendors doing the same thing, more variety is needed. Police presence is evident which is nice. Parking is a bit of a nightmare but that is a theme to Santa Monica in total.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hotmamma2008
30,"nice beach, very crowded with lots of cars","The beach and sunset are very nice, but since everybody would want to park directly on the beach if it would be possible, it is full of cars lined up until where the beach starts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel_Squad_RO
50,Iconic Spot for local food and beautiful views,"We had a beautiful December day to visit. We went in the morning and had lunch before we left. It was the perfect time to go as the crowd started arriving around 11. If you have a warmer day I highly suggest going early. Carousel, Ferris Wheel and most eateries open at 11:00. You must stop in and see the carousel. It's simply beautiful. There is an area where you can watch trapeze artists, but none were there when we were. If you're in the area, it's definitely worth a visit. You can feel the nostalgia as you walk down the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/respectthespoon

I only had several hours on one evening to stop by and view a sunset, then walk the pier, but oh how I long to go back! It felt like a dream that was cut too short! Living all the way over in Michigan makes it hard to revisit (time and expense wise), but GO, just GO visit the Santa Monica Pier. You will NOT be disappointed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/informer51
50,Exactly how I imagined it would be,"The pier was a bustling placeThe smell of food cooking people everywhere, rides, sideshow, the beach. It was fantastic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A9392GYkimw
50,Brisk cool ocean air...,"Parking as always is the problem, less so in January, but we are not in a movie where there seems always to be an open space right in front and nobody ever ever has to parallel park. Never have been on any of the rides, just a people watching stroll to the end of the pier and back. A great walk, how can LA people seem so foreign to we from Orange County? Always something to be amazed at here, not in a bad manner, just different from our own walks on the local piers. Dusk has turned into nighttime darkness, the bright lights come and go. The Ferris Wheel turns, if it we a bit warmer I would be tempted to buy a ticket for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/citronjimmerz

Toilets and restaurant on the pier and mini theme park for the kids,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shellutd
30,Typical amusement arcades with various stalls.,"This is a typical tourist trap that one visits once in a life time. During the day time it is worth a walk and in the evening most stalls start to close around 7.30/8.00. Not romantic nor fun really, just a simple cheap amusement area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pavakeal

30,"Fun Place to Check Out, but Hot and Crowded","We stopped here on our way to LA, and we had been in the car for a long time, so I'll preface my review with that fact. It was absolutley iconic. Fun to say I've been to - check out the end of route 66. But overall it was expensive, crowded and hot. Parking was expensive. Our 2 kids (ages 7 and 9) wanted to ride rides but they were so pricey, so we didn't do too much here. Probably not worth it if trying to save some money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TracyMcMo

50,Stroll on the Pier,It is a little like stepping back in time which makes the pier experience quaint. We are staying in Santa Monica so going to the pier is easy. There always seems to be a lot of people day and night strolling the pier so obviously a popular tourist destination for LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janettec884

40,Slightly too crowded but quaint,"It’s definitely a ‘must-see’ spot but after a walk down the pier and a little window shopping, just head down to the beach and enjoy a quieter walk along the water. We didn’t visit the amusement park there but it looked like fun. Bring a blanket so you can sit at the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gitanjalis2016

40,Fun at the pier.,"Celebrating our 30th Wedding Anniversary at the Santa Monica Le Merigot, walked and biked to the pier numerous times.The pier was tide and very secure with Police presence there.We rode the Ferris Wheel for $10.00 per person and was worth every cent.We were also entertained by the singing group Noelles who spread holiday cheer.The are numerous place to dine.

Yum.Ya, just like everywhere else, you see homeless people but they don't bother anyone.anyone.Definitely a fun time for the entire family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LVLAMBO
30,Not as in the movies,"We headed to the pier early in the morning to avoid crowds.. and yes, not too many people around.. and all the shops etc were closed.. only some opens. Not really as in the movies. Worth visiting to be able to tick off this from your bucketlist.. but no need to go a second time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/360sofiam
50,One of my fav spots in LA,"If you are in town the pier of a must go, enjoying the sun, seeing the sunset or visiting at night. If you visit during day you need to walk beach side so you can feel the incredible weather that the spot offers",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/355octavioo
40,Well worth a visit,Visited as a stop on our hop on hop off bus tour. Hundreds of people but no one was pushy. Could be a total money pit for sure. We went on one ride each which was $50.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sherbsfamily
50,Your Happy Place in California Santa Monica Pier,"A must for anyone who is coming to California. The Santa Monica Pier is the place to see. It is probably the most famous pier in the World. When you come, bring the kids, because it is full of games and rides. Don't miss the street entertainers on the pier either. If you are lucky, at the end of the pier is usually a seal in the water looking for a hand out. Plenty of food to buy, artists, and souvenirs as well. Local hotels across the street from the beach too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MartinPVernon

50,Pleasant experience,"Really cool place, had so much fun! Spent 3+ hours wandering up and down the pier playing at the arcade, watching all the performers, eating good food! Very relaxed atmosphere, would love to visit again in summer as our visit was winter. Weather was still very nice!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellenmcg7

30,A typical tourist spot,"Been there with a local colleague and wasn't impressed, a typical tourist spot. Maybe on summer with kids and family it can be more fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nasuella
40,Great family atmosphere but...,"We were vising from out of state. The pier was fantastic, a lot to do with the family. The rides were expensive, but we were in California so thats probably the ""normal"" prices for things like that. My only issue with the whole experience was there were SO many religious people screaming into microphones that it was kind of distracting. There was someone preaching every 20-30 yards. It was overwhelming. It was a great time, got some great pictures, I just wish there were not so many people reminding us that we are sinners and that we are probably going to to hell.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hollywood_Help
30,tourist spot,"coming from a local, this is a touristy spot. cool to see once but nothing out of the ordinary. it is like a carnival. the free pier concerts in the summer is where it is at!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BRRTS19

Get there early in the day. Enjoyed all the outdoor entertainers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/601evansb
50,The iconic Pier with the Ferris Wheel,"The Santa Monica Pier, together with the Ferris Wheel, is undoubtedly one of Los Angeles's iconic sights. There are a lot of amusement games in the pier and of course shops and restaurants. You can even find here the finish mark of the historic Route 66, after 2,448 miles... Here too, I first met the great writer and singer Janis Ian at a summer concert!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gonen2014
50,ARCADE at SM Pier,"Had a fun time at the arcade, my friends kids loved it. We where there about a hour playing games. Lots of tourist, looky louves, Happy place on the pier for kids playing games. Met one of the owners, very interesting lady, lots of stories about the pier and Santa Monica.

50,Lovely visit,I ventured here early in the morning before too many people were out and about. Vendors were just setting up allowing me to enjoy a casual and quiet morning walking the pier and boardwalk. Gorgeous!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cdog612
30,Once is enough,"This might be a thing for folks with kids or who have seen everything else. I thought it would be more fun, and maybe it is if you know what the fun things to do are. Or maybe our timing was off, given it was a Thursday afternoon in December. Kind of noisy and maybe I was just not in the mood for that. I preferred our quieter walk on the Hermosa Beach pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LunieSt_Paul_MN
30,Holiday,Went to Santa Monica Pier yesterday on a bus trip. As a tourist it’s something that if you are in LA then you go to. Once you go there you can check off your list as it’s not something you will do again. There is mostly fast food outlets and stalls with a couple of rides. It was ok but from all the hype surrounding it we expected something a lot different. Now we have been it’s not somewhere we will go again to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/korbin5
50,Ferris wheel and wharf fun,An LA signature wharf with amusement park and plenty of restaurants and shops. Nice way to end a Walk on a long Venice beach.Famous for its concerts and festivals.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/viktoriyak912
10,Very disappointed,"Santa Monica has been on my list of places to visit for a long time. We arrived on an overcast morning at around 11:30am. The pier itself needs a lot of maintenance. It is very tired looking. There was lots of homeless people around, which can’t be helped but they were approaching us in an intimidating manner begging for money. We walked down the steps from the pier onto the beach. Despite all of the ugly brown bins lining the beach there is litter everywhere. There is lots of homeless people sleeping on the beach. We saw a man living under one of the lifeguard huts, we watched him inject himself with drugs. We decided we had seen enough within 30 minutes of being there and left in a taxi. We waited for a taxi on the ocean front walk where many homeless people have set up tents to live. Very disappointed. There was no police presence at all and felt extremely unsafe. I’m not sure how people go to Santa Monica and say it is a beautiful place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sausagedog97
50,Fantastic pier,"Great pier to visit. Lots going on for all ages. Rides, food, games, people watching, Mexican restaurant at the end of pier. Musicians playing and a perfect sunset at the end of the day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nomad5522
20,Kind of a let down...,I was excited to see Santa Monica Pier and Venice Beach but they both sort of let me down. I understood going there that the spots were very commercial and circusy but it was worse than I had imagined and there wasn’t much going on at all. The metro takes forever to get out there as well. One plus is the Mexican restaurant at the end of the Pier which is super yummy with great service,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/98madeleine98
40,A Fun Place for Kids,"Went here with my husband the week of Thanksgiving, it was still very busy despite being cold. My husband visited as a kid and wanted to show me where he'd been. While we still enjoyed our visit there wasn't a lot for adults to do. Regardless, we still had a great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pbrxmexasap
50,Cool place to hang out,"It was a great family visit to the Pacific Park, the Pier and the end point of Route 66 at the West Coast. Beautiful lit up at night and the kids love the whole experience and atmosphere!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiansingw
50,Don't miss the pier,Great place to hang out. Lots of fun for the whole family. Lots of food choices. The rides are old but cool,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wjsdunning
50,Basking in sunset’s glow,"After a grand stroll from Venice we arrived here in good time for the famous sunset. Delighted with Pacific Park we indulged in a roller-coaster ride, sufficiently before dinnertime for max thrills.Very popular with visitors and locals, it was great making our way to pier’s end at the top level. Entertainment was provided by a folk singer and his audience were very appreciative.The sunset didn’t disappoint, ending in a fiery glow over the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
50,Great early morning,"Walk or run early morning before all the crowds hit.it's amazing, you won't be disappointed.Walk along the promenade and grab some food or a drink, take photos and take in the atmosphere, it gets very busy. come early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kelly19182016
50,so entertaining !!,"lovely place, my fav in LA. close to Expo Line Metro.cool musicians, tasty restaurants, beautiful views of the pacific ocean, fun attractions at Pacific Park right next to the pier, souvenir shops as well. would spent hours and hours there !!would recommend you to go to 3rd st promenade afterwards :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacqquel
50,Lots to see,"Loved the pier street entertainers, break dancers especially, good place to buy a key ring to remember your trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Teamderby
50,Beautiful Attraction!!!!,Beautiful attraction at Santa Monica Pier!! You can walk the beach or the pier and the view of Pacific Ocean is breathtaking!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaymM2389OL
40,Relaxing walp,"Nice walk through the peir. Excellent view of the ocean. Many small souvenir shops, restaurants. 10$ parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MottiS15
50,Best view so far in L.A,Visiting Santa Monica Pier was real candy for my eyes. The view is amazing and I would say that it's even better if you go with your family or love. Charge your battery because there's many nice spots for photos.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emanuellandell
40,Funnnnnnnn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I loved it, you should definetly go.I went with my friends and we had a great time. And the rides were very fun. Kinda crowded tho.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nonofyourbusy-ness
40,Beautiful Pacific Ocean views in the midst of the iconic Santa Monica Pier,"We spent an afternoon here, first checked out the amusement park on the pier (great for kids), then did a little retail therapy a few blocks from the pier on 3rd (good mix of stores), then we rounded off the day by taking in the sunset on the pier. Loved how pretty it looked once the amusement park lights were on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/niavm2017
40,Good Afternoon Trip,"We came here in the afternoon so I think we missed out on some of the carnival vibe that some of the other comments seem to mention. It was a cool place to visit with a variety of shops for food and merchandise. It's got a pretty nice view once you reach the end of the pier. I imagine this would be funner in the evening once all the rides are up and running and it'd be more appropriate for a few drinks at that point as well. It has pretty easy access to the beach as well to just kick back and enjoy the Ocean.The only cons were that there were several people who were going up and down the pier using aggressive tactics to sell things they had on them. In addition to that, there are lots of homeless in the area, most of which I'm sure are harmless but it can make you feel a little uneasy when you're at quieter, more remote part of the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RSzklarz
40,"Something for everyone, Seaside","The Santa Monica pier is a great place to be seaside for the family. There is something for everyone. We arrived at about 10 am. At 11:00 am, We enjoyed the Buba Gump restaurant for an early lunch. Early lunch is recommended if you have a larger group. After lunch we went to the beach. You should remember to bring blankets to enjoy a rest. To finish the day we went to the Starbucks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spiritwheels
50,Nice Place Nice Food,Waoooooo Excellent food and restaurant. Its very windy some time but its worth go for eating seafood there . Any seafood restaurant is good . Enjoy it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/659felixv
30,Carnival atmosphere,"Even during the day, the pier boasts a typical carnival atmosphere, with large crowds and many barkers advertising items that are rarely found elsewhere. Parking can be expensive. We parked at a meter for $2.25/hour, but the meters only take quarters, so one must prepare in advance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1Wisetraveller
50,Beautiful Sunset!!,We stayed in Santa Monica for four days and were able to visit the Santa Monica Pier both in the morning and evening during the sunset. Coming from the east coast it was awesome to see the sunset over the ocean which we don't get back home. We also rented bikes one morning and rode the bike trail from Santa Monica pier to Venice Beach (Muscle Beach) which was very fun and scenic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/935ronaldm
40,Pure Nostalgia,"This pier has a rich history. It's actually featured in a vert well-known, transformational book entitled ""Five People You Meet On The Way To Heaven"" (I strongly recommend that read). However, this mini-amusement park is not what it used to be. It can get very over-crowded and the prices are exorbitant. The best way to do it is to look for specials on Groupon or other like sites.I will say it's one of the most nostalgia-inspiring places in Los Angeles and for that it's worth the time and money spent. But not on the regular. I most recommend the dragon and roller coaster, two of the most fun rides. The arcade can be fun for kids as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Climber550204
50,Amazingly cool,"If you seen in films you must go, just be aware that to english people it is an upmarket blackpool but well worth the experience and the views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamiebranson
50,Amazing Atmosphere,Spent an evening here during the LA trip. It is a wonderful place to just sit and watch the water. Some wonderful food options in the neighborhood and on the pier. The Pacific Park was closed at the time we reached to the Pier otherwise it would have been lovely to check that out as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AkshayaS1978
40,Nice place to spend the weekend mainly at sunday at LA,"I was there 3 weeks ago, walking and eating is a nice place several people, I prefer the morning if you go there , in the afternoon is crowded. Viajo sequido a California por un hijo que estudia alla y vamos a esta parte de los Angeles, muy agradable pero de preferencia en la mañana,,,,,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnCM263
50,A must see!,"You must experience the Santa Monica Pier if you’re visiting CA! It has such a great vibe, with lots of little shops, stalls and food on offer.We went early in the morning when it was quieter, which meant it was easy to wander as not as much is open. We loved the pier so much we came back to watch the sun set!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Just_Been_Travelling
50,Mini Vacation,"stayed in Marina Del Ray and before leaving for Santa Barbara stopped by the Santa Monica Pier and what a collection of different attractions, from rides to restaurants to flying trapeze that from the looks of things anyone can try out, there's something there for everyone to enjoy and you can drive right onto the pier and park there , a must see if you're there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jwnowak
30,Tacky and Touristy,Its Tacky and Touristy but a well know landmark in LA so its worth a visit if you have time. Plenty of food options but not cheap,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Crusader007
40,Iconic place to visit,"We went to have lunch and it was great. Nice views, many dining options. Theres is also a wheel of fortune and plenty of other activities to enjoy. You have to walk your way in and out, across a bridge..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F5930AXclaudiac
50,So much fun to be had with gorgeous views!,We spent a beautiful sunny day at the pier and made so many memories! We bought the unlimited ride bracelets which was well worth the money! We went right before the park opened and had a little snack and took in the views. We stayed for a few hours and then left to explore Santa Monica for a bit. We returned that night when it was all lit up and rode the rides again. I highly recommend getting the unlimited pass!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KeriLaura
20,Iconic Yes. Clean No.,"Cool place to visit. A piece of American history for sure. Amazing beach and great scenery. Easy access, a few interesting shops and restaurants. Unfortunately the area is not well kept or clean.Still worth the stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marsands2016
30,Sadly Expected More ....,"On an overcast day we pitched up here for a walk and although part of the vibe of Santa Monica the aged pier was full of Burger , Hot Dog & Cheap EateriesThe walk along the pier was sad as it looks tired and along by Bubba Gump there were lots of homeless people begging and tourists seemed perturbed by this but sadly it's the life for some people but not great for first impressionsWhat is needed is some new infrastructure in this venue to give it a faceliftSadly dissapointed ......",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulsF1068UB
30,Brighton in California,"Santa Monica Beach is a popular destination plus there is a huge pier. The pier is full of things to spend money on like a big wheel, merry go round, fast food, bars, souvenirs, tat. On the day we were there at the entrance there were people busking. The atmosphere was fun. Not for me as it was both lively and noisy but I could see young people were really enjoying themselves. A good place for a dull afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catherinemL8442JB
50,FIRST TIME IN DECADES,"I took some friends to the pier and although I previously lived in California I never really hung out at the pier. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to get in and out, and the restaurants were all open and had decent food. The little amusement park was nice as well. I even got on that two seat ride that you control and flips you all around. I had a ball to say the least and my friends had more fun than me. A definite place to just visit for awhile if you've never been. Checked!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/livingstont
50,A cool place to visit,Santa Monica Pier is a nice location to enjoy the sea and sun. very entertaining. The Mariasol Restaurant is worth a stop for Mexican style Food.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K2773WArogerb
50,"THE PIER WHERE MAGIC HAPPENS – FAMOUS, VIBRANT, FUN!","I'm pretty sure that everybody has heard of (or will hear about) the famous Santa Monica Pier. It's often seen in your favourite films or TV shows with its colourful roller-coaster and vibrant atmosphere.We visited during our vacation to Santa Monica and we absolutely loved it, we simply couldn't get enough.It has a theme park (Pacific Park - which is great fun for adults and kids of all ages), tonnes of restaurants where you can grab a bite to eat (with amazing surroundings) or perhaps a drink or two (or three!) If you're lucky you can even catch some fisherman reeling in their rods from the end of the pier. Whilst we were there we managed to witness something being filmed which was quite an experience (unfortunately we didn't see any famous people though).If you're looking for somewhere to eat we would highly recommend Bubba Gumps (famous for featuring in the film 'Forrest Gump') or Seaside on the Pier which has an outdoor balcony level that gives you amazing views of Santa Monica Beach and has the most delicious Pina Coladas around, the food is also super tasty (albeit a little expensive).The vibe on Santa Monica Pier is like no other. You will see the weird, the wonderful, the young, the old – there is something for everyone and I have never heard of a bad experience by any of my friends that have visited. There is so much to do and see, even if you're not looking to spend any dollar you can simply sit on the edge of the pier and people watch (which is an experience in itself).Overall we had a fab day out at Santa Monica Pier and we cannot wait for our next visit!Instagram: @journeywithuss",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/journeywithuss
30,Must see but better parts of Santa Monica,"As a resident of Santa Monica, there is a bit of nostalgia about the Pier. But like most amusement piers, the Santa Monica Pier is a must see for visitors, but beyond that, it isn’t the best part of Santa Monica. Check it out and then move along to the Santa Monica-Venice esplanade, 3rd Street Promenade, Ocean Ave, or Main Street. It’s historic and has a rich history (especially being the end of historic Route 66).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carsonjfbruno
50,Great perspective,"People in Santa Monica pay massive dollars to live there. And their taxes are through the roof. The beach water is full of human poop when it rains. It just makes me feel so very good about my life choices. Thank you, so much, Santa Monica for the perspective. Also, my brother lives here. Knowing his entitled butt lives with human excrement in the water really levels the playing field for us. I feel like it's made me a better person. Best part, you don't know the water is full of human poop until someone tells you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meganaG679SS
20,famous pier,nothing special! lots of people for me was too crowded ! i would say not worth to spend a lot of time! although there are some restaurants ( i didn’t tried them) but it is the famous Forest Gum Bubba one!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/270albinaz
40,What you would think,"Very crowed. Have to pay for parking. You can park close to the beach, near the sand. The food lines go fast. The arcade games and rollercoaster type rides are nice. Nicer than Venice Beach. Would go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelLadySydney
40,Must visit landmark in L.A.,"Our family had a great time visiting the Santa Monica pier. It felt like we were visiting an open air museum. From the wood the pier is built on, the classic carrousel in the entrance to the fun amusement park reminiscent of Coney Island.Many carnival type food options as well as mid scale restaurants are available.If you go to the amusement park, the best option is to buy the multi ride band. It pays itself with only 3 rides.The views from the Ferris Wheel are breathtaking. My photo does not do it justice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnassisDuron
50,Beach time,Santa Monica Pier is a great place for family to enjoy the sand and water. We encountered a dolphin and her baby swim close to shore. Amazing place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/diegorC279SK
30,Nice walk and people watching,"Easy walk and stroll on the Piers. Great scenery of the Pacific with the coast goes as far as the eyes can see. There is an amusement park, a few restaurants, and a gift shop. Many stalls setup along the boardwalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TriStupe
50,Sunset,"The beach and the pier have a good environment and you see anything from magic shows on the pier to people selling holographic shirts.Take a look at the sunset over the pier, because the view it’s something remarkable and I don’t think you can see that kind of sunsets easily on other places.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sachi1612
10,I don’t get what’s the point of this place,It’s a waste of time I feel like. Nothing really to see really. The stuff there are old and they don’t even spend money to upgrade what they have.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oliverl0425
50,Must not miss experience,"Spend an entire day at SM pier and the shopping areas nearby. Great place to just walk around and take in a big piece of history (Route 66) and spectacular view of the pacific coast.Park in the mall, grab a bite on 3rd street promenade and burn off that meal while walking to the pier. So much to do or even just ppl watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kkuizon
10,Huge disappointment,"It is dirty, small, full of beggars and tourist rips off. The rides suck and are incredibly expensive. Don't waste your time. Venice Broadwell is way nicer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lutitlu
30,For the younger crowd.... grown ups not so much!,Went here many times as a kid. Great carnival type feel on a pier on the beach.Best attraction is the ferris wheel. Parking is great and easy to find off Pacific Coast Highway.Great for kids!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lentara71
40,A Must Do,"From the restaurants to the shops to just the view...the pier is a must do anytime I’m in LA for work. Next time, I’ll hit the roller coaster too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ecbronze
40,Nice place to see the sunset,"This is a very touristic place but worth a visit. You have seen it plenty of times in the movies and tv shows. The pier has good options for a meal - although just across the street you may find more upscale restaurants - entertaining and souvenir shops. The all famous Route 66 ends right there. As for me the main reason to go there is to appreciate the sunset on a clear afternoon. Find your spot, grab a drink and relax enjoying the sunset by the ocean. A couple of blocks away, on 2nd and 3rd St, you have a shopping area with good stores and restaurants. I had only one afternoon in LA and went from LAX to the Pier using public transportation - free shuttle from airport terminal to City Bus Center then Big Blue Bus 3 for $1.25 one way . It took me c. 1 hour and was totally worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nirok560

50,Love it!,"We love Santa Monica Pier, and we visit it every time we're in LA. The atmosphere is so much fun and so many cool characters are either playing music, selling memorabilia or doing magic tricks on the pier. the Paris wheel gives you an amazing overlook of Santa Monica and sitting down at one of the pier cafes for a cup of coffee while you're there is a must. We always sit close enough to hear the street artist (pannist) who plays on a steel drum to music, and it gives the music a nice Caribbean touch, I love it. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/960carmend
40,Always find time for a visit,We love to have drink and lunch followed with a walk along the pier watch people fishing and the Sea lion when we were there could see the smoke from the fires very sad.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teejay11

30,Good for a quick visit,"Not nearly as much fun as Venice Beach unless you have young kids who want to ride the midway attractions. We paid $15 (I think) to park at a nearby hotel, then walked around for about an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gregsky
40,How many movies have been filmed here?,"Classic icon that you feel you know when you visit. Lovely location and beach view. Always something happening along the pier. You can get food, gifts from local artisans, be entertained all from the one stroll. If your feeling energetic,stroll the Venice beach boardwalk.

30,The end of route 66,"A traditional pier at Santa Monica beach, with lots of options for food, drinks and shop. Lots of street vendors as well, and the traditional amusement park. Worth the visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fernandowr10
30,Glad we went,"We drove down from Hollywood. Traffic terrible. We found parking very easy to find, Did not cost very much compared to everywhere else in LA. We spent about three hours walking the pier and see the sights. Had drink at couple of the restaurants. Was an eye opener to all the homeless people. We felt safe though, There was police presence the whole time we were there. We enjoyed our time there. worth seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/114d2018

50,Iconic Pier!,"A must-see attraction in the Los Angeles area, the Santa Monica Pier is delightful, bustling, happening and beautiful. The pier personifies the Southern California stereotype. This is the western terminus of Route 66 and also is the first concrete pier on the West Coast. There are a number of entertainment options, restaurants, souvenir shops and the Pacific Park on the pier houses a few rides including a roller coaster and a giant Ferris Wheel. We went on the Ferris Wheel, which claims to be the world's largest solar powered one. The ride is slow and is quite good to take in some wonderful photographs of the Pacific Ocean and soak in the sea breeze. I'd definitely recommend trying your hands at some of the rides in the Pacific Park, there is also an arcade game center as well on the pier.There is something for all ages here. The street artists and performers add a very absorbing, often topical angle to this attraction. Fishing seemed to be quite a popular activity here - I saw a sizable number of people dropping off fishing lines along the pier. There are a number of different restaurants serving up food and dessert here. The sunset happened when we were on the Ferris Wheel, it was indeed a gorgeous sight to see the sun go down from the top of a Ferris Wheel!The blue Pacific coastline, a beautiful pier, typical SoCal vibe and some wonderful memories is how I'll summarize the Santa Monica Pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nostalgiyeah
40,Nice place to hang and watch the people,Obvious a tourist spot on the pier but it is fun to watch the varied people as well as view both the ocean and surrounding hillsides. The beach is gorgeous as well,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryC768
50,Lots of fun,We had a blast visiting the pier. It was our first time in the area and enjoyed our time there. We will definitely stop by again if we are fortunate enough to visit this place again. We could have people watched and wildlife - seal- for hours. The entertainment along the pier varied from area to area. There was an older gentleman at the very end of the pier selling his cd's- I regret not having purchased one.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wkcb

50,Very nice place to hang out,"It’s my second time to visit this place,I visited in January 2011 and was a little bit chilly that time and last month was so nice even it was 91 degrees.few rides were added and the new one I saw was the giant Pooh!parking is available inside the pier so you don’t need to walk too far.i enjoyed the guy playing saxophone by the pier he was awesome but sad to say,he was about to finished when we got there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eloison10

40,"Nice pier, Good walk and full of interesting street performers","You just have to go here when in LA. Its Santa Monica Pier! It's the end of Route 66! It is just a must do attraction. Walk along the pier down to the end and see the wonderful street performers. We watched a magician, a street dancer and a few singers. 75% of them were fun to watch one seemed to be singing word by word for $1 a word so we kinda passed up on that.Spend some time in the shops and dont forget to visit the aquarium underneath. It's the best $5 per adult you'll spend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iwanderaroundtown
50,One of the LA areas gotta goes,"Yes, parking can be a pain and you'll spend a few dollars but the views, experience and the memories that you've been there are totally worth the effort.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlayBigX
40,End point of Route 66,It was a very lively experience with plenty to see and enjoy. The many acts on the jetty were professional and enjoyable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NorthStar03040354425
30,Must see when visiting Santa Monica,"Now we have been there in the most visited area in Santa Monica, very crowded, went there everday during our visit in Santa Monica.To be honest it is nothing special at all,,we went there only beacause we like to be close to ocean and it is a nice walk to Venice beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StockholmFamily
30,A Bit Disappointing,Generally a bit disappointing. Lots of begging going on and my other half almost had her purse lifted from her bag until the perpetrator realised at the last minute I’d seen what he was up to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/740laurenceg
50,Funny place,"Awesome, it is really good place to visit, with family, friends. In that place you can find games, food (little bit expensive, I recommend Bubba's shrimps), also at the end of the pier (near to the ocean) you can find a lot of gift (magnetics, t shirts, etc, really nice and no so expensive)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danquinb
30,Closes down too early,"Went on a Thursday evening to find the rides and restaurants closing at 9pm. Not the energy level I expected. We all regretted driving here, except to capture pics of the Route 66 sign & eat dinner at Rusty’s! Great restaurant serving delicious mahi mahi!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SesameOntario
50,Must see when visiting LA.,It's always fun to walk around Santa Monica. We love having lunch at The Lobster overlooking the pier. Valet service so parking is a breeze. Nice beach for sunbathing with beautiful views of the hills.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/245ceceliah
30,Go when the rides are open!,I went after sunset and there wasn't much going on besides tourists wandering around. I expect it would be different when the rides are open (I was told midday).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saracgrady
40,Always crowded with tourists,It is a busy place and you can easily find inexpensive parking on beaches nearby (or on streets for free). You get a great view on beaches from this pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O6378WFannag
50,Beautiful,We had dinner at the Lobster. It was very good. The sunset at this place is amazing. There's a lot to do at the Pier. Bring a sweater if you get cold easy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsBFab

30,Just OK,"Arrived to the pier from Malibu side. No problem with parking. We are not beach people, so one hour was enough for us. It is very touristy place. In the same day we visited TV series MASH site at Malibu Creek State Park, battleship Iowa in LA and NHL game at the Staples Center. All of them we found more informative and entertaining than Santa Monica Pier, sorry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thomasero
50,Great vibes,"Flew to LA and took a tour of Santa Monica beach, the boardwalk was super packed but filled with great vibes music, food, a small theme park crisp sunny weather and lots of great views especially for photography, as i walked through the pier there are people singing and playing instruments displaying their talents, vendors selling hats, shirts, balloons for kids, food and more the view from the pier of the ocean and beach was just breathtaking got to people watch and just enjoy life, as i kept walking through the beach trail off the boardwalk i ran into muscle beach which was an experience all on its own people playing music working out altogether just vibing was super cool to see i def recommend people of all ages to enjoy Santa Monica piers and beach whenever in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelwithswag

50,You have to go,"We took a side trip after a business trip to see the Pier, lots to do and see while you are there. I can understand why people think this is a tourist trap but this doesn't mean you have to spend money. Just go enough a sunset or watch the weather. One fact I didn't know is this is where Popeye was thought of.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Laker0213
40,Nice to visit as a famous landmark,"This is the iconic image of Santa Monica and the end of the historic route 66. The view is quite nice, but I found this place worth visiting more for the historic significance than the place itself. The amusement park is very small. There are a few stalls selling food, but really nothing memorable. Still worth a short visit. Also okay for people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karimmaarouf
50,As Expected,"We have always seen the pier on TV so it was a must see. Reminded us somewhat of Daytona Beach with the beautiful beach, waves, and pier of many talents and shops.

30,Very Touristy,"Yeah, I was a tourist too...but this place is a tourist trap. So many people on a Monday in October! Side attractions trying to get your money. And the cost of Pacifica Park is ridiculous. Nice to say I went there once, got great pictures, but no need to go back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MamaP73

10,Pretty grubby,"There is a huge lovely beach but the pier,though iconic was a pretty grubby place and the classic tourist trap and it successfully traps lots of them. Avoid but enjoy the amazing beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tasty1111

40,Worth a visit,"Have been here a few times and it's generally good but always busy. Local parking is expensive, street performers are usually good.

10,Why ruin a beautiful Beach,I seem to be a European snob. Why have Santa Monica been destroyed by a roller coaster nightmare! Coasts and beaches should be natural and not filled with amusement parks! That being said the Beach is clean and water is nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsMZH
50,Lunch with friends,Went to Santa Monica and ate at Del Frisco's Grille which is directly across Ocean Blvd from the Santa Monica PierGreat afternoon with friends and sightseeing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JahCruiser
50,Life’s wonderful carnival by the sea,"No trip to Southern California is complete without a day at the beach, to sun, sea and see Santa Monica. And the best porch is the one called the pier. Fishing and trolling for carnival treats while watching surfers negotiate the cresting waves is worth the greater part of the day, any day or night",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdZ879
40,Must visit area,"Visited the beach and pier at Santa Monica while on a visit to Los Angeles. The beach is amazing, long white sands and enough waves to keep you body surfing for a while. The pier is busy and full of attractions, rides and places to eat. The bar /restaurant at the end is worth a stop for a cold beer or cocktail. Plenty of parking available too",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123JessicaW
30,An interesting place,Only went here because Tripadvisor suggested it. It's ok for a date as a teenager or taking your children. Great for pictures of the ocean and sunsets. Everyone wants to sell you something and there is a handful of street people that take away from the pier,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C221DVcarlosa
50,Lovely family atmosphere,"We walked here along the boardwalk from Venice beach, lovely walk. I particularly loved the family atmosphere, lots of smiling faces. We did two rides, the wheel and the rollercoaster and enjoyed both. Fantastic views both ways from the Pier end.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZoeB762
30,Too crowded and touristic,"This is a long and spacious pier offering nice views. However, it is very popular among tourists and the service has developed accordingly; one can buy all kinds of junk here, watch street artists or overpay for mediocre food. It is still worth visiting with free entrance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeachStone2C
50,"Fun & lively place, and nice location","Great if alone, on a date, or with your family. It's very busy, in a nice bustling way. And an excellent location to get some nice photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BassemPrime

50,Exactly what I expected.,"Honestly, I loved it.It was cheesy, crowded, loud and so much fun. There are so many little street artists and performers making every corner a unique little niche. Even with the crowds it's just a fun place to visit. There isn't a lot to see and do on the pier itself, but it's in such a good area you are within walking distance of anything you could possibly want to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairytalus
10,Too much hype for this pier!!,"Visited this pier with family and didn’t feel it was made for families. The view and the artists on the pier are incredible, but it wasn’t the best! Went to the ride part- if a child doesn’t buy a wristband, the roller coaster ride was 10.00 each for a four minute ride 😳 Horrendous prices!! Found the arcade dirty, actually entire pier was dirty . Would not recommend!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blueeyedcanadian74
20,Disappointed,I have always wanted to see the pier after cruising down the highway spectacular i arrived had to pau $15 to park my motorcycle i went up to the pier it was busy but slot of kiosk were not even open it was pretty disappointing i guess my expectations were too high after seeing it on tv so often,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E9562UBcolinb

40,Pretty,I thought it was a cool place to visit. It's like a carnival on the pier which I'd beautiful at night when it's all lit up. You can see people with amazing talents and nice carnival food. I really enjoyed my visit there. The ocean view was calming.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nikkiah
30,Underwhelming,"My Husband and I visited whilst on vacation and although we went in the day so didn't see it all lit up we both felt slightly underwhelmed. There is a lot of homeless around (there's a lot where we live but this was another level) and there wasn't much to do. The pier we have back home is far better, maybe we were just expecting a bit more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foxtrot90
50,A bucket list tick,"Santa Monica Pier really is a place you go once so you can you have been there. You can see parts of it that you recognise from films, enjoy the buskers, buy a tacky souvenir and go to Bubba Gump Shrimp to immerse yourself in the culture of Forest Gump which if you are fan is pretty cool. It’s a great way to kill an hour walking hand in hand with a loved one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G169UQkirstys
50,Beautiful,"Had a beautiful time at the pier. A lot smaller than I expected, but it was a lot of fun to walk around and see everything. Views of the ocean and of nearby LA and Malibu were breath taking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ssims003
30,Visited as part of a Californian road trip,"Not sure what to expect, but we were somewhat underwhelmed when we visited the pier. It did celebrate the end of route 66 by way of souvenirs, but on the whole, the pier was mainly a row of shops and restaurants with a few fairground rides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fi55y
50,Fun.,Definitely a must see. The pier was awesome and much bigger than I thought it would be. Looks just like the movies. Wish we could have seen it at night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Neverwins
50,Magnificent place.,"Going to Santa Monica and not knowing the Pier is the same as going to Rio de Janeiro and not knowing one of its most famous beaches or Christ the Redeemer, the Santa Monica Pier is (350 Santa Monica Pier, Santa Monica, CA 90401) , it is 700 meters walk from Shopping Santa Monica Place, but I advise you to drive and leave in Pier's own parking lot, with cost, unless you enjoy walking, it is about 700 meters from each other. The Pier has a bucolic yet glamorous climate. Well known for passing in various Hollywood movies and series. It has several shops and restaurants, such as Bubba Gump, inspired by the film Forrest Gump, and Pier Burger, amusements like Pacific Park, a ferris wheel and roller coaster. It has the historical landmark that symbolizes the end of Route 66, which crosses the USA, and has a beautiful view of the beach and the Pacific Ocean, where there are always surfers. If you can, rent a bike and ride to Venice Beach, it's very close, about 2 kilometers. California, I'll be back soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hilberaldi
40,Great attraction (time it well),"So I loved the pier, the history, the vibe, the shops. I just timed it wrong. I went with mates in the morning- mid to late and it was kind of beginning to warm up. If I had chance I’d have preferred to come in the evening as I reckon it gives off an even better time.Well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GowerDG
50,Fun place to visit.,Easy walk from our Santa Monica hotel. Great place to enjoy a stroll and people watch. Some interesting free entertainment. You can eat at place on the pier and just enjoy the view and free music. Worth a quick visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dton93
50,A must see iconic tourist spot,A visit to LA area is not complete without a walk onto Santa Monica Pier. We didnt go on the big wheel but it's pretty to see lit up at night. Busy night and day and my teenagers said the donuts were particularly nice. Free to walk on and one of California's oldest amusement attractions. Fishermen still cast their lines at the end of the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaniceD884
50,Nice day,"A tourist must see, very picturesque and we have all seen it many times in the movies. I love hiring bikes and riding down to Venice or the other way. I have only been on sunny days which makes it even better, I would imagine it wouldn’t have the same impact on a rainy day. I really like the Santa Monica area it’s beautiful. We do things quick so it’s not an all day thing but you could drag it out. We started the day driving to Santa Monica pier, had a little look around then hired bikes to ride to Venice then rode back for lunch at Bubba Gump. If you do hire bikes and don’t intent on taking them back to the same shop you hired them from take note where you can drop them back, we wasted some time trying to find the return shop as 2 were closed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mo71ey
40,Iconic place,Drive down on a Friday afternoon for sunset incredibly busy great for a bit of nostalgia lots of restaurants and a good vibe (would I stay here if on hols in LA ) ? yes I guess but one night sufficient if you wanted a bit of a beach hit in the city ...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theflyingwineman
30,Family holiday to Los Angeles,Not great - A bit of a let down and prices for the individual rides are expensive. A wristband is much more cost effective if you have time.Quirky gift Shop at the end of Route 66 is nice.Sea mist bike rentals underneath near the aquarium is a good option for a great day out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helthea
40,Quiet Early Morning Stroll,Can't resist seeing the ocean when I'm nearby -- and took an early morning stroll on the beach and the pier. Delightful calm to welcome the dawn from the pier with the soothing sounds of waves below.Surprised by the number of people sleeping on the beach and on the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrightBlueStarfish
40,Good Fun,"My teenage niece really enjoyed the arcade, and with most attractions only 75 cents it was very affordable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tessa_Oz
50,Our Last Day in California,We decided to visit The famous Santa Monica Pier on our last day in California due to time constraint. Santa Monica Pier you did not disappoint. We parked our car at the shopping mall close by and simply walked down to Santa Monica Pier. There were a few bars and restaurants along the pier. You can see a few live entertainment which liven up the atmosphere. We saw the beautiful waves which hit the beach and lots of family and kids playing near the shore and basking in the sun. We stayed for sunset and had some sundowners at the restaurant. It just ended our trip in a high note. If you watched the movie ‘ The Lost Boys’ they had a scene at the pier which was deja vue for me. Definitely will be back again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nonanureen
30,Santa Monica Pier,The Pier was long and had restaurants and an amusement park and entertainers here and there. Lots of people all the time. We wanted a sit down breakfast on Friday morning and the Pier offers fast food type breakfast. We ended up going to a place on the street above the Pier that was way too spendy but oh well...we were starving and just went to the first place we saw. I have asthma so had a hard time going up the hilly part of the Pier that heads back up to the main street. All in all I'm glad we went but probably won't be going back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamieLeman
50,Fun people watching,I had a down day on a business trip so visited the beach for some much needed exercise. Stopped on the pier for a late lunch and had an enjoyable hour people watching. It was a beautiful 80 degree sunny day. Food wasn’t as overpriced as I expected.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathywF5072GK
30,Really busy boardwalk type area,"This pier would be much more enjoyable if there weren't a zillion other people also on it, it's very crowded and hard to have a casual stroll around. It's an area more meant for families, but you can do some good people watching and see some nice views. There are a lot of homeless people around this area too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avd_travel
20,"Seedy Honky-Tonk, and Oh! The Scents of Rotting Fish and B.O.","If your idea of a Fun Fair is mobs of tourists tripping over heaved boardwalk planks, and weirdos hawking scabrous souvenirs Made in China, and tasteless fast food slick with grease, and boring short-circuit carnival rides at rob-you-blind prices, then Santa Monica Pier is for you. Dirty, smelly, shabby, overpriced. Too bad the City has let this once-appealing attraction become this shameful trap for unwitting tourists. But the local vagrants love it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RThyme
50,Fun half day out,We walked around the pier and had a ride on the roller coaster which was $10 per person for two rides around the track. We didn’t eat here but enjoyed the atmosphere. There is also a lot of play and exercise equipment on the beach to use for free beside the pier. A pleasant morning activity before we walked to Venice beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myheartisinherts
50,Escape mid-week and off-season to the Beach,"Venture to the far western side of the pier for interesting music (Hawaiian ukelele and steel drums) and to see the official End of Route 66 memorabilia display. It's a calming way to spend several hours during off-season, mid-week at the beach. I loved the carousel ride and the history of the first Lifeguard team.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ckp4all
20,Fun place but needs a bath,The pier is getting a little seedy. There are a lot of sub par street performers that border on creepy. In fact the Venice Beach Street performers are a little higher quality which says a lot.The prices for the rides has gotten out of hand. They also need to coordinate the website with the calendar. The website said the rides were open til 10:00pm however they closed at 7:00pm. The pier needs a management overhaul,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingW2E
40,Santa Monica pier,Spent our last day of vacation in several spots. Santa Monica pier was very clean. There was several free entertaining shows going. There were musicians playing. Several souvenir shops for last minute gifts. Also purchased a sand stone carved by a gentleman on the pier. A great keepsake. Finished with relaxing on the beach on watching a sunset. Beautiful views all around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simmonspj
50,I love this place,"I have been to the pier several times over the years and we usually take a long roadtrip from Kansas just to get here. But when you finally make it to the coast, The long experience is well worth it. California is a beautiful state period, But the Santa Monia Pier...the atmosphere...the people...that cali love is MAGIC. I love to just stand and watch the waves crash on the shore. There is almost always something new to do or see at the Pier everytime we visit. We have seen many Musical acts, some of which are or have become quite famous, and dining is good as well. Nothing beats standing on the pier and watching the sunset. Another fun fact is that Venice Beach is a short bike ride away, you could even walk there if you wanted.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theuglytruth77
50,Final day,Stopped here before we headed home. The grand kids had a ball playing in the ocean and walking along the pier to look at the view. We took a picture in front of the Route 66 sign end of the trail. The weather was perfect and not a lot of people since we were there on a Monday. Well worth visiting if you are ever in the area,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nanaof1boy3girls
50,Beautiful Pier,It was great to finally make it to the most beautiful Pier and enjoy the views and the atmosphere. I can highly recommend it to you!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/346alexanderr
50,A must see!,"I visited this iconic location early October, on a 28-30 degree perfectly sunny Saturday (approx 82F). As such, it was very very busy! However, it was still thoroughly enjoyable to take in the sights. There are some nice restaurants/bars there, and some fun rides for the kids. The water and the view back towards the beach and mountains are both stunning. The surrounding area is lovely too, also with great cafes and restaurants. It all looks very modern and clean. Well worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TanyaB1192
40,Definitely a must to visit,This iconic pier is well worth the visit if you are in Santa Monica but it is very crowded at the weekends.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/margaretp625
50,Lovely,"What a happy, safe place with great views to visit, on pier parking was more than reasonable... certainly better than venice beach which was sadly a little more occupied by homeless",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jon8334
40,Santa Monica Pier,"Fantastic place for young families and couples, a fun park on the water with bars, restaurants, cafes, show rides and games. Great views from the Ferris wheel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brchamp70
40,Iconic,The pier is definitely worth visiting at least one time while in LA. It offers great views of the Pacific Ocean and Santa Monica. Great sunset and interesting boardwalk for people watching.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/434joannet
50,So colourful! So pretty!,"Fun place to go after downing shots at Santa Monica bars 💛 Best sunset and so many characters along the boardwalk, forever entertained!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosysetephano
40,Visited an icon,The pier itself is seen in so many movies and tv shows that the family wanted to visit. It’s ok to spend half an hour walking. The vendors products are generic and better choices are nearby in Venice beach. Park elsewhere as the pier rates can be high,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X5231AKpaulh
30,it’s a a bit seedy but it’s fun,"If one likes Blackpool or other similar British seaside attractions the its great. It has a roller coaster other rides and attractions, unhealthy, but I am sure, tasty fast food, stalks and an assortment of bus cars and pedlars. However it also has a few decent restaurants, excluding Bubba Shrimp where most of the dishes contain sufficient calories to meet a male daily requirement.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Whitefox100
40,Nice place to visit,"We went to Santa Monica Pier for the day. The pier has games, rides, souvenirs, musicians and eateries. We ate lunch at Bubba Gumps which had really nice seafood. The views from the pier are beautiful. Overall, well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Matrickana
30,Not as much to see as expexted,Didnt really live up to what you see in tv and film - quite plain and not much to see. Indoor carousel only opens part of the week so check before you go,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B251GCclaired
20,Photo op only - over crowded and over priced tourist trap,"Get the photo at sunrise, sunset or at night lights then head back to 3rd street promenade. There really isn’t much to do on the pier except watch your wallet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Neulara
40,A little of everything!,"We stayed at the Vicery which is a short walk from the pier entrance. Food, carnival like atmosphere by the ocean. Great place to see the sunset. The Lobster is a good place to sit and eat while the sunsets. Good for anyone to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/takeatripwithtipp
50,So many things to do!,"There are so many things to do here! You can enjoy the beach, Eat at a restaurant, Walk down the pier, enjoy the view, watch live performances from civilians, enjoy the fair, have some drinks... And they have a Bubba Gump ofcourse!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samanthabK5985HH
50,Everything you imagined,Fun rides. Amazing food. Great shops. Beautiful sand beach. Gorgeous views of the Pacific ocean. Walk The pier. Ride the ferris wheel. Enjoy a meal. Go fishing or swimming. It's all great!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/corianderw
50,Beautiful spot!,We were in LA for one day and chose to go here. It was a beautiful day and we spend a very pleasant couple of hours on the pier watching buskers and taking in the atmosphere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catherinemL6840DS
40,Lively,"Fun and lively, plenty of bits and pieces to buy and of course the big Ferris Wheel you can see from far and wide. Make sure you are there for sunset .....a must",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OSheaTraveller
40,Crowded and rides overpriced,We parked in a public garage that was quite reasonable. Pleasant walk along pier. Did not go on any rides as the price was too high. The performers and artists along the pier were fun to watch. Had fun on the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Curiosity198309
30,Good to see,"Visited here as part of a tour and had an hour stop which was plenty of time. Good to see it and walk the length of the pier, in particular seeing the end of Route 66 sign but other than that it’s nothing special and didn’t feel like we needed any longer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robynl1989
40,Holiday,"Walked from Venice beach, just to see the Ferris wheel from the Mitch Albom book ‘5 people you meet in heaven’. Glorious sunny day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/veggieLisa
40,Love it here,The pier is awesome and the lights as the sun go down are brilliant. This is a brilliant place to go and unwind. If you want to do the trip along the pathway to Venice do not use the electric scooters as they won’t work. Either hire an ordinary bike or walk it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidcA3695SG
50,Great place for an evening,"We enjoyed a nice walk and a light dinner on the pier. The local artists were interesting to watch, plus some musicians proved to be entertaining. Plenty of souvenirs if you are nostalgic for Route 66. Simply a unique experience. There is a small amusement park for further fun. Plus they offer public restrooms and beach access.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U9368YZandrewb
30,More Touristy Than I Expected,The Peir is super touristy so go if you are in to that. It is a bit directly like most busy piers tend to be. You can access the beach from the pier and it is a pretty beach and wasn’t too busy when I was there on a sunny day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmktravelsalot
50,On the pier,"Had a great time here good atmosphere, with live music and small stalls. The food outlets were nice. And a vintage merry go round at the very start of the pier. And importantly to people who have travelled on Route 66 like myself. The finishing sign on the pier. Really enjoyed the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crow58
40,Beautiful,"This is a must see if in town. Beautiful old pier that you can walk along with places to eat, drink and buy your souvenirs. Visit the sign that marks the end of the famous Route 66 and there is a cool little store with plenty of little thing to buy to mark it and check out all the different currency's stuck to the walls from visitors. If you walk to the end look for the seal who gets fed by the people fishing of the end. View of the beach from here is also great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gunghogaz
50,Nice contrast to LA down town,"Like it it’s living, pulsing and colorful! Nice beach and ample parking. Lots of fine idea as well for kids!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flipflop525
50,The Western Terminus of Route 66 kept me coming back.,"The pier is a great place to walk, morning, afternoon, or evening.Some businesses are not open on all days. I was there Tuesday and Wednesday, unfortunately the Hippodrome is not open those two days.There is a lot to see, or sea. The aquarium is right next to the indoor carousel. There are many shops and cart vendors to peruse. Restaurants to try, including Bubba Gump Shrimp, Marisol's, Rusty's, and many more. There are artists and musicians to experience, sunshine, the sound of waves, happy people, and a nice breeze.I had several plans while I was in Santa Monica but I kept coming back to the pier instead. As I was leaving they were setting up for a live performance.There is just something about it...check it out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deborah_SKK
40,Fun Area to Spend Part of a Day,"The Santa Monica Pier is a fun area to spend part of the day. There is plenty to see and do on the pier for all ages. One may fish off the pier, dine in a variety of restaurants, or go on amusement rides like a carousel, roller coaster, and Ferris wheel. Visitors may walk along the pier in designated pedestrian areas. From the pier there are lovely views of the beach and Santa Monica Bay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cac1234
30,Great view,The view of the pier is much better than to be on the pier or from to be on the beach. It is super over packed especially during the sunset time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vasilei0sf
50,Santa Monica Pier,"The moment my husband and I got to the hotel, we went to the pier. I was Sunday night and was packed! Do not wait until later in the evening to go. Monday morning we went first thing and it was perfect. The views are perfect.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claireraymcmanus
20,Tatty!,"This just isn’t what you imagine it to be. The beach is amazing but the pier is old and tatty, just so far from what we were expecting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FregleKid
40,Exciting place to be after sunset,"An amusement park on the water! The location makes for a great experience. Located in the heart of Santa Monica, when done, just walk back up to Ocean Ave, where an endless selection of restaurants and shopping awaits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/007mitchells
50,Fabulous,Loved every minute spent in Santa Monica from the Pier to the Shops:) what’s not to love💕Friendly people everywhere💕,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smac2712

40,The end of the famous Route 66,"A place to visit with the family. A relaxed walk at sunset. Normally it's crowded, but in mid september is a good time to visit and see many interesting things at this Pier.lots of activities to do, food to try and places to take great photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juanjillousv
50,I recommend a visit here if nearby.,"We visited the pier as was close to our hotel, there are nice little shops and music on the pier while boasting its beautiful views of the sea, it makes for a nice few hours out to relax.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brittannyb
20,Disappionting,"We were disappointed with Santa Monica and its pier. I didn't feel very safe; lots of people who seemed to be drunk/high. The pier obviously hasn't been updated for a long time. Walked the length of it and thought 'is this it?'We did a 14-day roadtrip through California and LA was a real let down, wish we'd spent more time somewhere else instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W0rdSmith
50,Santa Monica Pier-A World Class Place To Visit!,"Santa Monica pier and surrounding area of Santa Monica is a great place to spend a classic day at one of the most world famous Southern California locations.Great I'gram location for hundreds of great photos.Lots of parking,food and restaurantsand nearby shopping centers-A world class place to have a great time!....#santamonicapier,#santamonica,#southerncalifornia,#californiadreamin,#californiadreaming,#waynesalvatti, #californiabeaches,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/waynefromcali

40,Great place to run,"I was staying in the area during a visit with family. My morning run along the peer and then along the beach was the best part of my day! The pier itself has lots to look at on a run. I didn’t stop in any of the stores or restaurants, but it was definitely a fun place to visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ExploreAZcouple
40,"""We enjoyed""","We walked all the way to the end, lots to see didn't take any of the rides but took time in some of the stores ""Bubber Gump"" took some time but all good, well worth the visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Explore694115
30,Old and Scruffy,"I don't get the 5 stars people are rating Santa Monica Pier, it's nothing special to be honest and we found it to be very dated and over priced in the food area's.Considering it's meant to be an iconic pier in California, if this is the best they can offer, they really need to try harder. We're from the UK, and have some fantastic piers that knock the sock of here.Sorry, I just didn't get it, not great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheNatster75
50,Wonderful!,We really enjoyed our time at Santa Monica pier. It looks very much like what you see in the movies! It was pretty expensive paying for each kid to only want to be there a couple hours. There wasn’t much shade or covered area so that made it difficult. Other than that it was beautiful to be a part of something so grand!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amyh6711
10,Grubby and worn out,Wow what a worn out run down pier with homeless people traipsing up and down. Nothing of any real interest to see or do unless you count the delusional “entertainers” along the pierWould not recommend,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/harvchan
50,Great,Santa Monica was the first place we visited on our LA trip and it was great! We stayed for the sunset and it was breathtaking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matthewsanderson1703
30,Not what I expected,"We stopped here because we’ve never been and felt like it was something we should do. I always thought Santa Monica was a nicer area and thought the pier would be no different.Wrong.The pier is crowded, dirty, smelly, full of vendors selling touristy junk, and lots of homeless people. In the blocks leading up to the pier and on the pier. Some minding their own business, some outright begging.Parking in the nearby structure is free for the first 90 minutes so the best part was.... we didn’t stay long and got to park for free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leahb908
50,Nice and Fun,Lot of things to do!Best: rent bikes and go to Venice Beach.The 3rd promenade is very nice.And the Pier has magic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lolipascual
40,Bucket list trip,One of the items on our bucket list trip was to stop at Santa Monica Pier. Doing this trip in September meant less people which made it easy to park and walk around. The pier was clean and easy to view things. Plenty of eating places and gift stalls. It was a typical pier but glad to have seen it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolineH549
40,Lots to see,"We stayed about an hour and rode the ferris wheel ($10 each) while we were there. We took the usual photos at the end of Route 66 sign, there are good views of the beach from the top",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GO50
50,Best boardwalk,"My family-friends and I enjoyed a stroll along the pier. Great gift shops. Musicians. Letter artists (so talented). There is a carousel and ferris wheel, and other attractions. Don't forget the restaurant at the end of the pier.The pier is the end of Route 66!What a fun place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LynnS290
50,The Ferris wheel is a must do!!,"Flew into L.A. and headed straight to our accomodation in Santa Monica. To stretch our legs we went for a short walk to Santa Monica Pier. A great entertainment area with restaurants, gift shop and most importantly Pacific Park entertainment area.Comprising numerous rides Pacific Park was a great place to go.For a view over the beach and Santa Monica you cant go past the Ferris Wheel. A good length ride with great scenery. Reasonably priced and weWell worth it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paul24507
50,Date night with the wife and kids,"Perfect weather, good company, with games and food all around. Not much one can ask for. Had a great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rog619er
50,Packed Pier!!,"I love piers so visiting here was high on my To Do list and I loved it! Visit earlier in the day during the week would be my advice as it is packed at weekend and later in the day. Sadly the pier shop near the carousel was shut on the 3 occasions I visited despite saying it opens at 10am and the carousel was closed off twice and couldn't find an operator for it on the 3rd attempt. There are plenty of other shops selling pier souveniers though, some of the eateries are very expensive compared to the UK but were very busy so they must be good. There is something for everyone on here, & I believe they hold free concerts here with local bands on week nights",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whitbyabi
50,Loved it,"If you're visiting Los Angeles then how can you not take the time to visit Santa Monica Pier? It's a fabulous place, with a number of different restaurants to choose from, a fairground, the beach and lots of beautiful people. Quite a few people that aren't beautiful too - us included.It's easy to get to if you've bought tickets on the bus tours or you can simply get an Uber. Do go, you won't be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigCol63
50,World famous Pier!,"Highly recommend for a Saturday morning, music scene throughout the pier, fresh fruit vending, restaurants, lovely views and if you are lucky enough, you get to see sea lions swimming around the pier! Had a great time exploring last weekend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariacuevashunter
50,A most stop,The place is perfect for a break from everyday things. It is fun and ready to enjoy with beautiful people. Just be ready to have a unique experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SanntiagoF
40,"Fun vibe, good for mornings","We came here for sunrise and were treated to a magnificent view and experience. Hung around until stuff started opening so we could grab some breakfast; everything, ranging from food to attractions seemed to be good but not great on their own individual merits.There's a semi-clean public bathroom and a fair share of vagrants milling about - seemed harmless enough but it's wise to keep one's wits about them. All and all though, I was glad we stopped here to start our day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MKB1701
30,It's okay. But not into amusement parks the beach is better,The beach is beautiful and it's nice to walk along the pier but really there's not much to it. So if you are not interested in going to the park part with the carousel and rollercoaster etc then there's not much on the pier except for some souvenir stalls etc. We were only on it about ten fifteen mins then left,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/320bridc
30,Nice to see,Did not do the rides but it is a cool sight to see and people watch. It was very busy but worth the trip and walk down the beach front to get ot the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aloria3
50,A fun visit,"This well-known tourist attraction is fun. There are lots of things to look at and the vibe is excellent. If you are visiting the area, then you should allocate some time to experience all that the pier has to offer. How many piers have you seen with a Ferris wheel and a roller coaster on them? There are also eateries and shops on the pier as well as nearby. Lots of action!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eaglewhiz
40,Worth a little visit,"Very busy place, but worth the visit especially if you have kids. The ‘theme park’ on the end of their pier is $30 approx for all rides or $5-10 each so worth getting the full pass and doing everything.The view from the Ferris wheel is amazing!Definitely could do with a little update, but overall is a great place to visit when in Santa Monica",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgiar251
50,Santa Monica Pier/beach,Great diverse area to visit so much going on to see and do. Some nice eateries up the street also. Very cool vibe and good people watching.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DiannaF816
50,Worth the cisit,"Great for tourists, plenty to see and do. Easy food options and located a short walk from the train station so easy to get to and from.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itsmelammas
50,Iconic boardwalk and beach that is just too busy,"You really can't visit LA and miss this iconic boardwalk complete with Ferris wheel, arcade, dozens of restaurants, street performers, and of course the pier itself along the beach. The atmosphere is lively and reminds you of quintessential California summer, but it gets super crowded especially on the weekends. Parking is a problem all the time, and good luck finding a spot on the beach on the weekends. Still, there are plenty of amenities which makes this a good spot for families with children/special accommodations needs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MWTTC
50,Amazing,This was super fun and I had family come in from out of town. The pier is beautiful and there is so much to do. From food to games and rides it has it all. The kids enjoyed it and we all had a great time. We found some cool gifts at the shops and the weather was amazing. Definitely somewhere I wanna come back to when the family is gone. Being a local I never really visit and I forgot how amazing it was here. If you have family in town this is a must visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RyGriffith
50,Family fun!,"Santa Monica Pier is a must-see if you are visiting Santa Monica or the surrounding area. There are a couple of restaurants and food stalls. However, I would suggest eating elsewhere in downtown Santa Monica as the food on the pier is overpriced.The arcade is a lot of fun and there is so much to do for everyone in the family. In the evening you can watch the beautiful sunset and, at nighttime, go to the very bottom of the pier to watch the fishermen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meg305
30,"Check it out, but nothing special","We did Santa Monica and Venice Beach in the same afternoon. They are both very commercialized and can get very crowded. Santa Monica could be good for families if you had kids that wanted to ride the rides. We personally just walked the pier to see it, but did not spend much time. The food is overpriced, so we moved on. I would say to see it if you are in the area, but I would not rave about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EaglesFan27
40,Lot of things to do,"We arrived on a hot afternoon after having driven the entire morning. We did stroll around the boardwalks. There is plenty to do.... for amusement park enthusiasts there is pacific park on th pier along with all its bells and whistles there are also many shops to grab a quick bite or a drink. One can also laze around on the beach, but be prepared for the crowds!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wolf668
30,A must go to place but not overwhelming,Interesting place with several shops selling overpriced cheap stuff. Did have a good lunch at one of the venues. Too many homeless take away from the experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelkD7466XC
40,The place to be,"You really can’t visit Santa Monica and not go to the pier.Recent history demands pier security be in place. So, just like the airport you must empty pockets and pass through a metal detector. Not complaining - grateful for stepped up security.Restaurants are on the pier as well as souvenirs shops and carnival games. You can fish, ride the Ferris wheel (seen in many movies), take great scenic photos of the ocean and hillsides and just watch an array of people passing by.Wear good walking shoes and watch your step because the pier is uneven. Bumpy ride for strollers and wheelchairs.While your there, enjoy the beach below or stroll or bike along the Oceanside walkway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/297PaulaL
40,Overcrowded,In the morning it is a wonderful place. After 10 o clock the tourists enter the Pier. The prices there not very competitive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robbor570
40,Lively!,"Visited the Pier just before midday on Labour Day, the place was really busy and lively. All the eateries were busy and the pier in general had attracted a lot of people. If you have kids it’s great, plenty of stalls, kiosks, rides etc. If you don’t have kids, but still young at heart you will love this place. We don’t fit into either of those categories but needless to say that we thoroughly enjoyed a hour here people watching, grabbing a coffee and getting the occasional great photograph.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reacher33
40,"Nice pier, Great beach","We had visited Santa Monica briefly on a tour of the city, and liked what we saw so went back later in the week. The pier is a tourist attraction, so buy, but not rammed, and you can walk around easily enough. Lots of street artists / buskers along the pier, some good some bad, some just plain amusing. None hassle you for money, and it was quite nice to sit and listen to the music while looking out over the ocean.The funfair is small, and around $5-10 per ride. There's a nice restaurant at the end of the pier, and a Bubba Gumps at the start of it. Both have views of the ocean,The beach is long and very wide with golden sand.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/837andyk
30,Very commercial,"Go and have a nice drink in the restaurant at the end. Very crowded, in August i will have i think twice a week nice concerts. In case of any event at the pier be prepared for security check.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeaBi
50,Made My Day,"Los Angeles is all about Hollywood but I am not fond of Hollywood movies except few movies & Web series.So the moment we hit this place we actually got the Adrenaline Rush. This place is full of Euphoria and the Cold Winds Nourished by the Pacific Ocean actually gives us the feeling of Tranquility.Live Music, Beer, Beach, Sea Food, Fresh Fruits & lots more this Pier had offered us !!!Must Visit Place :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gparlie

40,Pier and beach with easy parking,"You can easily park your car next to the pier. You might need to clim the stairs to the pier, but it will take you a minute from the parking area. From the pier you can walk up to the Santa Monica stores above. This we liked more in the end.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mijnprofiel
40,Busy beach in LA,We are very much excited to visit Santa Monica Pier as it is one of the major attraction of LA. We found the beach is very crowded and less organized which is somehow expected. The food was nice specially sea foods. worth of trying. The park is awesome.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/243debabratas
30,It was ok,It looks pretty neat from afar but I wasn't overly excited to see it when I got there. It's a pier with an amusement park packed into it. I took a quick wander then walked out. It wasn't a bad place but I found I wasn't overly interested once I got there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/westcoast778
40,Pier visit,"Pier has some shops. But especially the forrest gump shop and bench, end of route 66 are it' s main attractions",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jerodkey

30,Family vacation,"I know it’s a historical place, and lots of movies and tv shows have been filmed there, but it’s really not that great. A few restaurants. A couple of places to buy Knick knacks. Really expensive rides. Don’t make a special trip for it. Parking and traffic is a pain in the butt.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SassyLaura2018
40,Worth a look,"Went here and spent the afternoon on the pier and on the beach. Clean and safe, the rides are basic but good fun. Food choices are good. If you have a choice between here and Venice Beach I would pick here, Venice Beach does not feel safe at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulF302
50,"Amazing place. Please visit, ignore the negatives. Read on.........","I am a huge fan of Santa Monica Pier. The sights, sounds and smells. The street performers, the artists, the musicians. LA personified. People trying to make it big. People trying to make it small. And those just trying to survive.Of course everyone is entitled to their opinion and here is mineThere are some reviews here that don't like the crowds, the homeless people, the street vendors, the sideshows etc.It is an amazing place, in an amazing location. This attracts people. People attract other people. And inevitably, hoping to get something, those people attract others wanting to benefit from those people.Whether it be the performers playing for their tea, or next weeks rent. The homeless hoping for a something just to get through the night.Yes you get the odd nuisance person, as they will go where the people go. The beach beneath the pier is vast and it sits aside a city with over 4m people in it.Our 4 year old had a whale of a time. The arcades, the amusement park, the music and the sea.Please, go. Experience. Accept it for what it is, and enjoy it all!!We have been twice, and I have no doubt there will be a third time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardChubb

30,Mary Jaaaaane,"OMG....spliff smoking, bong gurgling every where. Bit off putting, but it is what it is. Lot of homeless people who keep themselves to themselves. Its different.....not a place for kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darrenc544
30,Must do but not return,Another of the LA must do's busy typical tourist trap. Walked the pier watched the surfers photographed the sign and left $15 parking fee poorer - no real instinct to return no glamour as is often associated with it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdD836
40,Legendary,"In all honestly I have seen better piers here in the uk 🇬🇧 but there is something about this place that makes it special.I was surprised to see the amount of homeless people and addicts within close vicinity of the pier. Don’t even think of buying anything here because it is so expensive, it is beyond belief.The beach is beautiful and so is the park overlooking the pier. Stop here for some good photo opportunities. Unfortunately this is not for the weak hearted as this area appears to be a little bit on the rough side. Homelessness, drugs and alcohol abusers, and hustlers are all common place here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/De_Rycc
50,Mrs Rehana Ansur,"We spent a long vacation in the states, in Los Angeles, California. We visited the Santa Monica boulevard and the pier very often. Very lively & good vibes. We simply loved this experience and would do it again and again 🥰",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rehana14025

40,Santa Monica Pier,"The pier itself is very busy - a lot of cafes, shops, many people. But close to other streets, shops, restaurants. It is easy to get to other places from the Pier. The Santa Monica beach itself was great. But I preferred to spend time a little bit further then the Pier where it was more quiet",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/658lenarag
40,Great to have a look but wish it was sunnier!,We visited Santa Monica for a couple hours on a day that ended up being quite cloudy and windy so that was a shame. We did have a good stroll up and down the pier and stopped for lunch at Maria Sol.Glad we didn't plan on going on any of the rides as the park was closed for a private function for the day. I did stop at one of the little artist stalls and had a very sweet picture made - the man charged $1 per letter which was a bargain for me as I only wanted three letters drawn!Worth a look but now that I've ticked it off my list I don't think I need to come back again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samkuzmar

40,Sunny day on Santa Monia Pier,Great to revisit the Pier. Very popular destination. Stopped for an ice cream and took in the Pacific Coast View.

30,Touristy and crowded...but lots of families,"Although I grew up in SoCal, I had never physically been on the Santa Monica Pier...until this trip. Kind of fun to knock off a bucket list item. It has a few carnival type rides and attractions, some fast food also Bubba Gump Shrimp is there as well. Nice view of the coastline once you get out to the end of the pier. Street music and artists, some itinerant preaching all add to the vibe. Nice place to people-watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UtahTraveldude
20,"Beautiful beach, so so people","We went to this beach for 2 hours on a Saturday night(5-7pm). While the beach it’s fairly clean, and quite large, there is a large population of homeless and drug users walking around the beach. We walked for 40 minutes and it didn’t matter if we were north or south of the Pier. I would not go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicksG4375ZE
10,Crowded place,"The place is very crowded, dirty, with cheap food, and has nothing in common with memorable views over the ocean.The beach I saw around was full of people having bath with their clothes on.Disappoiting place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brialisa

50,A MUST VISIT IN LA!!!,"If you are in the LA area, you must visit The Santa Monica Pier! This attraction is phenomenal at any time of day! It is shown in tons of movies/shows and really if you only go to one place in LA this is the spot!! We visited in the mid afternoon, stayed till sunset and then enjoyed the pier with all the beautiful lights on!!!! Soooo much fun and so much to do!! We people watched, got on the rides ( get on the carousel if it is open), played/ran on the beach, ate lunch/dinner and snack, and shopped at the pier shops!! We visited with my 93-year old mom, my teenage boys (16 and 13), my sister and husband. Everybody had a great time!! Don't forget to take a picture of your group with the Santa Monica Pier on your way down or up!!! ENJOY!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aliciamG1366GK

40,LA Tourist trap - but in a good way,"If you go to Santa Monica, you have to walk the pier. It’s an LA institution. It’s going to be crowded with tourists but it has tons of things to do - restaurants, sitting areas, games & rides for the kids - to satisfy everyone in your group.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coreham
20,Dull and unsafe,"Could not see the point. There is nothing this place offers that might be interesting at all. It was reasonably crowded when we went and I felt quite unsafe, both due to the setting and also to the type of people around. We just peeked in and went straight away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dr_cooke

10,The So Cal Place to Skip,"Oh where to begin...over priced parking, crowded disgustingly dirty pier, filthy rides, street hawkers and cheap food. I went 20 years ago and wow...what a shocking difference. Our teen boys wanted nothing to do with the rides. We were harassed three times by people wanting us to find Jesus. Yelled at by a mentally unstable man that we were going to hell if we didn’t repent. Watch your pockets and bags. Drive by and look or stand at the entrance and take a pic but do yourself a favor and save a trip walking down the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Campbls
50,Beautiful sunsets and sunrise,"Been here for both sunrise which is much less crowded and peaceful, and the sunset on a Saturday night where there is a boardwalk which rivals Coney island in NY.Great ambiance and lots of vendors selling churro and lighted Disney toys. Definitely check out the fishing area at the end of the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JCtennis8
40,"Beautiful sunset, great for photoshoot","Early 30s couple, traveled to LA for a few days. Stayed by LAX and the pier was a very cheap Lyft ride, considering how long you could spend there.We arrived about 2.5 hours before sunset. it's free to get to the pier, but the rides themselves cost. We had dinner at one of the restaurants on the pier (I forgot the name), but EVERYTHING for food is expensive! They tax on everything, soda/pop cost us $4 each at the restaurant! It was good, but if I had known ahead of time, we would have just had a picnic on the beach.As the sun set, the pier came alive with lights. If you have a thing for photography you'll have a blast! Underneath the pier also has a beautiful setting for pictures. When you're on the beach, it's clean, wasn't very crowded. Good street art there as well.Any other questions, just ask!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brothablake

50,The sea here is beautiful!,"During our 7 night stay in LA, we visited Santa Monica beach & pier twice. We have 3 children aged 17, 12 & 9 and they loved it here. Beautiful views, sand is lovely and warm, sea is beautiful and warm to after a couple of mins. We spent ages in the sea both times.Facilities on the pier for getting changed etc are very good. Plenty of food to choose from and plus the rides (we didn’t go on any but people seemed to be enjoying them)A very pleasant trip both times",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Basi5

50,Fun and historically interesting place to spend several hours or the day.,"Santa Monica Pier is one of those historic places to visit in Southern California. There are plenty of activities for both children (amusement park rides) and adults. Music, some good restaurants (Bubba Shrimp), lots of action and a good place to people watch if you enjoy that. It can get very busy on the week-ends, but in some way that is part of the entire Santa Monica Pier experience. Great place to enjoy beautiful ocean views and feel the ocean breezes. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parvatip2018
50,Cool place but can be crowded...,Very busy late in the day but easy access earlier in the day. If you want to go to Bubba Gump make reservations or wait for an hour. There are other good eateries on the pier. Kids liked the rides as they hi-lighted the Santa Monica part of our vacation . Great food in Santa Monica!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/547randyk
40,Historic and social media friendly...,"You've seen the world famous entrance sign and the pier on TV, in movies, interwebs, etc...Yes, it's definitely a must visit once. It's still fun for me after years of visits...Street performers and activists congregate by the entrance sign. You walk down you get a great elevated view of the pier. It's packed with locals, tourists, families, couples, etc. On the pier there's cafes, street vendors, amusement park rides & games, full service sit down restaurants. Street food options and desserts are your best bets on the pier. You get great views of the beach and the Pacific Ocean so there's plenty of social media moments to be made here.I'll always visit the Santa Monica Pier whenever I hang out at 3rd Street Promenade. Every visit I make a new memory and I reminisce of recent memories made at the pier throughout the decades. May you create some cool ones here yourself. Cheers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ninong247

40,Fun pier experience,"This is a typical seaside pier experience, so while it’s no Disney, it’s still a lot of fun. It’s free to go on and there are loads of things to see and do, from buskers to souvenir shops, to arcades to rides.Yes, it’s very busy, and yes, the rides are overpriced for what they are (the unlimited wristband offers better value if you’re there a while) but we still loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jawsie1

40,So much fun,First time in LA so we decided to go to Santa Monica Pier. We did some shopping downtown and then walked on the pier late afternoon.

20,Put me off as soon as we had to undergo security screening,"It felt like a seedy amusement park on a pier. Our first impression was having to pass through electronic security screening, which we hadn't anticipated. A non-English speaking official just pointed at what I was carrying and mimed what he wanted - I found this highly irritating (and rude) so I eventually told him that he needed to talk to me if I was to understand what he wanted. Non-existent customer service - we're tourists contributing to the economy but they seem to have missed that. Wouldn't bother with the crowds and officialdom.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RachelH860

50,Get the bands,"Always a great spot. Try to get onto the ferris wheel for sunset, you’ll never forget it. Plenty of deals out there for unlimited ride wristbands, without the it’ll get pricey quickly. Do three rides or more on a deal and the wristband has paid for itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClanClark
30,"Little crowded, little crazy","Big day at the pier. It was pretty crowded, even though there wasn’t anything special going on.

The sea looked stunning as well.No weed small either but oh my good go further up to Venice and it stinks.Some good restaurants nearby also.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/disneycjd
10,Skip this and go to Malibu instead.,"The area (this pier in particular) isn’t worth visiting if you’re only in the Los Angeles area for a short time. I question the motives of any blog and/or website that tells travelers this is a must see. I’m sure back in the day it was. But the vendors crowd the pier and there are WAY TOO MANY people allowed to fish off of it. They take up so much room.It is in desperate need of a facelift. I can’t help but wonder why in an expensive city like Santa Monica, this “iconic” location has been left to look and feel so terrible.It smells. It’s trashy-the beach. It’s overcrowded. Go down the road a little ways and enjoy Malibu and Malibu’s beaches. It’s a busy place, but it is a better experience over all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amstockton

30,"Just to have seen it ""live""","After seeing the pier in numerous Hollywood movies this is probably a must to most people visiting LA. Nice beach, easy parking ($10) and well worth spending an hour or so just to being able to tell your friends that you have been there the next time you see it in a movie. Oh and the “Fortune-telling machine” Zoltar from the Tom Hanks Blockbuster movie “Big” from the 80’s can also be found on the Santa Monica Pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fretel1891
50,So much to see!,"Not sure exactly what I expected, but this was MUCH more! SO much to see and do, you could easily get here first thing in the morning and stay until late night. Not sure I love the buskers at the start of the pier, they sure are friendly, but snapped back the ""free CD"" as soon as I told them I had no cash to offer. We stayed for a few hours and had a very nice wander, along with a lovely meal at the end of the pier. We stopped at the Route 66 kiosk where they do quizzes and hand out completion certificates, but we were starting the Route that day (westbound), so we got some GREAT advice and had a nice visit, but we'll have to come back for the certificate later.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beakertroyd
30,"It's Ok, but a must do, but sooooooooo busy!!","We really did not like SM at all, so busy! We walked down to the pier having parked in the upper city area. This was just so busy and so many vehicles around, but luckily a nice walkway down to the pier!! There is a lot of attractions and shops and eateries, but this attracts so many people. It's good to say we have done it, but unlikely to revisit. Recommended to tick off a list!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MPP2703
20,nothing special,"This is fine for kids or someone who would like a quick casual meal, but otherwise time could be better spent at other Santa Monica venues. Navy Pier in Chicago is much better, except for the weather.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erwink820
40,Quick visit,"The pier is massive and very busy, but well worth a visit. We didn’t buy anything or go on any rides, but it all looked good. It was pretty windy, but that made a nice change after the heat of Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkAnf
40,Take a jacket,Nice area to visit and admire the ocean. The parking was difficult to get to. a few shops and eating areas.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adjunior
50,Amazing walk,"Full of color, fun, there is a ton of people around, cool shops, t-shirts, bats, good food, I found it a bit pricy but it was ok, great to people watch and have a nice day with ice cream and the kids",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReginaJefferson
50,Nice and relaxing place,"We spent a full day of activities and relaxing the pier. 3rd street is not far from there with a cool mall, stores and lots if restaurants. I piked with my kids for few hours. It was a great day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K1234NXammara
40,Lovely day on the pier - go early!,"I took my 2 adult daughters to the Santa Monica Pier on a Monday. We mainly went to see the beach and sea lions that swim around at the end of the pier. Our Lyft dropped us off at the pier around 10:30am, which gave us time to check everything out, take some pix and see the sea lions. We were also there when the Pacific Park rides opened and the ticket line was lite. $35 pp for the all-you-can-ride wristband, which was the most cost effective choice, as most a la carte tickets for the ""big kids"" rides were $8 each . There are 12 rides in total and my kids rode about 8 of them (the 4 exceptions being kiddie rides). See also my review for PACIFIC PARK.Overall - the pier got more crowded as the day went on, so I was glad we got there early. There are a ton of gift shops, all selling pretty much the same trinkets. I got something from a small ""cash only"" stand. Wasn't expecting a cash only situation, but always like to keep a few bucks on me ""just in case"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/necowgirl
40,Lively busy location.,"The pier is busy all the time, we had a stroll along it early evening 8pm. The bright lights from the fairground attractions are vibrant and colourful. There are numerous fast food places and ice cream and sweet shops. Gift shops, T shirt and baseball bat shops etc. Lots of families with young children and people walking dogs and couples, a good mix of the generations. Prices are inflated but that didn't seen to stop people buying and having a good time. We spent 39 minutes there as it was very busy . Young people, children and the young at heart will enjoy it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q6842WCjuliec
30,Touristic and dirty,"A must see, but in fact not very attractive. In desperate need if renovation and a clean up (bird poo all over).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edorlas
40,The Only Thing Missing was a View from the Top!,"The Santa Monica Pier is an iconic piece of Americana and it was just how I wanted to end my solo trip to California. It was a cold, windy day but that didn't deter the crowds. The arcade was bustling, the rides were going and it was just cool enough to enjoy a hike from the pier down to the Venice Boardwalk and back. This is a must-see if you've never seen it. You'll recognize the sign and many stores from television and movies. It was a near-perfect California day. Note: I had visions of spending the day by the ocean and enjoying the beautiful view from the top of the ferris wheel, but they don't allow solo riders! I'm a happily married woman who enjoys solo travel. This is the first time in all my travels that I've been unable to enjoy something because of it. Still, the Santa Monica Pier and surrounding area was such a great experience, I'm only dinging it a point.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saratravelssolo
50,Wow,"Something I've always wanted to see. It blew my mind that there was parking on the pier. The carousel is beautiful, amusement park pretty cool and the information boards at the end of the pier was informative. Plenty of restaurants and souvenirs along the walk. Definitely something to see and do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/938elizabeth
40,Fun Place - As Any Other Pier!,"The Santa Monica Pier is quite similar to other such piers or boardwalks that you will find at other port cities in the US, and as a matter of fact, in UK as well, such as Brighton and Blackpool. There’s a ferris wheel, a carousel, a roller coaster, arcade games, a couple of restaurants/cafes, and LOTS of people! The pier is just next to the Santa Monica Beach, which is convenient. There is ample paid parking available. As a tourist, it is better to visit the pier, the beach and the 3rd Promenade on the same day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShoaibShawoo
40,Iconic but expensive,"A must see, free to walk up and down the pier, but very overpriced, eg $4.50 for a small bottle of water, and very busy. Worth it for brilliant views of the bay however.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dansN6381MX

50,The Beach is Gorgeous yet Fun!,"The biggest and most beautiful beach I have seen. It was a little crowded, but not uncomfortable, I was able to be in my own zone with the ocean. The pier was a lot of fun, albeit quite expensive $10 just to ride the rollercoaster. The worst part of my trip was the traffic getting out of the city. Overall I had an amazing time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JsAdventures
50,Great place,"We spent a great sunset at the pier. The kids had a great time running on the beach, and enjoying corn on the cob. Fun, food, music and more. It is must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelermomus
40,Good food and Good times,"If you have been to the big parks like 6 Flags, you will appreciate that this one is small but incredibly well maintained and fun. The biggest difference is that the food from the vendors is amazing. It could be that Texas parks have crappy food, but the food is really good here. Any vendor that we tried, we loved it. This is a great 4-5 hour activity. It gets busy in the evenings, so if you are on vacation, go early in the day before the crowds pick up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Camino_Jim
50,Summer staycation!,A great time with friends every time we come to Santa Monica! There’s always a lot going on and tons of people.

40,One of the highlights of the trip,"Now this is the LA I expected- came here for a quick visit, but really enjoyed it for the people watching and a bit more of the real LA experience- it’s mid summer so it was chaos people everywhere just peopling... the beach was packed. Noise pollution everywhere as everyone competed for a few inches of beach of space on the Pier. It was nuts (ps I don’t like crowds). But the atmosphere was great and we all had fun... I would go back to Santa Monica again... (possibly stay there next time) we did get stuck in a traffic jam on the way home at 8.30 pm on a Sunday night. (But that’s LA). But damn now I can’t get that Cheryl Crow song out of my head!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/biancab347

40,Great ocean view,"What a fun place! We just walked up and down but I imagine if our kids were with us we would have been testing out the rides. Bought a top from Buba Gump Shrimp to keep warm and we did not know it was the very end of ""route 66""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nataleighs
20,Crowded. Try to avoid,"It's good for a quick walkthrough, but it is way too crowded to be safe.Furthermore, smoking is not allowed anywhere on the pier, so this is not a place that a smoker would enjoy.There are better places to have fun in this city!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NikosM1661

40,the end of Route 66 !,"If in Santa Monica, you have to go to the Pier as an honarary tourist! It's a must. Go in the day time for less people or go in the evening if you love crowds. There is Bubba Gumps restaurant in the beginning and a few other eateries along the way , with one more at the end of the pier. Watch fishermen attempt to catch a fish. See vendors of all sorts for your official souvenir and listen to musicians up and down and all around looking for a small donation for their talents. There is a good little soda shoppe down at the beginning of the pier that is easily missed. Good Sundaes and icecream at reasonable prices and a carousel inside the building for the young and old to ride. There are also a few amusement park rides in a carnival atmophere off to the side with the iconic roller coaster that can be scene for some miles away and looks cool all lit up at night. Santa Monica Pier is also the end of the line destination for the historic Route 66... where everyone gets their picture taken at! :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chips57

30,Santa Monica Pier,"Extremely crowded, but it’s pretty cool. I love coming here for sunsets, but parking is extremely hard to find before the hours of 7pm when parking becomes free in some spots. There’s performers toward the end of the pier, and they’re pretty entertaining to watch. Pacific Park is expensive ($10 for one ticket to ride the roller coaster), but it’s a tourist destination so it’s to be expected. Despite hundreds of people being on a pier that I am shocked can hold all of this, I find it very relaxing coming here and watching the sun go down. Down on the beach, they’ve even got flags of the different counties.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TessaAndHerThoughts
50,Summer Family Vacay 2019,One of my highlights of our trip was walking the pier. Great ocean views. Good people watching. Ate dinner at Bubba Gump Shrimp.The only downfall was my husband wanted to see Muscle Beach at Venice beach. GPS says 2.2 miles away and it took us 1 hr to get there. And Muscle Beach is “closed for renovations. But we got lemon ice on the walk down and walked the beach shore back (50 min back to pier).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/savy-mama97
30,We like the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk better,"After hearing so much about it, we were surprised on our recent visit here to find that there wasn't much in the way of rides and the whole experience was like being on a conveyor belt walk in and out.

40,OLD-SCHOOL AMUSEMENT PARK,"It may be a bit kitschy but this old pier can still entertain the kids. My 12- and 8-year-olds had fun on the Ferris Wheel and playing some of the carnival games. It's no Disneyland but it's not pretending to be either. If you're not careful here you could spend Disneyland money for nothing close to the same experience but, if you pop onto the pier, take a few rides/games and leave, it can be a fun hour or two.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeeDubYVR

40,Typical pier,"Walked around this popular attraction with friends prior to a meal at Gumps. Lots to do, take the Ferris Wheel for great views. Recommended",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PKH624
20,Disappointing and with parking problems,Overpriced activities of poor quality huge problems finding a parking place even though we paid 15 usd,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarstenP633
40,A west coast verson of Coney Island.,"As you walk down the ramp from the top of the Palisades, the crush of people, views of Ferris wheels,the smell of the ocean, the mustard on a corn dog and sound of living is your sensory emporium.To enjoy big city beach, this is it. Wide stretch of sand, sun and water. Unfortunately you now have the homeless sleeping on the beach which makes the beach after dark a dangerous place to be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/acK4559SP
50,California Family Vacation 2019,"We went to Santa Monica Pier with LATour1 as part of their Small Group Highlights Tour of Los Angeles. We booked through Viator. We enjoyed the Santa Monica Pier very much! We liked it so much we went back another day before flying home. Lots of things to do & see on the pier. Rides, restaurants, musicians, vendors, etc... Also a huge beach to lay out on or play on. And an aquarium and a huge carousel!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RitaJoMo
50,Teens loved it,We visited this beach and Vience beach on the same day. The teens loved both beaches and really liked the carnival rides here. The wife liked the Promenade shopping here the best.There was ample public parking and getting in / out was relatively easy compared to Vience beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garyt200
30,Overcrowded! Go early!,"I visit the Santa Monica pier every time I'm in Santa Monica (3x per year)... and every time I ask myself WHY did I do this? Unless you go very early in the morning, this place is thronged with tourists! Even if you just want to wander to the end of the pier to take in the view, you'll have to run the gauntlet of selfie-taking, ice-cream dripping, goggle-eyed tourists, families and teens all wandering (seemingly aimlessly) around the pier, the amusement park, the beach, and the streets immediately surrounding the pier itself. It's definitely worth a visit. But my favorite times to do so are early early in the morning (like 8 am, before a lovely breakfast on the beach).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seatowngetawaygirl
40,Tastefully Tacky,"A notch up from a carnival, it is tacky but felt safe with reasonably present and visible Santa Monica Police and pier security. Highlight is Trapeze School of NY if you feel a bit inspired for mild adventure and a bit strenuous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcl08
30,Disappointed,"First of all do not drive to the Pier. Uber or research where to park because ALL of the parking along Hwy 1 was closed. North and South lots were full. We drove several miles trying to get to a lot that was open and it was a huge headache.Next, once on the Pier there were several people strategically located with loud speakers preaching our doom, death, ultimate eternity in hell. Just when you think “oh good, passed that” another one will start back up. This takes place the entire length of the Pier.It was also super crowded which I can handle and expected because of the parking.We got appetizers and drinks at Mariasol’s at the end of the Pier. It was good and fun.I’m glad I went and saw it but after the hour long journey of finding parking, then being screamed at by the preachers, and completely consumed in extremely large crowds of tourists (just like me) I would recommend not going in the summer months, afternoons, or weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lvngbstlfe
20,To crowded,"The pier had way to many people! It was barely standing room only. If everyone would walk or move to the side it wouldn’t be so bad. It was just to congested and busy for us to get to enjoy. We walked to the beach but, it was even worse. I do not recommend it at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amyhass
10,"Overpriced, overcrowded, and not much to do","All of the shops were souvenir shops. 90% of the street performers were terrible (Literally there was a ""magician"" tearing a rope in half and putting it back together, and a scary-looking 60-year old man singing karaoke very poorly.) The food options were not appetizing and the ""theme park"" at the end of the pier was, um, bad. There is one roller coaster and it's biggest drop is around 10 ft. and goes less than 30 mph. The rest of the rides were all only for children. Even the bumper cars were no good (all one-way; no head-on bumping). The beach looked nice and clean, but it was too cold to go. The aquarium at the front of the pier and the century-old carousel were both nice attractions, although small. I would recommend spending your day at any other LA beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/corbyers111
30,Not as nice as I remember,"Although still a beautiful view, this place is now full of homeless. A bunch of gift shops and people trying to sell things. Great for pics. Leads to the free beach where you are also getting harassed to buy things",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/132tarad
50,Fun,We biked from Santa Monica to Venice Beach and back...great views out to the sea and people watching. Sadly our whole trip around California has shown so many homeless people and thats the case here too. Worth doing - 2 hours well spent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenbZ3999ZG
50,Wonderful!,"So much to do here, we loved it! From buying souvenirs to enjoying a nice dessert at the Funnel cake, it’s the best. You can enjoy lively music and watch the ocean waves, it’s beautiful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Raintreeflower
50,The iconic pier overlooking the Pacific Ocean!,"The Santa Monica Pier is iconic and classic California. Often crowded, but worthy of a stroll along this wonderful spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanaLosAngeles
30,Fine,"I guess it' a good place to have a drink and watch the ocean, or to take the kids for a ride in the amusement park. But I didn't enjoy it. I felt that it was just a bunch of people trying to sell me stuff concentrated in one spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eib2017
40,Pier or Amusement Park,"This is an amusement park, Ferris wheel and more, built atop a pier. It is an exciting entertainment centre. It was crowded on our summer visit. Lots of load music, some live.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/InnaYYZ
30,Felt Obligated to Visit!,I could have gone without it but... we were here and we can say we did it. A local tried scamming me by I called my husband over & quickly he disappeared. I saw ZERO security. And a place like this needs it. It’s your typical local carnival. But probably a lot more expensive. We’re touring California and this was a historical landmark that we had to experience but honestly unimpressed. It looks better from the hotel in the distance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SparBoys
20,Busy touristy pier,"There’s not much to say. Santa Monica pier is a busy, touristy, crowded pier with shops and eateries. Though we enjoyed taking a pic under the Route 66 end of trail sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolemp2
30,Try Again In the Winter,I was really excited to see the Pier but i feel like i didn't get to see any of it because i was fighting through crowds to walk down it. It's a beautiful view and it looks like a lot of fun but it is so crowded. Early morning might be the best time because any time after 11am is a mad house.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bucketlistbook
40,Great Experience!,"I went here to see pacific park and enjoy the beach on a late afternoon in April. I was super excited to see this place, and it didn't disappoint me! Pacific Park was super fun, and I loved the ferris wheel. The rides were thrilling or basic (but fun), and we enjoyed the gorgeous sunset while in Pacific Park. The area is overall nice, and there were friendly people there. The beach was amazing too.It was a bit crowded, but enough to handle. But I did not regret going here, in fact I am very glad I got to see this place. Overall, it was a good experience, and I do recommend going here, but it is crowded sometimes, so be sure to keep an eye on children.I hope this review is helpful. Be sure to ask questions!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelReviews_WithMB
30,Very crowded but worth seeing,"My friend and I spent about 45 minutes total on the pier. It is very crowded and hard to walk around on because there are so many people. We ended up going to the amusement park and riding the ferris wheel, which gave us a fantastic view of the sunset and the ocean. Just be prepared to bump into lots of people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hmill42894
30,A bit tacky,"Worth a visit, but it was so busy that we preferred just strolling along the promenade and taking in the view",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joelN3186WV
30,Very crowded and ppl don’t care you’re pushing a stroller,"It’s a popular place I get that but ppl aren’t mindful that you’re pushing a stroller. Cutting in front of you, when you say “excuse me” they just look at you like “you want me to move.” I’ve been before without children and it was alright, don’t understand the big hype.The ocean area itself was good, we’d walked down under the shaded area since the sand was so hot and the kids enjoyed themselves in the water for awhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlaytimewithMiss_T_e
50,Highlight of our trip to CA,"Loved the atmosphere here. Had a great time, ver safe - fun riding the roller coaster. Ate at Bubba Gump, very good food. Good purchases of T-shirts",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C5863UIlaurieb
50,Keep your memories @ The Pier Santa Monica,I love this place and it gives me a real positive energy. It is not our first time and I hope it will not be the last.Enjoy your time there specially in the early morning or @ sunset.Have a meal or a drink there :) enjoy your time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Samehelsheikh
50,A Pleasant time at the Pier,"The pier has a great selection of activities and restaurants which to enjoy, along with a number of iconic sights to see. It is a great place to walk around, people watch, or grab something tasty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladyjustice977
40,Crazily busy,"If you are fancying a nice quiet stroll down the pier then this is not the place for you, this place is loud, lively and totally buzzing with atmosphere whether it’s night or day.Personally don’t see how you could visit Santa Monica and not go on the pier. In terms of cost you have to remember that this is a tourist hot spot and the prices reflect this I would suggest parking away from the pier and walking in. The hustle and bustle and diversity of live entertainment itself provides you with plenty of opportunity to soak up the ambience, there’s magicians, artists, musicians, preachers amongst many.Couple of things to watch for are on approach to the pier are the scam artists with free CDs and people dressed in costumes offering to have their picture taken with you but then demanding money for this. The cost of the food on the pier is high but keep an eye for little places off the pier like Big Deans where the food is cheaper and far better quality.Make the most of the pier as it is a great source of entertainment, weekends in the summer you can’t really move and the road down to the pier is shut off by the local police.Enjoy people 👍",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevinhG3474JF
30,"Was ok, nothing special but worth a visit!","Visited here with my family do different really to the piers in the UK. Tourist shops, food, the usual nothing special to see. Beach is lovely though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nichola8
30,Expectations too high?,"there are so many homeless people here, so many hopeless camped out along the front of the pier it’s difficult to ignore their plight and just head on in, spend money frivolously and wastefully. I thought all of the dine in places were over priced, the street acts forced joviality with the entertainment on the low budget/high charging end. There are stunning photos that can be taken of the pier (give yourself a bit of distance and some dark), grab some street food from the vendors on the beach (real Mexicano) and get the kids a fun balloon.Parking is horrendous with looooong delays getting out so if you can wrangle it use some public transport or phone a friend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luvinspoonful
50,Touristy but a must do!,"Pretty at night but Busy! Go during the day, take a stroll, enjoy performers, water and hillside views, rides with kids, and vendors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DunnTrips12
40,An hour is enough unless you have children,"I was there for maybe 40 minutes, it was more than enough for me. I would imagine that this would be a lot of fun with children but other than that it is a bit of a tourist trap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJICE
40,Great,A must when in la. Very large pier and very busy. Lots to see do and buy. Get your dollar water and churros from the little ladies on the walk up. Stunning veiws,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O8167QZlisab
30,"Dirty beach, huge crowds ,","Not a great place as the beach is very dirty , has lot of crowds & resembled a village fair . The roads are always full, difficult to get a taxi though electric scooters are available for rent. Nothing seemed great. Just an AVG place hyped up",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Medapati
30,depends,We were only there for a short time. Parking was $15 and it was already 4pm when we got there. the pier and the beach were quite busy. The longest line coming off the beach was to rinse off. was advised by a former LA resident to leave before dark. no obvious indication as to hy as of 5;45p but it wasn't dark. if you are looking to be by the beach with a ot of people on a hot evening this is the right place for you! Glad I went but not sure I would go back based on my preferences.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T4209TIkathleend
10,"Don't visit, waste of time",There was nothing special about the pier and it was extremely touristy. There wasn't anything in particular to see and we came on a foggy day which made it even worse. Avoid.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RyanM7105
50,Fun and scarves!,It's a nice stroll and there was a kiosk near the entrance where I bought several beautiful scarves and beach cover-ups.Heal the Bay was fun and interesting.This is a good way to spend a few hours on a sunny day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeannieTheCastigator
30,"Neat place, Rides are ridiculous prices for what they are","So we loved the pier for walking around and pictures, walk on the beach etc.... Neat view at night. You can grab a bite to eat. As far as rides I was a little floored. It was $8 a person to ride the boat ride... just the little boat that swings back and forth. We paid $28 for our 3 kids to ride that one cheesy ride for 1 minute. That sounds stupid ridiculous to me. Honestly think about it, by the time I bought them just 4 cheesy rides it would have paid for a Disney land ticket for all day unlimited good rides... luckily my kids didn’t find anything very interesting there they felt they needed to get on. The rides would be more exciting for a 10 and under age group I think. Everything else I did enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patricia21675
40,Something for everyone,"There is lots of parking. We paid $30 to park at a restaurant just off the pier but there are lots of options. There are many places to eat, from sit down restaurants to food trucks and snack stands. We ate at Bubba Gump’s and it was fantastic. We felt very safe so our teens stayed at the amusement park and did the rides which were quite pricey. We opted for the all you can ride bracelets. My husband and I strolled the pier and watched the buskers- some great singers and magicians. It was a great way to put in an evening- very iconic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annelavoie2017
40,Great family fun with basic facilities,"Santa Monica Pier and surrounding beach were lively and crowded. There were ample restaurants, shops, street performers and folks selling beach supplies and ice cream. The public bathroom facilities weren’t great and we didn’t find a changing area. There was only one spout to wash sand off after the beach so it had along line. Parking was a very close walk and $15. The spots were very narrow. The state needs to renovate all public facilities at the pier, but it still is a must visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericgT8885HO
40,Fun place to spend a few hours,"Crowded yes, expensive yes but it is the end of Route 66. Some good eats and fun for the kids. Worth an afternoon",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heath2489

50,Amazing pier with lot of fun activities to do,"Since we were visiting this place on 4th July 2019, there were throng of tourist. Great amusement park, we could enter for free. Since huge lines we didn't sit on any of the rides... locals were enjoying summer activities on the beach.. Metro station is at 15 mins walking distance",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wanderlust_Bhavna
50,A fun day!,"We visited the Santa Monica Pier and spent the day on the pier at Pacific Park (I did a separate review of the park). If you just wanted to attend the peir, I'd suggest going in the morning! On the day we went, it was crowded and more crowded as the day went on. We arrived early, about 9am, in order to go to the park ahead of the crowds and at the early hour it was far less populated and very calm.You can park directly on the pier in the morning, but we noted it was closed in the afternoon. Parking on the pier is $3.75/hour or a max of $18 for the day. We spent 7 hours on the pier and riding the rides at Pacific Park, so the $18 was well-spent for us. We were close to everything we needed and were able to return to our car several times for drinks and snacks in our cooler and save the money from buying those items at the ballpark style prices on the pier.The beach area looked wonderful! The bathrooms were plentiful and well-cleaned when we were there. Overall, it was a fun time for our family with young children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/briaj86
40,Worth a walk through but not what I expected.,"We were here in May 2019, it was worth walking through and it being free made it worth it but honestly, wasn't really anything special imo. I guess we were expecting something bigger, more grand but it was like 30 minutes to walk through or less and then done.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcrann
50,Pacific Ocean feeling - the beach you saw in movies as a child,"Being Europeans and seeing many movies/series filmed in Santa Monica we were looking forward to visiting the area. The Pier indeed exceeded our expectations! It was our first time seeing the endless pacific ocean and it was magnificent! It is like the feeling you have when you reach Nordkapp in Norway, where Atlantic Ocean meets Arctic Ocean. Santa Monica’s Pier has a nice platform inside the sea were you feel like reaching the end of mainland and new adventures lie ahead. From the touristic point of view, there are many things to do and is friendly for pets and families with children. Even in winter it worth visiting!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gerasimosdo

30,OK,"This was a site I wanted to see at the end of our road trip. I was taken aback by the sheer crowds of people. Packed like sardines. A lot of homeless, tourists and pick pockets. Glad I saw it but I'll not revisit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Feebee283
30,Just OK,"Santa Monica Pier was recommended to me and my husband by everyone we know, just because it’s essential that you have a stop at the pier if you’re visiting LA.Our personal experience was just ok, we had a good day: games, roller coaster, typical souvenir stores, places to eat (meh).Parking is full. It was overcrowded, full of tourists (of course, like us, but some people don’t like this). We didn’t like at all that the place felt dirty and smelled like marijuana! Homeless people all over the place asking for money. We wouldn’t recommend having babies in a stroller when you go to Santa Monica! Just because it is not something you’d want your babies to see, feels unsafe at times.If you’re okay with skipping this touristy spot, do it. You’ll only miss that typical photo in Santa Monica Pier, that’s all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/silviss90

50,Amazing place,"We loved our day in Santa Monica so sooo much. Yes it is touristy and pricey but there is no where else quite like it. You can spend the day on the beach swimming in the sea and rent bikes to ride up and down the sea front, visit Venice and then come back for an evening on the pier with the wheel all lit up and a great atmosphere. Would 100% do another day here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilyw703
50,So Much Fun!!!!!!!!!!,"We had a blast on our visit to Santa Monica Pier. Definite must dos are ferris wheel, the scrambler, and check out the gift shops. One thing we did on the pier that was my favorite, was there was a stall with an oriental person who was painting your name. They charged only a $1 per letter and you could get a frame for $5 to protect it. Gorgeous and done within a short amount of time. Lovely to dip your toes in the ocean while you are visiting the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/235nickit
40,"Wonderful shops, beach is a little dirty.","I stumbled upon Santa Monica after fleeing Venice Beach, yes I fled, quite quickly I may add from the filthy beach and homeless scene. Santa Monica is a gorgeous location. It is home to many clean, beautiful shops and eateries. It’s a much, much better place to take your family than some of California’s other beaches. If you want to take in a gorgeous view of California scenery, this is a good location to do it. Lush greenery, beaches, and a mountainous back drop make it a breathtaking view. There is still a homeless problem at this beach, but not on the level of several other beaches I had visited in the state. I think that California needs to do a lot better job of regulating this than they’re currently doing, but all and all, a nice location!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tlorisko
30,Over priced and over populated,Went to the pier because that’s what your supposed to do when in Santa Monica. 30 minutes to find a parking spot then a mass of people. Would I go back? no,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanL516
40,Iconic & worth a stop,"If you’re in LA area with kids, this pier and beach are worth visiting. Prepare to pay to park, and be ready to pay $5-$10 per person per ride on the pier. Yummy food options such as the Japadog hotdog cart. Lots of people from all over the world. Big waves around the pier and some surfers. Walk a little ways down the beach to find a cleaner place to wade in the surf. We enjoyed the Ferris wheel; went around several times and had great views even on a foggy/smoggy day; it was $10 per person. We found it worth the drive out to Santa Monica (staying in Universal City).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeggySATX

30,Much less than expected,"After flying in from Hawaii, we decided to play tourist and visit the pier until our hotel room became available. In short, I'd say that we weren't impressed. While there are plenty of games and rides for younger kids, there's not much for the adults other than shopping, food, and people watching. The beach is also an option, possibly the best option for the adults and the only reason I'd ever return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/only1cochisebrown

While now I can cross this off my bucket list, I have to say I was NOT impressed. It was run down and the night time crowd was pretty sketchy. We went back the next day and the crowd was much better.

40,"Nice to sightsee, and more to do","Our first visit to the Santa Monica Pier, we spent about 2.5 hrs walking around and sightseeing. It’s a nice boardwalk. There are “street” performers, and and bunch of merchant stalls and vendors. Plus the restaurants and food carts. Moreover, there are rides, but we didn’t really go that way.Ultimately we walked out onto the beach. The sand is great and just hanging out was great. Welcome to California. 😎",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dinfamily2009
30,Avoid summer,We went to the pier as part of a day long tour through Hollywood and other places so we were only there for 1 hour - thank god! Crowds were insane! Beautiful scene if you can find somewhere to take a picture.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gmckenzie2017
40,Santa Monica Pier,"Great place to visit, would also recommend hiring bikes on the pier for an hour or two, to see even more of the area",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gabriellaw2019
50,Sweet!!,"Cute little must see location we visited in our stay to LA. The vibe was nice, tons of eateries. I recommend read some reviews prior to your visit. Games, and typical touristy things. There are a million people doing the name paintings sculptors etc so walk around and see who you prefer. The beach looked nice, however at 60deg not my type of beach weather. From the bridge on churros/water/mangos will sold be every inch of the pier. Choose accordingly lol.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charmainer2018
30,Can say I’ve done it,Rides were ridiculously expensive. Some local restaurants and nostalgic for some. I wouldn’t go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/529tinal
30,It's a pier with rides. So a 21st century pier.,"We visited the pier, rode on the Pacific wheel, had some photos, used the restrooms. It was a good experience, not much different from other piers/boardwalks though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LancasterLads
40,Great spot for all ages,"Great spot to enjoy the Pacific. Lots of places to eat, play, drink, etc. Safe surroundings . And the beach is terrific. This is a must stop if you are in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JR4IU
30,Okay been there,Visited on a weekday and walked to the end of the pier. It was crowded. Wall to wall people. Nothing really interested me.I don't have to go back. 3rd St Promenade is better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marlieh2014
50,Dinner and Ferris Wheel!!,"Santa Monica Pier is A great place to visit for couples and families. You can have dinner on the pier, ride the Ferris wheel, or walk down by the beachThe food is good and you can also go to the nearest corner and rent the electric scooters to ride around the town. You can also walk the boardwalk from Santa Monica pier to Venice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/guera2819
20,Overrated,"In my opinion, this is a nice long pier with a bunch of overpriced food and amusement on it but nothing worth making a special trip for. There are lots of options for food but nothing that really seemed unique. Of course, they have rides, but the lines were long and the rides were not. There were plenty of vendors selling photos, jewelry, and their homemade music CDs as well as panhandlers asking for donations. It was also really crowded with a lot of people that evidently never learned common courtesy. Is this place unique? Maybe, but not special in my book. Did my teenage son and I enjoy it, or would we ever go back? No. It’s certainly not worth dealing with all the traffic and people to say you’ve been there, but some people may feel otherwise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayBurgin72
40,Quick trip,"Cool to go and have a look, ride on the iconic Ferris wheel and get out! so touristy. Not somewhere I’d want to spend much time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gngj

40,A good pier,"May not be one of the best in California, but still one must visit it.Just visited for an hour or so, while shopping at 3rd street promenade. Its a fun place, with few activities going on",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/asimm76
30,Very busy....,Busy with lots of performers and visitors! Not really a lot to do unless you’re interested in the amusement park rides.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisQ1
30,A GOOD SUMMER FUN DAY,"The pier is very crowded in the summer time all day long. The parking lot on the beach is full by noon. This is a real turrest spot with a carnival atmosphere, views of the beach and ocean, rides, food and intertainment and the end of Route 66 and other gift shops.I have not been to the pier in about 60 years and it is still a fun must see attraction if you are in West LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/707clayg
50,Great stop....,"Great place to be entertained. We did not do any rides, but just checked out the sights and sounds of the pier. Witnessed a really cool magic act....There was also dancers and singers playing. My daughter got to hold a snake ($10 suggested donation after the fact....beware), and to my surprise is the end of Route 66. SO....now I've seen the beginning in Chicago and the end in Santa Monica! Awesome memorabilia to Route 66. You will not be disappointed coming down to the pier. Parking in a nearby parking ramp, which was not to expensive. Great find and stop!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U6854CLjamesl
50,"Fun, fun , and more fun!","What more could you want on a perfect California day then to check out the Santa Monica Pier!? Lots of souviner shops, some places to eat, and a perfect spot to people watch! I wish I was there right now!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dwy1

50,Must see.,"This attraction is definately worth seeing, enjoying and spending some money at.Like being on a movie set :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KnutVassbo
40,Typical fun place to enjoy with kids,"This place is mostly crowded and lot of activities going on. Hence, one may not get the peace of sea-side but may enjoy with children. There are rides, musicians, magicians, souvenir sellers and of course stalls with food items for kids and tourists to enjoy. However, after dusk the crowd may disappear and one may enjoy the place. There are a number of restaurants to enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Royadip
40,Nice family visit,"The girls enjoyed the rides and we enjoyed just walking around. The line to the bathroom was very long so we pretended we were eating at Bubba Gump and went there, where the line wasn’t near as long. There are a good many homeless in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/uscfan1325
50,You just gotta go when in LA!,Lots to do! Plan to spend a 1/2 day if you go here. Eat and play! Take a picture by the route 66 sign and buy a pass to Pacific Park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarthaWK
50,Must Visit the icon!,"Santa Monica Pier is a plus travel list, with nice restaurants Lobster and Marisol to choose from as well as fast food. The Arcade is fun for yourself or kids, or you can ride the merry-go-round, but there’s plenty to see and do on the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericcM8001BX
30,To much tourist nothing special to see,İt was very populated there and it was very loud you can go there if its on your wat but dont go extra cause its nothing special.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yasemin2323
30,Buzzing with activity (and a cacophony of noise),I went on a Thursday afternoon and the place was heaving with people who were mostly milling around it seemed. Several buskers tried to out-sing each other creating a cacophony of noise that made it unbearable to sit for too long. And the restaurants are a rip off! It's better to find a place to eat at Santa Monica Place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/faizell2017
40,Told this was a must do....hmmm not sure I agree,We went during the day. It was very windy and crowded. Lines were long and the restroom we used was Bubba Gump.I think it would be neat at night. However not sure how safe. We took photos and left. Hmmm one more off the bucket list. Been there done that. Not sure I would ever return.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Baybug2012
30,"Ok we saw it, eh","We were here at night so I’m sure it’s a different experience but it was just ok. Obviously a huge tourist so everything was crazy expensive and crowded. Lots of performers which was interesting. Amusement park is on the pier but looked fun. We hit some shops and had burgers, etc but overall it’s not anything we’d need to see again. It was cool putting our feet in the Pacific after starting the morning with our feet in the Atlantic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeS787
50,A lovely stroll,"I came back to Santa Monica many years after first visiting with my family, this time alone for work. So strolling along Santa Monica pier was a big nostalgia moment and so I enjoyed taking a long slow stroll up and down the pier. It’s all a bit cheesy but that just adds to the charm. A must visit when in town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikeyonhols
30,It’s what you expect it to be !,"The Santa Monica pier! , lots of people wanting to get your money! But that’s what it should be. An iconic site, a must see and experience at night.People from all over the world gathering together for junk food and good fun.Wear comfortable shoes, prepare to do some walking. Crowded, noisy, incredibly diverse and multi cultural.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imagemaker1
50,Nice place to chill out.,Nice place to chill out for lunch a bit of shopping. Would be great place to take kids as it has all the basic amusement park rides. Walkable distance to venice beach too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarlW1989
30,"Crowded, dirty & expensive",I have heard of this landmark for most of my life & was excited to visit but was disappointed. Very crowded and dirty. They could do a much better job of keeping it clean. Two tickets for the Ferris wheel was 20.00,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EG54
40,Rides are pricey but view from ferris wheel was worth it,"We had our Lyft driver drop us off at the Pier after the US women won the semi final world cup soccer game. We were in good spirits. The kids wanted to ride the ferris wheel and roller coaster. It's a bit steep at $10 each, but they didn't want to ride more so we skipped the $35 unlimited ride bracelet. I decided to ride the ferris wheel with them. They were annoyed at me but it was nice to take some pics of them and the view of the beach was really neat to see. I skipped the coaster which they said was so boring. Their favorite thing to do was just past the pier and swing on the rings and climb the ropes and that cost me $0. We then leisurely walked back to Venice Beach which is 3 miles and a good hour if you walk it straight, but we stopped for drinks and snacks along the way so it didn't seem so long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carrie9678
30,Over crowded,"Street hawkers, people over people, no place tj walk, sit, move, despite being sea side I didn't get a good feeling while being here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rahul_eliving
30,Early morning of peace,"While we were there quite early on a Monday the pier is starting to look quite tired & worn, as evidenced by the large amount of workmen there. At least we can say we’ve been now",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scotp393
30,Kinda a dumpster fire...,"OK, so it's the end of Route 66, it's the Pacific Ocean, it's an iconic location...but there are so many other piers that offer much better options. Be original and get out and find them! You'll thank us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clanbacon
40,Nice beach/Pier,"Visited here for a few hours- nice beach and pier. Rides for young kids, restaurants and vendors. Beach was crowded but we were there around July 4 so to be expected. Overall it was clean. Would come here again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tppenn
50,Great place to people watch,We took a walk down to the pier to check it out. There are multiple gift shops and eateries. It’s busy with people but a must see if you’re in the area. Amusement park looked fun and be sure to take a ride on the merry-go-round. It’s so cool. Park up top or park at the beach. Fun couple of hours can be spent there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/808allisonc
40,A family night out!,We popped down to the pier for their fun park with my six year old godson. We had a great night - the unlimited rides was $35USD which gave us endless turns on whichever rides we pleased. The roller coaster is great fun and the Ferris Wheel is a must!There’s plenty of food options down here too. There were also hardly any queues for the rides and most of the time we jumped straight on!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/270edenc
50,Loved it!,"This is also a must do for me! Who doesn’t want to see the famed pier, the end of Route 66? Went on July 4th so it was busy but still walked out on the pier, great views, soaked up the sun and food. Parking nearby ended up only being about $3 for our 3 hour stay. Great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NMannersF
40,Walk on Pier,Got to beach via hop on hop off bus. Took about 30 mins from Beverley Gardens Park. Lovely views of beaches and hills. Pier itself not overly busy on a Saturday. Had LA card which covers entry into Pacific Park - teenager too old. Spent a short time in the Heal The Bay aquarium. Very small - good to see the good work being done. Again more suited to younger children where they can touch various fish. Venice beach a real let down after Santa Monica.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aidenew
50,Lots to do to keep you entertained!,Spent a good bit of time in the arcade but also enjoyed the views from the pier and grabbing some great shots of the family!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DizTravelMom
50,Great day at the beach,We walked from Venice to here along the boardwalk. Great views and dipped our feet in the ocean.The Pier is such good fun. Buy a day pass if you want to do lots of rides as it is better value.The Pacific wheel gives great views in both directions.Well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O3559JIhelenc
40,Fun for a Quick Walk Through,"Being downtown in Santa Monica, we felt obligated to see what the pier was like. Very accessible, not too crowded at the time we were there (about 6pm Saturday), plenty of food stands and souvenir shops. Didn't need to use the rest room, but it looked like the lines were pretty long. I didn't see the condition of the restroom, but it obviously had heavy use. Overall, go see it if you're in town, but don't plan a trip around it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonm902
40,Take the kids...and your wallet,Definitely need to go see (especially with the kids). A little pricey and super crowded but you should at least go and see the pier. Great photos and the beach is really nice too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angier456
50,4th July..A lot of talent on the pier,"Went to America early to see 4th of July celebrations on my way home to Australia. Lots of entertainment, great hot dogs! Great artists. But where was the local fireworks?? Had to watch it along the coast line so no great fireworks photo opportunities. Need more rubbish bins so people don't continue to throw rubbish over pier. And stop allowing plastic straws in all your stores. I picked up heaps of plastic ones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/boobs68
50,Super Fun at the Sta Monica Pier,We visited this place sometime in June 2019. We got there at about 6PM. They have a lot of fun games and rides. Plenty of food choices too. Make sure to bring your jacket if you plan to visit. It gets really cold with the cool breeze coming from the sea.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/299marielt
50,Great place to visit,"Great place to visit with your family. To many things to do, see and eat. Best churros. You could see the end of trail of Route 66. It was a great evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rebeccamendoza25
30,"If you are going to the beach , stay away from the Pier!","Pier is nice to take a walk and get some nice pictures . It’s usually crowded , but it is still fun.But if you are going to the beach , drive a mile and reach the beach out of the crowds . There are plenty of beach access with public restrooms near , if you go past the volleyball courses , you will get a nicer , less crappy - crowded spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaimeHimes
30,Busy day - lots of hustling,"We went for a stroll up and down the pier. it was a beautiful day and the crowds were out. After we had patiently queued to park the car, we set off.The pier is flanked by not-so-special restaurants. There were 3 musicians and 2 dance acts hoping to draw dollars from our pockets: most of them hopeless. Their loud noise just made us feel hurried, hassled and unsafe.At the end if the pier, watching the fisherman reel in their catch as a seal happily swam in the pacific, was a real treat though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimTerryIV
50,Day Trip,"Since our plane arrived mid morning, we decided to drive to Santa Monica Pier to spend the day on our way to Woodland Hills, CA. We got there about 10am. Parking was abundant, very easy and reasonably priced. We walked the boardwalk, enjoyed the ocean breeze, and took pictures. Husband fished off the pier with no success. But he had fun. Rental prices for fishing were high considering all you got was a pole and bait. But like any touristy location, it was expected. Rode the ferris wheel and carousel. Best part of Santa Monica Pier was Pier Burger -- best burger ever! But that's another review!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chrisbry
30,A must and still a tourist trap,"Most have seen the pier in one of the many movies where it is a well know sight.Crowded, full of people trying to sell crap to you and of course expensive compared to quality. In other words a real tourist trap, but you will walk around it quickly and can then head towards the much nicer Venice beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reijob
50,Enjoyable,Excellent place to hang out. Beautiful sunset. Plenty of places to walk and grab a bite to eat and shopping!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sonyal979
40,Great view.,"We were visiting our son who lives in LA and he brought us here as he was showing us all the highlights spots. Parking was $15 or $16 for all day. There are a lot of shops, food, souvenirs, etc on the pier. We did put our feet in the water as there is a lot of beach area here. It would be nice to just come and hang out on the beach with a couple of chairs and a cooler. There is an aquarium under the pier but it didn't open until 2 pm on Tuesday so we did not get to go in. We did walk the 2 miles down to Venice. It is a nice wide sidewalk to walk on with room for scooters, bikes etc. Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the pier. (Christa)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidjensen399
30,Would not go here as a destination day trip,There were a lot of typical pier/boardwalk type of activities on the pier but it wasn't very well kept and seemed kind of run down to us. There are plenty of public restrooms. Parking was $14/day in the public parking lots. Santa Monica town was a few blocks away and seemed like a nothing-special town; again wouldn't come back here for a destination visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsO4624OZ
50,tourists,Enjoyed seeing this landmark from a distance. Illuminated at night especially the ferris wheel.Easily walked there from our accommodation in Venice Beach.Great for children. Lots of rides to choose from.Also had multiple eateries from stalls to sit down restaurants,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ausberg
50,The best if you love the ocean!!!,"Taking a walk on the pier was a wonderful experience. You have a little bit of everything. First of all, you see people from all over the world while enjoying the different musicians, drummers, piano players, erhu players, and singers. Food? You name it!! Tamales, churros, hot dogs, pizza, the best hamburger and fries!! And a bunch of fun people and families. All while you sit at one of the benches and enjoy the sound of the ocean, and the breeze caressing your face. Love it!! A must go to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jaurrietatraveler
30,Obligatory stop!,"We decided to stop here since we were in the area. Getting in and parking we’re pretty easy. The pier itself was pretty busy and crowded. We stopped at a couple shops. I would recommend using cash. There are a few performers on the pier and you can fish. There was someone at the end of the pier selling dead fish to feed to a sea lion. We didn’t stop at the amusement park. When we left, getting out of the parking lot took a very long time. It’s a good place to stop to say you did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R5453RXmichelles
30,Mini Blackpool Pier,This is a small Pier with places to eat and drink. It has those selling their souvenirs or entertaining.Nice to see but really nothing special and better when lit up at night but can get very busy especially at weekends.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnmG8857TP
30,Must visit but ok,Suppose one of those must-visit attractions. Nothing very special. Good to say been-there-done-that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grant_I_W
30,Good to Go? Yes and No.,"Because it’s a landmark, you need to visit. Both daytime and nighttime the pier is alive and hopping. Plenty to do once, although twice may be too much for teens and older. Just like Atlantic City or Wildwood in NJ, it has its charm,But too much of a good thing is not a good thing. Don’t over stay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/660rickd
40,Great walk,Lots to see and buy and eat.......performers delivering music and magic. Choice of food stalls or restaurants. Difficultly in getting vegetarian selections in restaurants on pier....out of stock. Cheesecake Factory fitted our needs better as a group of 7 but enjoyed ice cream on pier. Watched the seals off the end of the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gigle64
40,Love the pier & promenade street,"So many shops to browse & place to eat on the 3rd promenade street.Very touristy though...The pier is pretty but very crowded.Evening might be a better option for viewing the pier because weather get cool down..Also, it's really fun to hang out at the Arcade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmazingLucca7
40,Nice LA landmark but crowded,Ive been here before but its the first time i have been able to really enjoy the area since we stayed in a hotel close by. This is a go to place for anybody visiting LA. There are plenty of restaurants and shops along the pier. There are kiddie rides for the young ones. They also have an aquarium below the pier. Nice scenic view for phot op. There is parking on the pier. It just way too crowded for me especially in the late afternoon. You can also walk or bike along the boardwalk. I see there are public bathrooms and showers along the beach if you plan on swimming.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gsl_2003
40,Tourist Trap but fun,"Lots to do. Many gift shops, restaurants, arcade, and crazies. Keep in mind your at a tourist trap and it will be fun. It is also ""End of the Trail"" of Route 66!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/87vette
40,"Cool, but busy.","The pier is cool - mostly for younger kids (in my opinion). It might be cool to eat at the restaurants for dinner, though we never did. The pier is very crowded, so we found going early morning the best time to visit. The street performers we saw just before the pier were pretty cool to watch (though they do it trying to earn money). There are several different acts, worth taking a look at, versus just walking away. Some are more drawn out than others. The beach around the pier is nice. There is a large homeless population, though we never encountered any issues. The 3rd street promenade is close and I wish we'd scheduled more time to look around there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShannonNeedsSun
50,Walk from Venice to SM,I walked from Venice beach to Santa Monica Pier and it was a great walk! You see the skateboarders and the muscle gym.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/193kaitlynk

50,One of the most iconic site of California,"Looking for some food, or browsing in the stores or just admiring the sunset? Does'nt matter, the pier will enchant you for sure.

Definitely spend the money to go on the ferris wheel! It's awesome!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LocalTourist85
30,So crowded,"I think it would have been a good experience except that it was so very crowded. We went on a Saturday night, which was probably a bad decision on our part. The sunset was beautiful, the hot chocolate was good, the rides were expensive at $10 each.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnsGirl87

50,A Beautiful must see,I was expecting to be wowed and I was. The beach is so beautiful and the walk on the pier was relaxing. There are shops and restaurants on the pier and also kiosks set up. People were fishing and there are places to sit and just enjoys the cool breeze and the view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P1214KLkimberlyd
40,A must visit in LA,"The pier lies at the western end of Sta Monica Blvd and is also the end of historic Route 66. You can forego Venice beach if you're short on time, but not Sta Monica pier. Make sure to stay around for sunset as the backdrop of the Malibu hills presents a dramatic effect. While you're at it, take a dip at the beach as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eric821
50,Touristy but great,"The Santa Monica Pier is classic, very picturesque, and really fun. There is a lot of tourists in the evening but if you go right when it opens at 11 there will be hardly any people. The rides look overpriced but are actually really long and a lot more fun than they look. The food options are also very good. Make sure you get a Lifeguard Tank!!! ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sophiedM9941LW
40,Great for kids / families,"Our son loves the merry-go-round, there is a small aquarium nearby, and the arcade has rides for toddlers (put in a quarter to go on a little car or motorcycle that bops up and down.) The ski ball is also a fun classic. Only downside is how crowded it can get, so mornings are best. Gets crowded with tourists, but even more so in the summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luikalulubelle
30,"pretty trashy, good for kids",standard tacky overly busy seaside affair with a small selection of rides for kids and a games arcade. It's worth walking down to the end of the pier to spot wild seals poking their heads out the water.It's a nice walk from here to venice beach and worth going for a swim in the waves :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/456sophiec
30,Meh,We headed to the coast after a college tour. This was our first stop. It was mid-day in a weekday so not too crowded - but it was dirty and junky - not too impressive. We paid $14 to park and another $6 for arcade games and spent an hour or two there. I would not put it on a must see list by any stretch,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deebk
30,Super BUSY!,We went in the evening to check out the Pier. The water was cold so we did not get to swim. We ended up spending more time in the shopping mall area that is within walking distance than we did the pier itself. Plan on having patience to get to the parking lot! We spend approx 15-30 minutes just getting down the street to park!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/145missyr
20,Underwhelming,"We visited on a weekday in June. It wasn’t crowded and not much was happening on the pier. There really are not many stands or stores to shop at and the ones there are trashy. There were a couple of restaurants but we had just eaten breakfast. Our girls I guess have outgrown the arcade and the rides appeal to younger kids. It was cloudy and hazy so the views weren’t great and we weren’t there to spend time on the beach, which did look great. We walked to the end of the pier, and turned around and walked back toward town. I guess we expected something more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jbeetles
40,Fun Pier,"Lots of activities, and a great place to people watch and soak in the California sun. On the weekends great free stuff tents. Great way to spend 1 or 2 hours of your day in Cali.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cosmoalien
40,Fun night on the Pier,"Second time at the Pier. Love it lights at night. Girls had fun on the rides. Seems that some changes were made from the last time, a little disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adventurer611072
30,If you can suffer the crowds...,"This is mostly a mediocre deal until you get to the end of the pier, where you have a beautiful perspective on the shore. Skip the midway crap and rides and BS.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pzmfsmith
50,Lots going on,"Whether you want to play in the water, hop on a ride on the pier, fish, or grab food, you have all the options. Good arcade with plenty of normal games and lots of entertainers on the pier also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ktflow3
40,Overall a good experience,"My visit to the pier was a very good experience. I visited with my children ages 19, 17 and 9. Parking was very reasonably priced. I do advise that if you plan on riding rides you do pay for the bracelets to ride all day regardless of whether or not you plan on staying there all day. On average it was $8 a person to ride 1 ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cccook1979
30,Iconic must do,This is an iconic must do when visiting Los Ángeles. We’ve gone every time but as my kids have gotten older they have expressed that the rides are “Lame” and the midway games boring. Our entire visit lasted less than an hour. This was an add on to our visit at the last minute because we had a free day. Now I regret having wasted the hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lindarplusfour
10,Small and overcrowded,"I was really excited to check out the Santa Monica Pier, as it is highly recommended by most tour books and blogs. However, I found it overcrowded and underwhelming. There are much better things to do while in Santa Monica!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erinbU186DZ
30,Stroll,The beach is huge an the rides were fun for the kids. The amount of homeless people let this place down though. Very sad to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Manstar80
40,Great people watching.,We had a few hours so we made our way to the pier. It is an iconic landmark after all. We didn’t ride anything but did enjoy our stroll looking at the Street vendors.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferdP938AH
40,Lots to do.,We enjoy the Pier and boardwalk. We enjoy the games and boardwalk foods. The rides are for smaller kids. The beach is clean and well protected. My girls enjoyed all the exercising equipment in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColbyHannah
40,End of the Trail of Route 66,Great place to visit while in Los Angeles. The Santa Monica pier is the end of the famous route 66 - once upon a time the mother road of the US from Chicago to Los Angeles and made famous in a song by the same name.There is also an amusement park on the pier called Paradise Park. Lots of fun for children and adults alike.Plenty of restaurants line the place.Near the famous muscle beach of yore. Great place to swim in the pacific.Amazing sunset view!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lachmanbalani
50,Santa Monica Pier,"Go back in time! This pier is over 100 years old. There is a roller coaster, ferries wheel, carousel, fun games and lots of food. Fun for everyone!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M16303
50,Nice place to walk around,"Easy to acces and walk around to area. At morning peaceful to walk, afternoon to mid night there is lot of people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/102ninak
30,Overrated and super touristy.,"Santa Monica Pier is perhaps the most well known beach location in the LA area, but it’s way too touristy for my liking. It’s packed to the brim with European tourists and US tourists. If you want an authentic LA beach experience, try Venice and Manhattan Beaches.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Natesmith1016
50,Loved the Pier,"We spent six days in Santa Monica and had a number of visits to the Pier. Always something happening- entertainers, people ready for a friendly chat, and some great food places. A great atmosphere and easy to recommend a visit or two to this pier. Loved our time here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W7182HGmariem
50,So LA,One of those places you just have to do to experience all we think LA is. Go in the evening for the sunset and then stay to get the feeling under the lights.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markandcathycalgary
40,It really is a must when in Santa Monica,My first full day in Santa Monica and visiting the peer really is a must. A nice easy walk with lots to see and a really chilled atmosphere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VMP28
40,People Watching Pier,"Parking can be a hassle, so if possible take public transportation or try to visit at an off time. Great people watching, food and fun. You never know what you'll see--from Hare Krishna singers to Ray Charles imitators. And then there are the rides and attractions. On top of all that, it's a historical site, and also features the natural end of the famous Route 66 (take a selfie with the sign denoting the end of the road). Short walking distance to the Third Street Promenade, a pedestrian mall which features a lot of dining options.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimtZ7231HS
50,Santa Monica Pier,It is an experience to not miss while in Santa Monica. The lights and busyness is fun!! The entertainment to take part in is such a variety there will be something for everyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonyandarylk
50,Such a FUN Time!,"I thought the crowds would damper the fun, but not a chance! This was such a neat area. The roller coaster is simple but fun, and the Ferris wheel is a classic! I'd love to bring my kids here someday!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mom2Twincesses
30,Good for small kids,"Nice walk down onto the pier, commercialised as you would expect and prefers to suit young children for the rides and attractions. Great little ‘nick nacks’ to buy in the end of the pier R66 shop.All in was a good place to visit but suits younger children and looking very dated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndyB5045
50,A fun place to visit,"Stopped just for a few hours, but really enjoyed the visit. We didn’t take the time for the rides, just the street(pier) performers, the shops and the beach. You must stop if you’re in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/766donalds
30,Ride the Ferris wheel,"The Ferris wheel is awesome. You get a great view of the area from all sides. I like it better during the day than in the evening. The rest of the pier is really like a carnival with games, rides and fast food. Busy with tourists and pretty cheesy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DHHWWH
50,Famous for a reason!,"You can't visit LA without visiting the famous Santa Monica Pier. It offers amusement rides, shops and food, and has a great beach. So glad we got there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LucyT756
10,Santa Monica Pier,"Dont bother! Full of rubbish, stinks of weed.Avoid going in June - June Gloom hits and sunsets not around to make it a worthwhile visit.Cold month to visit LAPeople discard electronic scooters so sidewalks difficult to cross sometimes too.Only good thing is Metro station very close to pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/670karenw
40,Santa Monica Pier,"A very crowded and buzzing area, shops, restaurants, funfair rides, street entertainment. Busy at just about any time of day or night. A little tacky maybe but interesting all the same.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonytt_11
10,Too crowded,We actually couldn't go. Parked very far away. We tried to go but their was way too many people. It was disappointing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeeBJohn
30,"Nice Pier, Dirty water",The Pier with all the activities and food options were great. But the water quality and sand leave much to be desired! Trash on the beach and a light stench in the air.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Caj928
50,Beautiful day beautiful place...,"From the airport took the Metro Rail. The Metro Rail will take you almost right to the Santa Monica Pier.(app. 8 min. walk). Great place to shop, go on rides, walk on the beach, look @ the ocean & enjoy the free entertainment. Had a wonderful day here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScenicTravelBug
30,Way better in photos,I guess is a “must see” but it looks way batter in photos than reality. Plenty of homeless and other beggars everywhere. Not a lot of options for eating. Prices for “not-so-great” rides are excessive. I liked the street performers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngelO235
20,Pile of Pier!,"Yuck! This tourist trap gets so much attention since it sounds appetizing. In reality, it’s a dirty, small wooden pier with a handful of carnival rides and really bad food.Skip the pier for a Southern California beach day and head to Malibu instead. This pier is the pits!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TRVLtruth
40,Beautiful place to explore ...,"Santa Monica is really a beautiful place to explore - can be pretty busy and crowded - lots of opportunities to sit in and dine & wine - good for families, couples and singles",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlatinumForeverDUS
30,Nothing special,Came for a look as was spending day at nearby Venice beach. Basically a pier with some rides and food stalls. Probably better for kids and young families. Got a funnel cake and it was terrible - and cost nearly $10!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joekerr23
50,Great old fashioned fun,"Easy to spend half a day on the pier with lots of restaurants, old fashioned funfair, street entertainment and shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveRDay
30,Quick Stop for a few photos,This was first on our list of stops from leaving LA to head up the coast to San Francisco. Messed up and parked a few blocks away in a parking garage when we could’ve parked right at the pier. Good views and had a lil food. Be good place for kids with the rides and food.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tommyp863
50,Vibrant and buzzing,"A cacophony of colour, noise and smells. People from all walks of life having fun. Rides, candy floss, popcorn and all manner of fast food.There is a Ferris wheel and a rollercoaster and other rides. Great for kids and a nice atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sudo62
30,It’s a pier with the usual hawkers and so on,"Has a world famous name and small funfair, otherwise it’s simply another pier. The main attraction are the coastline and beach views. Glad I’ve seen now it but it’s not massively memorable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Craig1961_01
50,Santa Monica Pier roller coaster ferris wheel,Very busy packed full of people worth a visit we were limited for time so didn't stay will be going back to experience another time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicholer377
50,it was very beautiful,The beach was very beautiful.There were so many nice people .The fruits were very tasty.The street performers and the performer at the pier were amazing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K4105EHjamesj
40,Fun for Families!,"The Santa Monica Pier is a very busy, arcade, rides, food, shops, and people-watching hotspot. Prices are not inexpensive but it is Santa Monica. There are things to do for everyone from little ones to seniors. There is parking on the pier but it fills very rapidly. However, there is good and convenient indoor parking right across the street in The Ocean parking garage. Staff there was friendly and price was reasonable. There is a steep slope from the street down to the pier itself so please bear this in mind if you are disabled as am I. I managed but it was a bit awkward and people were prone to push to get past me. Once you reach the pier itself, things widen out and it’s more manageable. There are a bunch of arcade gaming places and several rides (roller coaster, Ferris wheel, antique merry-go-round, some other whirl you, spin you rides for the more adventurous. Hip hop and breakdancers off to the side, pushcarts with popcorn and cotton candy and the like, and a lot of shops selling the usual tourist fare. There are a nice selection of restaurants (see my review of my favorite, The Albright) and some tasty homemade ice cream on the pier. The view of the beach and particularly, the ocean, is beautiful. It is crowded so plan accordingly but I enjoyed my visit and would recommend it, especially to families.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoriJMK
50,A Good Memory,We went to this place in a tour on Memorial Day. Lot a people their. Very good memory of a place where movies had been filmed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheyssa
50,pretty cool place,my son was very happy with all the attractions and the food could be a whole month there without stopping to go a single day because the whole environment is friendly,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodneybangalters
50,Fun and vibrant,We went on a relatively cool day and really enjoyed it. There's lots of energy and people having fun. We did not do any activities but there are lots of amusement park rides and games. We had no trouble finding parking. The area was pretty clean and well maintained. There are public RR as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K1187HBlisag
50,Looff Carousel is a Must! Lots of Photo Ops! End of Route 66,"Park right on the pier. The Looff carousel is an absolute must. It's a classic by the most realistic carver of the golden age of carousels. There is a pig and a goat in addition to all the horses. The tilt-a-whirl cars are shark mouths, which is cute. Make sure to look at the old photos and read all the history - this is the inspiration for Popeye. Lots of places to eat. This was plenty of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanK751
50,"Very nice place to visit,",Its a nice place to visit. Little bit over crowded but a must go. The weather was good so I enjoyed a lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chandanomkar2007
30,It’s Ok,Came here to visit while in town. Obviously very touristy with loads of people. Many restaurants fast food and sit down. Several rides and games as well. I guess you have to walk the pier since you see it on tv so much.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nailcutter
30,End of Route 66,"This large pier with food places and a large old style theme park, is nothing amazing. Probably just a good location to say they you made it to Santa Monica beach. Route 66 finishes here and there is a small display about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aussie_2012
10,One of the sketchiest places on earth,I’ve been looking forward to seeing this pier for months and man can I say I’ve never been more disappointed in something. This place is horrible. More crowded than a Disney park. Never felt so unsafe walking somewhere. Everywhere you looked people were just smoking weed. This is definitely not a place I would ever take a kid.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomasblaze9
50,Very good indeed,"Fantastic place, lively and great atmosphere the rides are for everyone and not too scary but definitely lots of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deanandkate6
40,Just a fun place You can get everything in Santa Monoca,"Good fun, a place for tourists or locals, when you don't want to play Disneyland prices. Sea food, desserts etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lb887
40,My second visit,I went with my son. It was his first time and my second time. The first time I went was in November 2011. June is NOT the month to go. It was extremely crowded. Lots to see and do. Next time we will go when school is in session. This is my sons last year in high school coming up. So no restrictions on our traveling plans after that. Try those French Fries across the street. DELICIOUS 🥳 #ILoveLA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coils
40,Always fun but wheelchair be aware.,Santa Monica pier is one of my happy places! First time visiting while in a wheelchair and getting to the pier attractions is possible but very steep- wouldn’t recommend in a manual wheelchair without an attendant - going down was hard to control even in a power chair and coming back up would be near impossible in a manual. There was no way to access the beach from the pier without steps.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kamikidd
20,Holiday,I found the Santa Monica Pier to be very uninspiring. The huge carpark in front of the pier really detracted from the area. There were numerous attractions on the pier with eating outlets etc but having always wanting to visit there if I went to America I was very underwhelmed!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterdH4975MD
40,Nice Place for a Stroll,"This place is a nice place to finish your stroll along Santa Monica beach, a bit touristy of course but nice views and some really good buskers playing some jazz or blues, go to the end for some nice Mexican food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/franv654
50,Fun times for all!,"This place is awesome! I’ve been to California many many times and never got to hit the pier. The place was packed! My hubby and I walked the entire thing and then decided to have some fun. We got some passes to ride the roller coaster and the Ferris wheel. We had a blast like we were 13 again hahah. The coaster is small but has food turns and dips. Plus, they run it twice so it’s not as short. The Ferris wheel is such a beautiful sight. No matter which way you sit, you have views of the ocean and the beach, plus some city views. It was pretty cold the week we were there surprisingly, but it was beautiful and refreshing.There are a lot of kids there and families so patience is KEY. It’s as packed as any amusement park so be ready for that. All in all we had a good rime and the boardwalk itself is clean and great to take pictures with friends or family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nikirock777
40,"A ""tourist trap,"" but a fun one","Nothing on the pier is much different than what you'd find at any American beachside resort, but it's clean and well maintained. And it is the ""end of the road"" of the old Route 66, so fans of the historic highway will especially want to make it a stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CareyMartin
50,Great old Santa Monica attraction,Take a walk down an authentic wooden pier. Ride a carousel or a kids roller coaster. Try your luck at arcade games or grab some great food at Bubba Gump’s. There’s a very good Mexican restaurant at the end of the pier. A fun day and always beautiful to be by the sea.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jrk9789
50,Beautiful!,Loved it here! Anyone that watched Three's Company will appreciate visiting the pier. It was just as beautiful as I imagined it to be!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Quest630575
30,Another L.A. sight.,Glad we went just to say we've been but apart from the carousel and big wheel it's another L.A. commercial tourist sight.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenwR1075QV
30,Too crowded,It is just another commercialised place. It was very crowded. It was very windy when we visited this place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaithiliSave
40,"Busy pier, cloudy and misty evening","We walked down onto the pier on our first night here - the weather wasn’t great, cloudy and misty. The arcades and carousel are nice to see but aside from this there are street performs and it can appear a bit tacky. Worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dale7987
40,Great weather and great vibe,"First time in Los Angeles and of course visited the world famous Santa Monica Pier. Great weather, great vibe, the real Californian spirit here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coenvdbrink
40,Nice pier and extensive beach,"The pier denotes where PCH meets Route 66. A nice old pier, worth a visit. Parking nearby and beautiful looking beach to look at from the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikec244
40,Nice,The pier is relatively short and you can walk it in a few minutes even with a crowd.The shops are reasonably priced. The kids working the Funnel/Ice cream shop are very friendly and did a great job. The Pepsi machine broke and they had the quick thinking to have the shop across serve me the drink. I was impressed that they did that very quickly.The weather was great and there were several people out and about.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/acostajesusb
50,Santa Monica Pier,"Love love love the pier! Every trip to Cali we wind up here one way or another LOL. Lots of souvenirs, great views, and even an amusement park makes for one terrific day (or night!) Parking can be tricky but we lucked out and got there early on a Sat morning so we could get a spot in the beach lot. Walked up some steps and BOOM right on the pier for the day. The kids tried their hand at games in the Pacific Park Amusement and everyone left with a prize. Spent the rest of the day watching live performers dance, do magic acts and drum along to music! Had dinner with the family of (9) at Bubba Gump Shrimp Co and the kids got wet in the ocean. Packed a carry all bag for water bottles and swim stuff plus whatever else they wanted to buy. (Most places dont give u a big shopping bag so bring your own!) Prices for items were definitely reasonable.Stop at The Coffee Bean for a mid-day pick me up. The line may be a little long but worth the wait. We spent two days on the Pier and hit them up three times. Walk to the edge of the Pier for more breathtaking views, you won’t be disappointed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judithh0718
50,Ferris Wheel,I went on the ferris wheel today at night time. It gave a good view of LA and what it offers. I really enjoy this place and I hope i can get back on it in the daytime once again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M9900EKkarenn
50,Fun Place!,This is one of the typical tourist spots but still worth the visit. The views are great and you can enjoy the restaurants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/220kenq
50,The icon that defines Santa Monica,"If you mention Santa Monica, the first reaction is inevitably ""the pier"". It's probably more interesting on your first visit, and yes, it is getting more dirty every year, but there is still some interest here for everybody; - eating, drinking, rides, walking on the beach, views - so yes, you can't come to Santa Monica without visiting the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonWamberal

30,Great to see!,"Great to see. I thought it was a little tired looking. There is a small fun fair, souvenir shop, cafes, traditional beach style toilets! People fishing, few homeless people, lovely views and nice clean, well kept beach. This was the beach where Baywatch was filmed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PamelaM1412
30,Kinda bummed,We may have picked a bad hour or maybe just because it's summer but we couldn't enjoy anything here during our stay at we were looking forward to this the most. Too packed and lines were too long to get tickets to ride the rides or play games. My daughter was really disappointed. First time on the west coast and hopefully when we're back we can have a better experience. Also for anyone going for your first time be mindful there are alot of haglers trying to sell their products. We got approached by several.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackiesN2826DN
40,Vacation,Great pier and people watching. A few too many homeless lurking but over all the pier is great and def a place to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcdeligirl
50,Family Fun,"The kids enjoyed some rides, the weather was a little chilly when we went, which was fine. Crowded, but what do you expect of place such as this. My expectations were realistic & it didn’t disappoint. Buy wrist band for rides, it’s cheaper & look for the otters at the very end of the pier, begging for food. Adorable. Don’t forget to get you photo at the end of Route 66, if you traveled that route. We did!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdventureOnTheMove
50,Landmark,This iconic pier is the end of Route 66 and a quaint and iconic landmark. It reminded us so much of piers in the Uk that we felt very much at home.The views of Santa Monica beach are breathtaking and you can access the boardwalk up to the ocean itself from the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/victoriak687
40,Excellent place to visit,We went there midweek to avoid the weekend rush and was not disappointed. The pier was clean and it all seemed well organised. Plenty of nostalgia walking along the pier harking back to 50’s. Well worth the couple of hours to stroll along and take in the sights including Santa Monica beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pca1958
40,Second time,"It was my second time here. First tim, I was in awww! Second time, still am! Where I come from we don't pier. So seeing this for the first, I loved it.

30,Touristy,Visited here yesterday and it’s just your usual collection of trashy tourist shops and dodgy eateries . There were some quite good buskers who saved the day and provided some fun atmosphereDon’t go out of your way,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bucketlistgrandma
10,"Sorry to give this one star, but the few rides they have are so expensive......","The Santa Monica Pier Roller Coaster is really short and costs $10.00 to ride it once! The Wrist Band is on sale right now for $31.45, but there's only 12 rides in the whole place, some of those are for small children, and there's NO dark ride at all... Honestly, just go to Knott's Berry Farm if you want a HUGELY better Value... It's as low as $49 for an adult to get into Knott's!! That's $17.55 more for three amazing rides with Animatronics, a very nice Ghost Town with authentic buildings from an actual Ghost Town, several of the best roller coasters anywhere, and more!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffN898
50,"You've Seen It On TV 1,000 Times Now See it in Real Life","I live less than two miles from the pier and am admittedly biased, but it really is a wonderful place, a mix of old timey fun and new. I've been coming to the pier since 1984 and probably haven't gone a week without a visit since. It has changed a lot over the years, but it's always remained a run place to soak up the sun, watch the world go by, and see a sunset. Couple warnings - it can get very crowded. If crowds bother you, this is not a place to visit. The food on the pier is not as good as the food above the pier. If you're too tired to climb back up into Santa Monica, eat there, but if you have the energy, eat up on Ocean or Third.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RicksforFree
20,Very small,The peer itself is very small. Parking is a nightmare. The vendors were not very nice or helpful. Not much to do. Nothing really stood out! We ate Dinner at Bubba Gump’s and it was good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ginb2019
40,A good place with great potential,"The Santa Monica Pier is iconic on a global scale. The best views in Santa Monica, a historic location as the end of Route 66 and lots of charm. Where it falls short is the lack of healthy options in one of America's healthiest cities, and the overall cheesy, cheap and sometimes unsafe feeling you get when visiting. I'd love to see some higher quality performers, at least one organic restaurant and more events that encourage healthy living.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ajaliwins
50,so much fun!!,"My daughter got to do the trapeze class, and I cannot recommend it highly enough!! We took a 9 day trip all over California, and the trapeze was the highlight of the entire trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieS1058
50,End of Route 66,"We finished our month-long US coast to coast trip here.. and the end of the Route 66 trail. Emotional! It is really fun-looking place with a arcade from the 30s, giant Ferris wheel and fantastic views of the bay and the mountains. Wooden pier is always full with people walking here, making memories and finishing at the end of the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MildaLeo
40,It’s ok,"The pier has lots of food, kitchen, shopping and live entertainment options. The actual “theme park” is overpriced and very small. It’s a great place to spend a couple of hours, but not much more than that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/348emilyl
40,Interesting and Famous Place to Visit!,"We found a parking spot near the pier, but the parking sign was like a clown had designed it. It had four different ""exceptions"". After spending 15 minutes trying to figure it out, we finally went in and asked at a restaurant if it was OK to park there. They said yes, I explained the signs, and they thought the last exception had to do with construction which was over for that day. We decided to take the chance and walked back to the Pier.It was pretty interesting with all the shops and restaurants and tourist traps along the pier. We spent about an hour there, took photos; We bought 10 postcards for $1.10us and a Route 66 T-shirt for $9us plus tax = $10usd. Route 66 ends at Santa Monica.This is also where the Pacific Highway, #1 begins, and that’s what we took when we left to go North. This helped to explain why we were continually directed (by GoogleMaps) to the interstate, on our way down the coast, to San Diego.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryReg
50,Fun and Sun,Great place to buy souvenirs. The rides were fun... beach was wonderful and the people were friendly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deniseratcliff
40,A Favorite,"This was one of the favorite places we visited on our week long vacation in LA. It was Sunday, and you would not know. We even got lucky and were able to see a sea lion off the edge of the pier who seemed to be performing for everyone watching him. The kids wanted to do the rides, but it was really pricey. We did a bike rental for 1 hour, and it was a very nice ride. The beach is not one of the cleanest we visited, but we loved the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryanbeckyj
50,It was cloudy but still fun,Had a blast visiting the Pier. Rode the roller coaster and big wheel. Great views and we saw dolphins frolicking at the end of Pier,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roach0629
50,Great fun,"Great fun, lots to do and plenty of food on and just off the Pier. Full of life everywhere along the pier. Definitely needs to be done and the box ticked if anywhere near Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidjwgl1878
30,Now as a crotchety old man it has lost its appeal,"If you like crowds and noise in a beautiful setting the pier is for you. It has become so much busier over the past decade or so. Besides the souvenir shops and food stores, there are a number of carts selling junky trinkets or amplified music selling cds.We brought family members for their first visit and I just wanted to stand against the rail and watch the waves making their way to the beautiful beach . It was so busy and loud I couldn't hear the waves. This area is longer of interest for me, but I can imagine for most people there still is that appeal to get a selfie with a portion of the roller coaster in the background.No matter what, it still is a gorgeous beach !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skwiki
50,crowded but fun,"We were there on Friday around lunch time in the beginning of May. It was crowded, but we had fun there watching different activities and listening to music. There were plenty of seats where we could sit and enjoy the view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Irishka60645
50,Great time,Small park venue over the water with exciting rides. Did it as part of the GO LA pass. Parking was $14.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnaM1002
40,Typical Touristy destination,"For families with kids is a great destination , for couples/ solo just an hour or so is sufficient.Walking distance from Downtown Metro Station, has few food outlets offering average food, Tshirt and sports gear, some street music and includes the Pacific amusement park.Has a nice restaurant at the end of pier but the weather was stormy the day I visited but Im sure that venue would be a great venue to spend a couple of hours.Parking is available onsite adjacent to Pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sonalik736
50,Great pier experience,"Great day on the pier met friends from orange county here and had lunch followed by all the pier had to offer rides, games,music, souvenirs outstanding views of santa monica had a great day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimmy150
40,Visited as in the area,Visited the famous pier at the end of route 66 as in the area for a guided tour.It's a famous pleasure pier and slot machine arcade. Good views up the coastline to Malibu and venice. Not much else apart from restaurant and bars. Ticked off to do list but probably not visit again,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ivess3
40,Very photogenic!,"Went to the pier in the early evening, and had a great time. Very crowded with not too much walkway space, but they are trying to squeeze a whole amusement park on a pier after all! We went right to the Ferris Wheel which was a great experience - gave you lots of time up top for photos and views. We then went into the arcade and had a blast from the past - I headed to Skee Ball, boyfriend went to the shoot 'em up video games, son hit the pinball machines - we all had a ball! As the sun went down we went out on the beach and got some amazing sunset photos which we loved. Would certainly come back again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worleybird98
10,Rude staff!!!,"Don’t bother. It’s a waste of time and money, with only a few very average rides. Whatever you do, don’t take a photo as you get thrown off the ride by some rude teenage worker! Won’t be recommending to friends and family",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Poodleparlour
50,Fun place,Fun place to visit. Have visited there several times. Reminds me of “the good ole days.” A place for all ages. The younger children enjoyed the interactive aquarium. Will definitely return.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brlturner3
30,Bit of a disappointment,"Had friends visiting from New Zealand so we took them to the pier. Honestly, there just wasn't anything terribly interesting.The shops all have the same junk and the carts seem to be manned by derilicts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mirandalou
30,Past its use by date,Fun to visit and great viewsShops need sprucing up and some more fun things to buy! Worth the visit if in the area,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/673ritam
40,Fun place,Walked after dinner to the Santa Monica pier and it was a wonderful experience. It was after dinner and from the distance you could see the lights of the rides in the pier. Fun to watch at all the colorful designs produced by the lights on the ferries wheel in the distanceI think in Southern California it’s a fun thing to do,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ikemx
50,"People, food, music, dogs, what more could you ask for?","My wife and I really enjoyed our visit here. There was so much to see and hear. There was great music right up the end. Rides if thats your thing and plenty of food to choose from. PLus we met a very large mastiff dog there who was very friendly.Just watch out for the guys offering ""free"" music CDs",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeteSheringham
50,Great people watching!,"Entertaining street performers, food/snacks, even into late nights! Great access to the beach from the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ruiz5anthem
40,We loved it but there isn't much to do before 11,"We go there early and the rides don't open until 11. But it was fun and I've driven by when on business years ago.Wanted to see it up close. The street music is excellent. Park on the pier. The lots are $15 but if you drive on the pier and park there ist's much cheaper. The gift shops were tacky, as we expected, but my husband got a shirt at Bubba Gump on clearence. We had fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorettal2014
50,Something for Just About Everyone,"Everything you need for a fun day at the beach is here; food, drinks, beautiful clean beach, carnival games and rides, vendors, and a great place to watch a sunset. Santa Monica Pier has them all. We had a very good time here playing on the beach and enjoying all that the pier has to offer. There are a few grifters and beggars, but you have to take the bad with the good.This was one of the better places we found to enjoy the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillK427
40,Good views,"We stopped by the pier on a weekday morning before heading out of LA. While it was windy and therefore a bit chilly there were still folks out sunbathing and enjoying the beach. It was a sunny day so the sand was warm but the water was still cold. The pier had lots of activities going on and what seemed like a lot of visitors for a weekday morning in May. There was at least one school group amongst the visitors. There were a variety of entertainment, shopping and eating options along the pier. We parked on the pier for $3 an hour which worked for us as we were not staying long. The best thing about this area is the views of the beach with the mountains in the background.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tarheeltraveler4509
20,Low End Crowded Carnival Walk,This will be a crowded place with various low end vendors and unremarkable food. Add this to all the homeless laying around in the park and it’s not a very good experience. One public restroom about 200 yards from the pier entrance. Expect a line. Worth about a 30 minute walk just to see the people. If you have a choice I’d pass on this. Looks like a better experience than it really is.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SigEpGov
50,"Great attraction, nice clean sand beach,",I love this place for a nice walk listening to the sea and also the great attractions and food. Me and my girl love the big wheel. I love the ice cream ;-),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DerbyPhilip
30,Fantastic on a sunny day,"Nice place for fooling around, with good food, souvenirs and a fabulous view of the Santa Monica Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ccristalli
40,Beachside fun,The beach is amazing and the view from the end of the pier is excellent. It is worth the whole walk. Lots of taxi bikes to go along the walkway. Very family orientated. Lots of people practicing the trapeze on the original muscle beach. Good rides for kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vennessag2019
30,People watching at its best!,"My husband and I were greatly amused as we walked along the pier and watched the performers, the artists, and musicians. My favorite was the group that held a dance off. Be sure to take your picture under the ""official End of Rt. 66"" sign as well!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melaney68
50,That seaside feeling!,"Only had a quick stop here but it was just adorable. The pier is quite long but the walk up and down it is just lovely. The beach I really clean and nice and you can take some really amazing photos all the way along. I felt like I was back at a typical seaside resort when I was there, and felt like a little kid again. It was really nice and I’d recommend paying it a visit even if you only have a few hours or half a day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichelleByrne79
40,"Always nice, over the top but amusing","As end of the famous Route 66, always nice to visit the Pier again. One big tourist carnaval, but if you look at the end into the water, you might see some seals. It is fun to watch all the people from all over the world and get a reflection of yourself standing on the Pier. We always do it by bike, which gives an extra dimension. Really recommendable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ariee422
40,Lovely pier with lots to do,"If you like the seaside then you'll love this pier. With attractions such as the fair rides, street performers, and snippets of history dotted around, it is definitely worth a visit.Plenty of restaurants and gift ships so satisfy everyone's needs and wants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fibarn
20,Tourist trap,Not much to see and not much to do... It's full of stands with nothing substantial to them. You can buy these same items cheaper along venice beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/909remit
30,Not exceptional,"Rather overrated, worth a short visit. Nothing memorable except that it is a historical (for West Coast standards) place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Passenger1956
50,Fun,"Loved the pier, busy but lots of fun. We spent a lot but that’s kids for you lol. The views are fab too, it was a beautiful sunny day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel597533
50,Nice and iconic,"We wanted to go as we saw this place a few times in the Netflix Lucifer series. Parking was a bit expensive. We had a nice walk on the pier and the little history pictures at the end of the pier was interesting. We had a lot of fun with the little rollercoaster. We had the Go Los Angeles Pass, so this was included at no extra cost. Doing this at night was magical.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kwi_kwa_ju
50,Fun Pier,"This pier is bustling with activity, there is lots to see and do as well as places to eat and drink. I would recommend visiting!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deank06
30,Santa Monica Pier,"This was my first time visiting Santa Monica Pier so I don't know what I expected but I was a little disappointed. The area, I found was run down and we had to walk by a group of people hanging around at the top of the hill leading down to the pier who had a donation box for pot sitting out for people to drop money in. We walked by several people who were high on one thing or another. They were not really bothering anyone but it was just different and not what I am used to.The pier itself was fun and I enjoyed the live entertainment and shops although the shops were expensive but that wasn't surprising. The ferris wheel was my favorite and it offered an incredible view. I didn't find it overly crowded but we were there fairly early. We walked around a bit to all the different shops in town but didn't find enough to keep us busy for an entire day.Overall, it was fun for the time we were there but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back. One time is enough for me and I would recommend visiting for anyone who is in the area. There aren't many places like that around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/busytraveler271
30,A little touristy,"Ok, but very small and a little touristy. Only about a dozen shops and restaurants combined. Nice place to people watch and kill time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/736juliep
30,Nice Place,"Santa Monica Pier is located at short distance walking from our Hotel, so we took the stroll... Don’t be shocked by the number of homeless “living” (or trying to survive) along the Promenade to the Pier... The Pier itself is ok, featuring some street artists, a lot of animations, restaurants, shops... it’s ok... We have seen it ONCE, are happy to have seen it - but THAT’S IT...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stoffel1953
50,Santa monica pier,"Fun fun fun even with the crowds. Great atmosphere, great sunshine and a super beach. A sea lion even came to greet us at the end of the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarah26759
40,Nice but too many people for me,Beautiful place with lots to do and see but just way too many people. Give yourself an extra hour or 2.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KyT27
30,Nice little pier,"Rather crowded with lots of people in the pier. It does provide some good views of the beach and it's fun watching the fisher people try their luck. Usual assortment of tacky shops and third rate restaurants .In the world their are some monster piers, amusement parks that are breathtakingly beautifulSMP is nice enough from a local perspective but I would not go out of my way to visit. But if your a local it's a pleasant place for a jog or stoll",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Auscoach
30,Tourist Area,I just walked the pier and did not do any of the rides. It was crowded. The beach had swimmers and families enjoying the day. It was ok.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/afiggy
40,Surprised,"I have always avoided the Pier but while on a beach run we decided to run to the end of the Pier. It reminded me of going down the shore as a kid, The shops are just as you would want and expect, selling beachy tourist stuff but it's always fun to look around. There are a few places to eat and hear live music, and there was even YOGA at the end of the Pier, a free, fun way to unwind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/99nancym
10,If you like tacky things,"Good Lord this was like a county Fair. We drove into the parking lot and my 12 year old son said, oh please Dad can't we just leave? Nothing but chain food places and trinkets for tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FamilyMan1963
50,Very interesting place to walk around,"Interesting shops, of course the long wooden boardwalk, the sign for the end of Route 66, the views of the ocean and the shoreline all make this a great experience. Park free at one of the Red Structures for 1.5 hours, some of which are on 2nd Street I believe. I parked in Red Structure 6. Then it is only like a 3 block walk to the bridge leading to the Santa Monica Pier",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomasbR6194LQ
30,It’s ok :-),"If you are there you WILL go there but ...pretty small, few food spots and stores.We spotted some sea lions .A little crowded - on a chili day (imagine in the summer).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tapeterlee2015
50,Lively and lovely,Santa Monica Pier is a must see when in LA. The area was lively on the day we visited and only a short Uber from Hollywood. Experience the sights and sounds of the long beach and take a walk down to Venice Beach which is eclectic.Also check out the Zoltar machine if you remember the Tom Hanks film ‘Big’.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evo_321
40,"It's a must visit, but nothing great","It is something you have to see, but don't expect more than an experience. There are rides and a trapeze place. There are a few restaurants as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingBbusFun
30,Ok but pay attention to ur security,The place is very busy and it’s generally safe and the immediate area around on the beach but don’t go towards Venice beach area it’s very unsafeThe food is nice and lots of option,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bcamron
40,Fun for everyone. Great for a stroll and look around or for the rides if you are into that,"Great for a stroll and look around or for the rides if you are into that. Good for families or couples, Lots of options for food of all types. Many games and rides to go on or play. Some interesting facts listed. Quite a few shops for souvenirs. Lovely at night with the lighting and rides lit up. Very good spot to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarinnaCraig
20,Tears for Piers,"Apart from being at the end of Route 66, I’m not sure why you’d want to visit. The view is good if fleeting. Everything else is more or less what you’d expect. Kids would enjoy it more than adults I suspect.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noeli339
40,The famous Santa Monica Pier,This famous Santa Monica Pier attracts thousands of people almost every day.Lot`s of shops and restaurants.In general we had a good experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteliosP700
40,Wonderful around sunset,First time to see the pier and it was just beautiful in the early evening. The ocean breeze and people watching was worth the visit. The views of the pacific and coastline were stunning.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gregpauig
30,Kitchy LA Fun,"Pack your wallet and your sunscreen. The pier is one of the kitchiest spots in LA, but worth the visit, especially for tourists seeking the quintessential LA tourist trap. The rides are fun (buy online for a discount and just get the pass), show up at early to avoid the crazy afternoon crowds, skip the overpriced fried food options and head up into Santa Monica for hundreds of good eats at any price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeauSidwell

50,Lots of fun!,It was my first time in LA. Me and a co-worker took Uber to Santa Monica Pier.

You can spend the whole day here because there is so much you can do.Highly recommended!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yaasir

30,"Nothing Exciting, but Great Views","It’s nothing spectacular, but it’s a great view of the Pacific Ocean. It’s also one of those things you just have to do if you’re in the area. There are a few rides and a little food, the best being the cart where a gentleman cuts up fruits with lime an chilé! I guess I had really high expectations and I just didn’t find it very exciting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/462deannab
40,Really Nice to See!,"We loved wandering along Santa Monica Pier! We went as far out as it would go and a seal (or a sealion) was swimming about right in front of us!

40,Historical Fun,Everyone knows of the infamous Santa Monica Pier. I really enjoyed walking around and observing the people. So much to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Juliathemother
50,Great place to walk around with a view of the Pacific Ocean,"I visited the Santa Monica Pier in April 2019. The first challenge is to find parking. I decided to park in a parking lot which costs $14 for the day. It was easier to find parking there as I had to drive around first and did not find anything. From this parking lot, you can walk on a walking path near the beach for about 5-10 minutes straight to the Santa Monica Pier. The view of the Ferris Wheel, the rides and the pier is awesome. Once on the pier, there is a lot of activity, restaurants, shops and it is very crowded with people. The view of the beach and the Pacific Ocean is really nice. There is a sign of Route 66 because Route 66 ends at Santa Monica Pier (and begins in Chicago). All of these are photo opportunities. I really enjoyed my visit to Santa Monica Pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blairkk25

30,First Time Visit- It was an Okay Place,"My first time visiting the pier and it was very crowded. Parking was not convenient, but that was expected for such a popular place. My children enjoyed the rides and the food we ate was okay. The scenery was nice and we were able to get some good pictures. Overall, I’m glad I went, but it’s not something I need to see again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RaymondB894
50,Lovely stroll along the pier and beach.,Super beach and pier with extensive restaurants and amusements from a big wheel to fortune tellers. You could actually spend the day people watching.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Escape24379429871
50,Loved it!,I’m so glad we stopped here! Awesome place to visit. Even though it was very crowded on Mothers Day we enjoyed walking around. The beach was beautiful and clean. The pier has multiple places to eat and even a few rides for kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ellen055
50,A Must Do,"Every time I’m in LA, I make a trip to the pier. We love the view of the beach and the mountains. It’s a carefree walk from one end to the other where you can stop in an old arcade, buy souvenirs, see live entertainment, let your children ride the amusement park rides, have an adult beverage, have dinner at one of the restaurants or just grab a funnel cake. I never get tired of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveToGo49
50,Fun.,"I enjoyed walking the pier. There is plenty to see, and there is a lot of people watching. It's quite crowded, so it must be fun for all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tarjana
50,A Must for Tourists,"Even if you're not big on crowds, you have to at least drop by the pier if you're from out of town. If you go early in the day it's pretty quiet and peaceful. There's fun rides, access to the beach, and affordable souvenirs! Go up a block and find a better price on sweatshirts though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunnyMolly26
30,They Call This An Amusement Park?,"I was an Everclear fan...I watched the scene where Forrest Gump ran to the pier and then turned around and went back. I had romanticized Santa Monica. But Y'all gotta come to the Jersey Shore to see what a ""real"" pier and amusement park is. This is more of a Coney Island weirdo feel than a family friendly fun time. Don't get me wrong: it was very pretty and the cliffs to the north were very picturesque. But trust me - a Jersey girl knows her stuff. This place was really disappointing and massively overrated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tcooper22

40,The last stop on Rte 66,"A small Atlantic City beach pier. Restaurants, street performers a Carney area and all the things you expect at the beach. Santa Monica Pier and the walkway and city are steps away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrLeeL
40,Peoplewatching paradise,"As visitors in LA we had trouble finding the right entrance to the parking lot. Finally we made it and paid the 14 dollar fee for dayparking.The beach is huge, clean, beautiful and filled with interesting people. The view of the beach from the pier is wonderful.The pier itself is lined with souvenir shops, restaurants and also a few talented street musicians.There’s also an amusement park on the pier which looked kinda sad. It felt as if this is where all old rides go to retire.Some goes for the arcade hall. It was jam-packed with arcade games most of which were past their glory days. Kids seemed to enjoy it though.There are restrooms on the pier but I don’t recommend using the one down by the parking lot. It was filthy.All the above things - both good and bad - make up the overall charming atmosphere of the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/176helena_
40,Very attractive at night,"We’re “oldies” who rarely take more than a couple of rides when we visit amusement parks these days. However, with its free entry and wide range of food options, the Santa Monica Pier is still a favorite. After dark, the pier lights up with a very pretty display. Worth a detour!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gregh632
40,A hangout place,"Lively place with activities. Electric atmosphere. Street activities, food counters etc. Lots of parking facilities around. Do visit in santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drpragneshmv
40,Great views!,The pier is very busy as expected. Lots of restaurants in the area with seating that allows you to take in the views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JKgirl
40,Fun and beautiful thing to do.,"We were surprised how nice the area was and how beautiful the views were. We parked on top of the cliffs and paid for meter parking at $2 per hour. The parking on the beach next to the pier is $14 per car. Plus being on top of the cliffs made it a nice walk and fantastic views. The area is very nice (versus the dumpy Venice Beach). They make the walk down to the pier pretty easy. Long grade down so it's not too steep. There is an amusement park and some food. We didn't use any of that, just visited. So, it is well worth doing when all it cost was $2 for the entire family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScottD42868
50,We love it!,"Dear friends,Have your phones charged and enjoy.This place is very lively and full of entertainment.Take a cap or a hat with you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petraalmutawa

50,Good views,It’s easy to just walk out here and enjoy the views of the water and the city. Not sure if I’d bother with any food and attractions (which often have strangely short hours) but it’s easy to ignore them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrdom
40,Iconic Pier,This is the famous and iconic Santa Monica pier and a must see in LA. The views are cool and so are the people. Food is in a food court atmosphere and can be too expensive. Would suggest eating at nearby restaurant not on the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LiketoeatCincinnati
30,"Nice beach, ok pier.","Busy pier with some rides and places to get food and drinks. There were a couple that my 8 yr old would go on, my teen wasn’t interest and found it to be too crowded. Quite a few people trying to sell you things. It was an interesting stop, and the beach looked nice, but I would not go out of my way to go here more than once. Looked to be some kind of market that was being taken down when we arrived—wish i hadn’t missed it. Maybe some kind of weekly market?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveling91012
50,Fun at the Pier,"We really enjoyed Santa Monica Pier. It has a great family feel, yet there were many couples enjoying the ocean from the benches. We didn’t ride any rides, but they sure looked fun! There are a lot of things to enjoy, plenty of food and drinks. A “must see” in Santa Monica. We were there during the day, and after dark. Beautiful lights at night! The Ferris Wheel has exceptional lighting!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tina116C
50,Good walk,"We walked along this beach from Santa Monica to Venice Beach, lots to see and spent an afternoon here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claires668
40,Nice walk close to Santa Monica,Nice walk along the pier. Easy access via bridge over the busy road. Great spot from which to take photos of the beach and Santa Monica. Rides were fun but at $10 each we only had one.A few places to eat but they all looked very touristy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EGH

30,Family weekend trip,"In LA visiting family and to site see. Came here on a Sunday afternoon, just happened to be Cinco de Mayo. Very festive atmosphere, seemed very busy, great to see coast and caught a glimpse of a sea lion. Didn't go on rides. Pier Park smelled of popcorn and urine...City needs to address the urine smell, maybe hose down in morning after they kick out homeless/bums.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellesU1730GF
40,Finally here,"Been to LA several times but never had time to get to the pier. Drove by it but never could stop. Great fun spot with lots of lights and people watching. Walked around the pier to get the full flavor of the atmosphere. Fun place with cool vibe.My husband was an extra on Seinfield back in the day and we recreated his scene on the boardwalk, so fun!!And the icing on the cake was a pic in the photobooth, lots of laughs 😎",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/boktasofplainville
30,A Little Pricey But GREAT EXPERIENCE & Something FUN TO DO!,"Expect to spend a decent amount! $50 for a unlimited ride bracelet for adults and about $17 for a toddler. In my opinion, there were not that many rides for a $50 bracelet and most of the games were $5. I rode some of the kiddie rides with my toddler to try and get my moneys worth. It is a unique experience just expect to spend a bit. Boardwalk had exciting things going on from people and vendors - bring your camera because it is vibrantly colored and visually stunning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenniferLeeSKG
50,Beautiful area,Santa Monica pier was a great place to visit with the end of Route 66 sign on the pier. Overlooking the famous beach where bay watch was filmed . The famous film Forrest Gump was filmed on the pier with bubba gump shrimp factory with a souvenir shop to get all your souvenirs from the film . A beautiful area and very lively with different places to eat . A must see if in Santa Monica area .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TopFlightHotels
40,Very busy & well policed,"A fun place to visit with numerous restaurants & a small amount of rides (Pacific Park). Extremely popular and constantly very crowded, numerous 'street' acts along the pier entertain (in some cases I use that term loosely) as well. Great fun and enjoyment for all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steppin-owt
10,Unpleasant employee at Merry-Go-Round,"My friend and I made our regular visit to the Merry-Go-Ground, but an employee said I was too fat to ride...though I actually weigh under the 200 pound limit and even offered to get on scales to let her see the fact. I am a local and ride the Merry-Go-Round a few times a year....and have done so for decades. I was embarrassed and insulted. But they did refund my admission fare.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimJxxx
40,A cool spot,"This is a cool place to visit - the pier is interesting to have a look around, there’s some arcade games and places to have a bite to eat. Well worth seeing and beautiful views of the ocean",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kated362
50,Amazing Place...,Loved Santa Monica and walking the pier and all the restaurants. The promenade shopping district was awesome. Will be going back. The street performers were fun and the rides are great for the kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KristenK1969
30,A must for the tourist,Typical of such places kitch but a must for those new tourists travelling to Santa Monica / gorgeous view at night and extremely visible by day- Busy during the day but fun for the kids - 1 visit probably enough,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suzannealison
50,Must visit when in west coast,"Got a time out on weekend to visit Santa Monica pier , It was beautiful beach side with eateries and fun. Wonderful setup along the city with blue sea and western coast highway drive. Will visit again with family when time permits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RSARAN9

40,Family fun,We took our grandkids for a day at the pier and beach. It was fun with something for everyone. We arrived early to be able to park on the pier. It’s fun to people watch while the kids ride the rides. Several good places to eat on the pier. You can also hit the beach or rent bikes to ride.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daler225
40,Bike riding and roller blading,Santa Monica pier is always a starting point to bike ride or rollerblade on the beach. This is my favorite area of Los Angeles. I like to take bike rides from this area to Venice Beach and back. Our street promenade is not too far where you can grab a bite to eat. And the beach is right at your fingertips. Love it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnnyboydc
30,"Over rated, cold and very busy","I was really looking forward to seeing Santa Monica Pier, but I came away from our visit a little underwhelmed.Don't get me wrong, it was nice, but I certainly wouldn't rush back there again.Maybe the weather ruined it for us, as it was a bitterly cold day (at the end of April still?) with high winds, so that wasn't very pleasant at all.If you have little kids this would be a good place for you, as the rides are really suitable for young children, but as an older couple it wasn't really targeted to us.Nonetheless, it was nice to look around the pier and see the beach. The retail vendors were very good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathymL9202IC
50,Fun experience,Must visit if you're in the area. Fun for the whole family. Great entertainment. Beautiful scenery. Many places to eat. Several shopping venues.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/433erniem
40,Cute place,"Fun place for almost all age groups. End point of route 66, the pier, restaurants, beach, souvenir shops, the views of LA, good fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/568mansik
50,Love this view!,"We stayed in Santa Monica and checked out the Pier and Venice Beach, which is walking distance. Loved all the vintage and surf shops and walking on the beach. Lots of surfing and just really neat to be there when it is the background of so many famous movies. Just beautiful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ati1984
40,The End of Route 66 is A Tourist Heaven,I don't know too many locals that go to the Santa Monica Pier but I can see it from my new condo which is kinda nice. My 7 year old loves the rides but what seven year old doesn't. It gets VERY crowded in the summer as it is loaded with tourists. The fact that the local train ends right there too now doesn't help with the crowds. Food options aren't that good on the pier but you don't have to walk to far to find great stuff in Santa Monica. Ivy by the Shore being one of the best around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FlyersFanInLA
30,Amazing views but expensive!,"Terribly overpriced, Ferris wheel ride is $10 for example. Views are amazing so it is worth a walk along.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erinmurfitt
50,Lots to see,"Lots to see, local flavor, entertainers, eats, fun for kids, shopping. Walking alongside the pier , or on the pathway alongside the road, overlooking the pier, is a nice walk and view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cuao34
50,Fun day with family!,"I grew up going to the pier and my children now enjoy it! It's always a special place where we celebrate birthdays and many occasions. We have also had my daughter's 10th birthday party here, very memorable and fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vacationer703731
50,Fun place to visit and must do if in town,We stayed a few blocks away from the pier and did venture over for an afternoon. Fun place to visit and people watch. great performers to watch as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dton93
30,"Nice, But Pricey","Great old pier, places to eat and the usual pier attractions (arcade, places to eat etc)You can rent fishing equipment if you fancy doing a bit of fishing. The eateries were very over priced but the quality was ok, some of the entertainment was a little weird, buy hey, this is California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkG748
50,Great place to play and eat,"Great place to play and eat, we walked along to Venice Beach (muscle beach) too and had a fantastic time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rayuk81
50,Finally visited Dell Perro Pier of GTA V !!,My first reaction was 'wow they made it so real in GTA'.The pier itself is ok. It could get smelly as some people love fishing there.The rollercoaster ride lasted may be less than a minute! Hot Dogs were super expensive here.Took some photos from various angles and then went to the shores to watch the sunset.Overall it was a nice visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/akhilpwalia
30,Ok Pier,"We visited whilst on vacation in June. Plenty of parking on the pier to the sides of the pier near the beach. It was a busy Friday afternoon some good amusements on the pier and shops and restaurants. Route 66 sign great for photos the rides on the pier massively over priced at 10 dollars each for the rollercoaster and Feris Wheel we went on rollercoaster at a cost of 3p dollars fab views but expensive.Views up the coast fantastic from pier but be aware , at top of pier lots of people hanging about trying to get money . They saw we were British Tourists and followed us down the pier had I not stopped and noticed them I think they would have mugged us lucky it was busy and I spotted them .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeanS138
40,Crazy Busy!,Every time we visit Santa Monica we love walking the Pier. It’s become so crowded you end up doing a shuffle instead. Ate lunch at The Albright and had yummy lobster rolls. Lots of souvenir stands on the Pier if that’s your thing. Ferris Wheel is always amazing too. Sunsets from here are usually fabulous!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JCzapski
40,LA,"A hazy day and for an early Friday morning there were still a few hundred people on the pier. The solar powered Ferris Wheel is a landmark. The pier has appeared in many movies and shows. The guide said they can get up to 30,000 on the pier but I think that’s a stretch",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnandMichelle87
40,Something for everyone,"There is a little something for everyone at the Santa Monica Pier. From unique restaurants to a ferris wheel to a beautiful beach, there's almost certainly something for you to enjoy.I recommend Bubba Gump Shrimp. However, there is generally a wait so it's best to sign up for a reservation right when you get there, and then spend a little time on the pier while you wait for your table.There is also parking located right next to the boardwalk, but it is $30 for an all day pass. It's a little pricey, but it will save you some walking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FootTrafficTravelers
40,Nice place,We have been there for just couple of hours. The pier is pretty large and has enough charm to visit. On the other side it is too noisy and very busy. Many people try to sell him/herself there which can be a bit disturbing...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gyorgy_KGYK
50,Sunny,"A happy sunny place to be, come to feel that cool and nice Californian vibe, walk the beach, hear the ocean crumble in waves before you",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kingosp
40,Santa Monica Pier,We got there early and most wasn’t open yet. However we had a great morning adult beverage at Bubba Gumps with breakfast. Parking was $14 cash only but it was for all day. We enjoyed seeing it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/349sherris
40,Great place to go by the sunset time,"I really enjoyed visiting this place, the only bad thing is that the parking is expensive and there are so many street vendors, I recomend wearing a coat if you get there by 5 pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maferecomienda
50,Santa Monica visit,"Busy area lots of people about,plenty of fast food outlets the iconic ferris wheel,could have spent all day there but we were on a tour and only got to stay 90 minutes, really enjoyed visit would highly recommend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F3862LKmichaeld
40,"Lots to do, but can be pricey.","Came on a sunny day with strong 40+ mph winds. Still very busy. Parking was ample though just a few blocks away from the Pier. We spent a couple of hours here as we had some time to kill before flying out of LAX. We mostly window shopped but did choose to ride the main roller coaster. It was short, not that exciting and $10 each! Not worth it. They had carnival games as well, but too expensive for the dinky toys you could win. Still an iconic place with great views and plenty to do if you want to spend some money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelmW1446UM
30,Fun to see the ocean,"Some attractions include Ferris wheel, and other carnival like entertainment located in a great place close to many lovely hotels and attractions . On the Santa Monica beach with lots of life guards and pretty safe .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/opal_unicorn
40,We love some pier,"It's a must do when you're from out of town and it never fails to provide exactly what is expected. Only thing Im not keen on is that the some of the street entertainers are on the sketchy side. You'd think they'd be better at policing these after all this time. It's a great place to hang out for a hour or two though, just don't expect any gourmet food close by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnPagani
40,Nice beach in LA!,"Great place for families, friends and couples. There are also many restaurants nearby. Plus plenty of parking lots for visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pycpy

50,Surprisingly Fun!!!,"My family of 4 came by here after taking the Hop On Hop Off bus tour planning on only spending a couple of hours but ended up spending most of the day. There was so many fun things to do with kids that we decided to spend more time here than originally planned. Between riding the Ferris Wheel, renting bikes to go down to Venice Beach and playing on the beach there are many things to do. And to top it off there are amazing views of the beach with mountain ranges that make for awesome photo ops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jesselodge
10,Gone downhill,We took a taxi to Santa Monica pier and walked down to Venice late on a Wednesday afternoon. It is not how I remembered it many years ago -as we walked the pathway down it felt quite unsafe and very dirty . I am unsure whether the legalisation of marijuana for adults in 2016 is a contributing factor but we did honestly feel on edge at times not a place to bring young children and couldn’t wait to get back in a taxi - what a shame and the hotels in this area I imagine are suffering as a result,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickandRaff
40,Fun and delightful view,Enjoyed the pier although pretty crowded. Beware of aggressive solicitors though-My biggest complaint.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LLMHerb
50,Just like the old days.,This place brings me back to my days on the boardwalk back home . All the attractions overlooking the seaside . We walked from the pier to the fishing peir in Venice beach. The fun and excitement of the rides are memorable to my youth .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClassicCouple
40,Great summer getaway,"If you want to escape the summer heat in the L.A. area and don't mind fighting traffic driving to the beach, the Santa Monica Pier is a great choice for couples on a date, families with kids, and young adults who want a place to hang out. Rides on the pier are of the typical amusement park variety (carnival rides), but the roller coaster is awesome for such a small park. If you go on only one ride because you don't want to ""break the bank"" on a park ride wristband, go on the roller coaster. Pier food and rides are expensive, so plan on spending a lot of money if you have a family or plan on going on rides and eating a lot of food. Parking is iffy and not cheap, especially on the weekends. It's better to park in a Santa Monica city lot and walk a few blocks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJCrawford
50,great way to end the day,"been here plenty of times and always take first timers here. Also a good spot to come late afternoon before head back home on flights as short drive to airport. Great people watching spot and end of route 66, apart from the rides and places to eat always buskers and entertainment going on but very busy make sure you head off the pier and go for a walk along the beach foot path. Another great place to people watch or see beach volleyball, acrobats",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/greigc2015

20,"I’ve seen it, I don’t need to again",This was my first trip to Santa Monica. We walked over to the pier in the early morning and walked along past the performers and gift shops to the end for a view of the ocean. And then we left and didn’t need to go back. It’s nice to see for the bucket list but I don’t feel like I need to go again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rhyannonb2018
20,Overrated,"This place is definitely overrated. Regular amusement park, with shops. Dirty looking, overcrowded, nothing special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/729lenkas
50,Allow several hours...,"A happy, fun and exciting place with SO much to see. We completely underestimated how long we needed to really experience it all. My advice is to allow several hours. The views and atmosphere are like nothing else we have seen. We plan to return and stay in Santa Monica. This is a must do experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FamilynFun

50,A must visit!,"Santa Monica and the Pier is a must see on your trip to LA. It is very clean and has lots to do and see.The pier is pretty big and boats lots of great views and photo opportunities. There is a small theme park with around 10 rides and a selection of games. We had unlimited ride access due to our ‘LA Go Passes’ which was great! Fun for all adults & children! Especially loved the Ferris wheel as we got loads of great photos and was able to overlook Santa Monica beach!The pier has lots of eateries, food & drink outlets, souvenir stands, street performers and shops. There are accessible toilets and changing facilities available.A lovely walk around, with people fishing at the bottom of the pier. Would highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LJBanny
50,Iconic,"Iconic! It was clean, the locals are very friendly and very helpful. The rides were definitely pricey, but it was all apart of the experience. However, you won’t spend all day here. I would suggest renting bikes to go down to Venice and come back at night for the rides!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WhereIsAshley
40,LA beach trip,"Very cute old pier with theme park rides, little shops and places to ear. Nice for a day out and suitable for families. Lots of restrooms and nearby parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/55connie
40,Why Do You Go? Because It's There!,"As we walked down Santa Monica Pier I kept having this weird vibe that I had been there before. Then I realized it's because in our travels, especially to ocean and beach towns throughout the country and world, we've experienced many of the same things Santa Monica Pier offers. While the amusement park is somewhat unique the main draw is that many of us recognize it from TV shows and movies. There are numerous eating establishments and of course the ever present street (pier) performers trying to make a buck. Perhaps the most iconic feature of Santa Monica Pier is the sign marking the end the famous Route 66. It's almost requisite to have your picture taken there especially if you've been to the beginning of Route 66 in Chicago. The pier is nice for people watching and strolling and of course there are So. Cal souvenirs sold along the way. Parking on the pier is available as well as a number of lots along the expansive beach, but we were there in April so I imagine it can get very crowded in the summer months. If so inclined, bike & scooter rentals are also available before you actually get up onto the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaptainNalga
50,Very cool and iconic,"Visited last year as the pier is famous for many things but it’s iconic to kids from the grand theft auto game.It’s so much more than that, lots of cool shops, bars and restaurants",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harvey-family-Travel

Good pictures and nice sunsets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dreamer827012
20,Overpriced and dated,There is a balance on charging an expensive price and ripping people off.The price for games and rides are extortionate. Like a british fun fair in terms of the rip off games....The only value is the carousel which is only 2 bucks a ride and kids loved.Someone needs to control the prices on this pier...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/244marcm

20,Busy & touristy,Over crowded people walking in every direction...hard to get through. Nice scenery but not worth the hype. Lots of people selling churros up and down the pier. Kind of annoying are also the people teying to hand you bracelets. Not good for strollers or small kids I would be careful to watch purses as well. I was happy I went ro say I did but would not go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gypsygirl31
50,Scenic and Iconic,The first sight of the sign for the pier will have you reaching for your camera. Really cool to see in person. If you go on the weekend don’t be in a hurry because it gets crowded. Worth the walk which is lined with lots of street performers that are fun to watch. After you hit the pier and check out the Promenade shops where you will see lots more street performers. Both great places to people watch and shop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lesl469

10,faded glory,faded glory. A too messy and cattle place. People are just walking here and drinking a d eating fast food. No this is not a nice place and much to crowded. It has lost all his original glamour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JankeesR
50,Historic pier,"Fantastic feature of Santa Monica is the pier. The pier has all the usual suspects. Hawkers selling t shirts, sunglasses and hats then there are artists drawing, painting and even a few guys making clay models of your face . All very entertaining. The end of the pier has great views across the bay and back to shore . The funfair was very busy everyone looked like they were having fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JocktheArab
30,Fun but crowded,"We have 12 and 14 year old daughters. They enjoyed the pier, rode the Ferris wheel which is $10 a ride. Worth seeing but do not need to spend much time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SonyaS936
50,Santa Monica Pier & End of Route 66,"The famous and infamous Santa Monica Pier is an L.A. landmark. Since opening in 1906, travelers from all over come to see the trademark ferris wheel that sits over the pier. But the Santa Monica Pier is also recognizable from its numerous movie appearances.This instantly-nostalgic structure served as a backdrop for a number of Hollywood movies over the years such as Forrest Gump and Iron Man.With a carousel, an arcade, an amusement park, restaurants,the Santa Monica Pier offers a wide range of activities for the whole family.A sign at the end of the Santa Monica Pier marks the end of the legendary American highway Route 66, symbolizing that this road only ended when the sea stood in its way.*Tip; This provides a great photo opportunity for the traveler.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryM874
50,Great amount of stuff to do.,"Great for ocean, pier, people watching, events, shops, musicians, many restaurants have on pier and off pier. Outstanding!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/653tomt
20,Going down hill,"We were here a couple of years ago and enjoyed seeing the street performers on the pier so we were looking forward to going back when we were back in town this month. We took a hop on hop off bus tour and so we got dropped off across rhe street and walked through the little park in front of the boardwalk. It was about noon time and very busy. Still, the park was scary. There were a lot of homeless people camped out. When we left there were guys fighting and screaming at each other yelling some pretty vulgar things. The boardwalk was packed and that is fine, but there were two performers who I would consider inappropriate for kids. There were some others too who were fine and pretty good. We did have lunch at the restaurant at the end of the pier and it was expensive but good. The views are still wonderful and the beach looks nice. I would not consider this a family friendly atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/857jillk
50,Iconic site to visit,"Has to be a must do on any list when visiting Los Angeles. We parked underneath and parking fees were reasonable for that area. Great to walk around, lots of activity and people on the boardwalk and pier! Definitely recommend a ride on the rollercoaster also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ciara736
50,"So chiche, I know . But cannot beat that sunset!","Another notch off the tourist checklist:) I guess it may get old for locals, but such an iconic pier. Obviously visited in time to catch the setting sun and the lighting was beautiful. Something so nostalgic about this place...it just harkens back to another time, a taste of summer for a northern visitor. I didn't realize it was the end of the famous Route 66. Lots of opportunity for some really pretty photos and some great memories. This from a magical mother/sons vacation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kweenbee7
40,Fun experience,Very pleasant experience at the pier. Right off the beach with several ways to access the pier. A little too many independent vendors who were in your personal space but still a good time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/691natalief
40,Fun Time,"Went down to the pier for one night and had fun with the kids. Bucket list type thing to do. Pretty expensive paying $10 to ride the Ferris wheel or roller coaster, but I guess you have to do it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C0llinsW
50,Fun for all!,"Fun in the sun, toes in the sand, seagulls gawking above you and the spinning ferris wheel. Plenty of paid parking at the beach or nearby. Beautiful beaches all around, yummy food to eat and plenty to see and do!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jessbefree
40,Great beachside fun,"We stumbled upon this spot unintentionally and had a great evening. They have fair and arcade games, fair food, rides, and entertainment. Food was outrageously expensive and it took me 30 minutes to get a funnel cake- LOL, service sucked. Regardless, it was great beachside entertained and would recommend checking it out!Added plus: incredible sunsets!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HollyNichole
30,Crowded and a lot of homeless people,Visiting San Monica pier as part of a bus tour of LA and only had an hour to enjoy. It was pretty. The homelessness took away from the fun. Any shaded area was claimed by the homeless and their stuff. Limited time so didn’t have time for more than a short walk and lunch. Lots of food trucks but no place to eat. Lots of dogs too. Glad I got to see it once. Great placesto eat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosebud001
50,Pier,Fun and relaxing . Friendly people. Good restaurants around . The views are really good. The arcades are good for all ages. Few rides to kill time . Watching the sunset is amazing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amermourad
50,Fun day at Santa Monica Pier,We found a parking garage within close walking distance to the pier. We grabbed lunch at Big Deans which was an inexpensive and delicious choice. We all enjoyed the carnival games and the Ferris wheel. Great views and photo opp. We saw dolphins swimming. The beach is gorgeous and the sand is so soft.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FunFoodFamilyFab5
50,A must,This was our 2nd visit here and it's our favorite thing to do in Santa Monica. The beach wasn't too packed the vibe is relaxing. There was something always going on every time we were there as far as entertainment different singers and dancing. Of course there's the rides and restaurants as well. We will continue to come back!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vindes
10,"Plastic, fake and cheap (not in a monetary sense)","Wherever there is a fake Emo impersonator questions should be asked. Cheap, busy and like Blackpool (UK reference) on steroidsFood expensive, attractions old and performs average",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theKingOfOxley
20,Sisters Birthday Getaway,Not sure what all the hype is about!Wanted to visit a beach before leaving LA and this area was recommended by several people! I found it to be dirty and over priced! Eight dollars a ride is a little expensive! And homeless people sleeping on the beach and under the pier. On a positive note had a wonderful lunch at Albright’s.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Charnj
40,"Beautiful views and busy, lively vibe on the Pier","We picked a beautiful day, with blue skies to visit the Santa Monica Pier with our 2 daughters aged 11 and 13. It was very busy with tourists and street performers. It was a really lively vibe and good fun for an hour or so. There is a fairground on the pier and so we also enjoyed some rollercoaster and rides, plus traditional fairground games and stalls. Lovely views out across the beaches on both sides of the pier. Lovely photos opportunities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tjflutterby
50,Relaxing,A nice relaxing walk and a little entertainment at Pacific Park! Totally a must see for any sight seers!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelergirl96
40,Family visit,"I have been here before pre-kids but as we had a day to burn after our cruise, we decided to spend the day at Santa Monica. It was really busy but the kids had a lot of fun. The amusment park is on the small side (but as expected as it's on a pier) and a touch expensive ($5 per ride unless you buy the unlimited wrist band). Lots to look at and just a fun atmosphere. We also stopped at Scoops for some ice cream - also expensive. It is a tourist trap but iconic and fun at the same time. A day or day and half is probably enough time to experience it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Family8travels
50,"Great visit, great location, just a tad expensive for what you get","Over priced for what you get, but a must to visit. Really warm and nice location, just chill out and enjoy what you see",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buckyCumbria
50,Great Place to Bring Visiting Out-of-State Friends & Family,"The Santa Monica Pier is a Great Place to Bring Visiting Out-of-State Friends & Family!! Most visitors have watched varies television shows and movies with scenes of the Santa Monica Pier. So, it’s on a lot of Tourists’ Bucket Lists!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karmynj2016
50,So much fun!,It was a lively and lovely spring night at the pier. So much family fun and lots of entertainment. We felt like this was a great family atmosphere with lots of rides and fair type food choices. We took an Uber from our hotel because we were about 8-9 blocks away.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ilovehellokitty3
30,"Crowded, but always space for a few more","We visited here on a Saturday afternoon and were pleasantly surprised to get parked really close to the pier for very reasonable charges. The first 90 minutes were free! The best thing for us was the sign marking the end of Route 66. Very entertaining and talented performers line the pier. Tourist shops overpriced. We’ve been once and are pleased we did it, but won’t be going back any time soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gill168
50,The Best Pier!,"We’ve visited many coastal towns large and small and The Santa Monica Pier is by far the best Pier...great Mexican lunch at the end of the Pier, along with other food options, games, shopping, street entertainment, fishing and people watching. A must spend half or more day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S3508GZcatherineg

30,"Lots of HonkyTonk, Crowds, Weird People, but A Great Ferris Wheel","You're going to encounter panhandlers, loud people, crowds, and high prices. If you must go, then get on the ferris wheel for the incredible view which stretches north to Malibu and South to Rancho Paloss Verdes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryR257
50,Rode the Roller Coaster,Stopped for lunch and checked out the pier and decided to be adventurous and ride the roller coaster! so fun and many venders to grab gifts from; also the best churro ever!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sacsoup
40,The pier,The pier itself is pritty good. There is a little area to find out the history of the pier which was interesting. The rides pritty good for a pier theme park but there aren't many. Worth a visit if you have some time or are in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/76gavinw
50,"Super touristy, but you have to do it","I love this Pier, but I hate how crowded it gets during the summer - it’s like trying to walk through molasses. That being said, if you’re a tourist in Santa Monica, I recommend you walk by and get your picture in front of the Route 66 sign and ride the Ferris Wheel and embrace the fact that you’re on vacation and you’re at the Santa Monica Pier!!If you have a Groupon account, a lot of times you can get the wristbands for unlimited rides for 50% off. Otherwise the rides are pricey and you’ll still have leftover tickets since the whole system is set up to make you want to buy more tickets in order to use up the ones you already have.There are various games you can play and food for purchase; if you’ve never had one, try a strawberry funnel cake. It’s the quintessential American dessert for when you’re walking around on a sunny day contemplating if you want to ride rides or just people watch.There are bathrooms towards the end of the pier that are surprisingly clean, and there are a number of stalls. If you walk all the way to the end, you can watch some fisherman try to reel in fish. It smells a bit, but it’s the ocean, so what would you expect? There are benches for you to sit although those are usually taken. I would recommend coming here at dusk if you can - the rides light up and you can watch a gorgeous Santa Monica sunset while overlooking the ocean. It does get chilly at night though so bring a light sweater.Tdlr; a major Santa Monica institution; good to visit during day or night, and good for families, friends, and couples.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shanellesua
30,Nothing to Have to see,"The trip to the Pier was a hassle because of traffic. Do not go on a weekend. We had to turn around and go on a weekday. The Pier itself has few attractions, some rides for the kids and one arcade. There are some outdoor Kiosks and plenty of peddlers trying to sell you some cheap items. In an hour your through it all or maybe less time. The ocean is always beautiful though. Parking in a garage right off the Pier was successful and the cost was reasonable.I guess you have to see it if visiting the area but you may be surprised by the lack luster appeal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenrM2787RW
40,Fun Pace to Visit,"It was crowded but had plenty of parking and lots of restaurants, shops, and boardwalk vendors (lots of churros). Watched the sunset from here, which was a great experience. Bubba Gump Shrimp restaurant is right on the pier and has fun souvenirs from the Forrest Gump movie. Short walk to Del Frisco restaurant for a great steak afterward. Very windy and much cooler than it is further off the water, so dress accordingly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/momuvami
40,Great sunset,"People goes to this iconic venture for the wrong reasons, full of stories and places to snack, but the unique thing about this place is to view beautiful sun sets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rafcama57
40,Cool to see,Kids had fun on the ferris wheel...neat to walk around and see the sites. Little pricey but what do you expect!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaysonb604
40,Really Fun Half Day Entertainment,"The rides are a bit expensive, but there is plenty to do and see on the pier with shops, restaurants and buskers. We saw the best magician we have ever seen busking on the pier. He blew our minds! The pier gives you great views of the coastline and beach. The old fashioned soda shop is very cool. We also enjoyed watching people fish on the end of the pier. Great spot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MartyD655
40,Always a must,"Even though it’s crowded and crazy with people it always worth a visit. This time I truly enjoyed the jazz music at the end of the pier, super talent guy and very relaxing to sit and watch the ocean and listen to his music",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keltickimb
40,Like the movies,Crazy to be in the same spot as we’ve seen so many times in film. It’s a cool pier and the beach is nice too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/micahloewen
40,Famous and crowded place,"One of the most famous place in Los Angeles areas, it's always busy and crowded, sometime it's hard to find a parking place. It is family friendly, there is mini amusement park. Nice ocean view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClaudioY8
10,Awful,"Ridiculously crowded, sleazy, dirty, and literally nothing to do unless you’re into bad, overpriced tourist-trap food, and crappy, overpriced trinkets. I really wanted to love this place but it’s just awful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BTrushin
50,Pleasant area,Stopped here mid-morning while passing through Santa Monica and the crowds hadn’t arrived yet so it was pleasantly quiet. The restaurants and food stalls etc had just opened so service was swift and polite.Great walks along Ocean Blvd with nice views of the beach. Shopping n the town was great- lots of brand and boutique stores. Nice modern town and a pleasant area to spend some time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndyAitch65
40,A must-see,"Everything you expect from the famous Santa Monica pier. Try to be there in the evening when the lights come on as it is quite lovely. Lots of people, of course. We felt very safe at the pier and walking around in the vicinity of the pier, as well",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LookingforGilligan
40,Girls getaway,"Took my teenage daughter and her 2 best friends for a final getaway trip for their spring break. Pier was clean, not much foot traffic and everything closed down early. Lights were beautiful at night but was expecting more activity, maybe because it’s their slow time? Girls got bored rather quickly with the activities provided there. Told them summertime would be busier...another reason for another getaway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimAndRobby
50,Cool area,"We visited this place because it’s just a place you have to go to while in LA. It was fun, there are many things to do there, specially with kids",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FLMario7589
50,Meander on the Pier for great views,"I enjoyed walking along the Pier seeing the sites, street performers and watching people fish. Feel the ocean breeze and ride the roller coaster just for fun. Go midway and look back for great pictures. Beach, Water and a Theme Park! Who can ask for anything more. Yes it is touristy but after all isn't that what I am and I may pass this way only once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Americanflygirl

40,Fun but busy,We visited the pier on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. The pier was very busy but great for people watching. We rode the Ferris wheel and didn’t have a long wait even though the area was crowded. Beautiful sunset and views!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mauryt31
50,Great time,Santa Monica pier is great for someone who loves the ocean and amusement parks! Although extremely busy it’s a great place to spend some time. One of my favorite things is feeding the sea lion at the end of the pier. Great view of the beach and some cool shops. I love that their is an arcade,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erin09052
30,It won't take long to walk to the end if you're pressed for time,We strolled the length of the pier after lunch. It was bustling with tourists but felt safe. There were kiosks with people selling souvenirs and buskers playing various instruments. They did not pester us nor were they pushy. They were definitely part of the atmosphere that was the pier. Our teenagers weren't interested in riding any rides so we left.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveToTravelTerrie
40,"Nice, but gets very crowded","We really enjoyed the pier. We did not ride any of the rides, but the atmosphere was a lot of fun. Make sure to look at the carousel! Plenty of street vendors with various wears to keep you interested.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DR815
30,All the same,"It's nice to see and is the end of route 66 , but the pier is very tacky and is just the same as pier 49 in San Francisco. Nice for a stroll.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lillyKent
20,Tourist trap,"Fun to visit for a few minutes, but really not much to see of any note. Some of the buskers were very talented (violinist and bass player) but overall very crowded and not worth the effort.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/realcagooner
30,Interesting entertainment,"Went here in April. It was packed! Too crowed, a little windy too. The people there are entertaining... wow",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RyanWoodley
50,Busy!,Visited the Santa Monica Pier on a Wednesday in a week without any holidays or breaks and it was still super crowded! I did enjoy it though and the weather was perfect. Easily accessible to folks taking public transit from Downtown LA... the Expo Line 'Downtown Santa Monica' station is 5-7 minute walk away.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Orcadas
50,Lots of fum,"This is a great place to go if you enjoy being outside and active. We went for the day (took Metro from downtown). Had a great lunch, and rented bikes (very easy to rent parked bikes from city vendors, don’t bother with in person rental shops). We got a bit sunburned but my 17 year old boy really enjoyed it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amanda_B109
50,Must see whilst in LA and surrounding areas,"I’ve always wanted to come to Santa Monica pier and it did not disappoint! Lots of great stalls, performers, shops and food places. We watched the sunset from the pier also and it was amazing. I would highly recommend stopping here if you are hosting Santa Monica or are in Los Angeles and neighbouring cities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shannoncollyer_17
50,Iconic Destination,I walk down the pier everytime I hit the beach in Santa Monica. The views up to Malibu are super cool and it's fun to see the fishermen off the pier. And plenty of good food in the restaurants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJRunner301
50,A must see,Lots of things to so and see and great for people watching. Lots of options for places to eat and drink. Its great that the whole area comes with quick and good wifi.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeeS_x
50,Beautiful sunset,You must go there to contemplate the sunset at the end of the pier and share with all the people ! Inspirational !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/j0ussetf
40,Great for jogging,For me this place is great for jogging when we are in LA. You can easily run north for about 5.5 Km or south for around 5 Km. Parking is sometimes expensive and can get to $3 per hour. Ruth Haephrati. Michael Haephrati,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Haephrati
30,Anyone with a WHEELCHAIR,"Born and raised in LA. Been here over 20 times. First time with my 90+ year old grandmother. She is now in a wheelchair. We love going to the end of the pier. This time we took her in the chair and the path was super bumpy. I'm writing this hoping someone will see it and somehow improve the path from a rubber 1 ply condom to something sturdy enough to not shake the retinas out of my grandma's skull. The roller coaster is still fun, but you'll get more a thrill if you have someone push you in a wheelchair down the pier instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/milsb2019
50,Good day out with family!,"Santa Monica is really beautiful and has lots of things to go around and enjoy. To stay with it has beautiful beach and a small fun park with rides for kids and young people. It also has lot of shops for shopping and eating out.Do look out for some performances by some really good artists whether it’s a magic trick or a song rendition or a dance, they all are worth watching (& don’t forget to give couple of dollars or whatever you like the artist is worth of). Keep the art alive guys!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thefastfurious
10,Overcrowded,"This wasn't for us. We didn't come to Santa Monica with overly high expectations but the pier will still below par. We came to the pier both later at night and in the afternoon, both times it was very crowded and there wasn't a lot of room to move. If an amusement park is your thing, then you will like it, otherwise I wouldn't recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatieM849
20,"Interesting, great to see some things as I imagined but old and dirty.",Nice to visit and see in person. I kind of wished I came at night as in the day its age shows. From someone that cane from the other side of the world to see it I think Hollywood has given me a false expectation.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattgZ1306AK
40,Childhood Dream... kind of...,Santa Monica Pier was one of those must do places for us. It’s a place that we all come up with our own ideas and expectations from images we have seen. It was an ok trip! On the afternoon we went it was freezing cold. The pier was packed full of tourists. It was very different to the what I had imagined. I would recommend going on a warm day or rugging right up. We enjoyed the entertainment on the pier! Awesome photo opportunities 🌸,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hollascope
40,Great place to enjoy some carnival activities,"My sister and I stopped over in LA and one of the stops we made was at the Santa Monica Pier. It provided a fun carnival atmosphere with beach views on either side. There were different street food and street vendors. I’d recommend is as a place for families, teens and even a good date place to be able to walk around and enough some carnival fare.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianasanto
40,Nice,"Rides, food, and games galore. Pretty clean and patrolled by local police, so pretty safe. Great views of ocean and coastline.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dshow99
30,Not worth going out of your way for,We liked Santa Monica and the beach is expansive and clean. We walked out on the pier and you get good views back towards Santa Monica and also of the Ocean. Didn't go on any of the rides looked old and worn. The pier is full of tat in the shops and tacky street vendors. The restaurants looked pretty bad as well.Typical tourist trap. Didn't have a car so can't comment on the parking but looked very tight on a busy weekend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KiwichickAuckland
40,Pier Visit,Cool for a brief stop off but bit tacky overall. Considering end of Route 66 I expected more genuine evidence and less cheap t shirts!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robo601
50,Beautiful evening!!,This is a must do if you are in the Santa Monica or Los Angeles area! I was lucky to be there on a beautiful evening and was able to see the sunset as well. This is a big pier that is on the beach and even extends into the ocean. You are able to get a great view of the ocean from just about anywhere. There are several restaurants and shops as well as an arcade. You simply can’t go wrong by coming here. I paid 7.00 to park at a parking lot located right next to the pier but it was well worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/isaacGM03
50,great spot to spend the afternoon,Rented bikes to drive along the beach and ended up walking along the pier. The pier had lots of restaurants and venders. The amusement park was pretty cool! The ferris wheel offers great views of Santa Monica beach. Great for couples or families.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kickinitwithkyla
30,Huhum!,"If you've been there once, you're better off visiting other/better attractions in the area. Whatever you do, disregard the ""monks"" persistently begging.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RexY750
40,"So fun esp for families, great entertainment","Went while in the area. A lot of fun for families (there is a game room, and food vendors like for churros, mango slices, etc.), along with constantly changing entertainers (musicians, jugglers, street dancing, etc.) right on the beautiful ocean that is Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsCasualTravelor
20,Much Hyped,"I heard a lot about the Santa Monica Pier, but the reality is, it is much hyped. Its just an average pier. Very crowded and lots of street shops and street artists all through the pier walk. You cannot really enjoy the view. If you are around the area make a stop. Don't have to stretch yourself to go here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reyelefante
30,Seen one seen them all,"The Santa Monica pier set up was fine. There were several vendors, and performers putting on little shows, then requesting money for watching. There were a few rides, we did not partake in the rides. Parking was avail for a price on the beachfront. We ate at one of the restaurants, it was delicious and reasonable. The gifts stores were pricey. The view was incredible, the beach this time of year is not too busy, however the pier itself was packed. Enjoy it was fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MinnaR1
30,"Good Family Fun, Great Sunset",We were visiting LA and were told we should visit the Pier. It is a nice beach and the coast line looks very beautiful. There is nothing spectacular about the pier it self. The amusement park is super expensive (you are betting off putting your money into one of the theme parks). Parking is a big issue. We came there on a weekday very late in the afternoon so we were able to park in the main lot. The Sunset was very beautiful and worth experiencing the moment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haalio
50,Fun for the whole family,"We spent about four hours at the pier one evening with our two children (3 and 5). There were rides for all of us to enjoy, including small versions for our three year old and a larger roller coaster for adults and older kids. A highlight was definitely riding the Ferris wheel at sunset. There wasn’t much of a line and we hit it just as the sun was setting. After playing arcade games, winning some carnival prizes, and riding the rides, we had dinner right at the pier and walked out to the end of the pier. It’s easy to rack up costs, so it’s worth the unlimited rides wrist band. We ended the night with a round of bumper cars, which worked out great as there is a section for younger kids and a section for adults and older kids - so we all played at the same time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kelshanman
50,Fabulous pier,"Fabulous pier to visit with lots of cafes, souvenir shops and fairground rides. Quite a few buskers, some better than others.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/200janiced
30,Parking tips for Santa Monica Pier,"The pier has its own parking lot, if you turn onto the pier, under the iconic banner sign. You might luck out and park there for $2, or you might have to find street parking further away. This month was my second trip to Santa Monica Pier. The first time I was there was on a hot July day, and the pier's parking lot was full. I found a parking spot on a side street about a half mile south. My second trip was in March. The spring break crowd wasn't big enough to fill the parking lot, so we were happy to pay $2 for the convenience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/363kathyd
40,Great place!,It was ok! It a great place to spend with family and friends but there’s not that many rides for adults. My son did have a great time!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vivicab2019

30,Doesn’t live up to expectations,"Like so many tourism-hyped places, this one has “just enough” so you’re not totally disappointed but definitely not enough to make this a “top shelf” visit.Thankfully it’s surrounded by amazing beaches and taken together, it’s all good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FunkyWanderer
30,Cool place bu crowded,This is a cool spot or kids and tourists but very crowded. be sure to plan ahead for parking and be prepared to shell out minimum $20. Other than that it is a cool spot worth checking out,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/regig143
40,Iconic and very busy,"I recommend going if you’re in the area, but really only to say you’ve done it. I went on a nice sunny weekend and it was a zoo. Pretty cool spot but there’s people everywhere. May be less busy on a weekday, not sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/averageguyreviews
50,Nice place to visit,It was a great day with my daughter. She went to park and we ate ice cream there. There were a lot of artists and entertainments around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/621katyaf
40,A fun place to spend an afternoon,"This pier is reminiscent of the parks back east with the food, souvenir stands and the rides. While not as big, it provides a nice way to spend some time with the kids, with the family or on a date. It can get busy and therefore crowded on the weekends. It provides a nice view of the cliffs and the ocean to the north and south.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gjfromwa

50,You want action ? Go visit Santa Monica Pier!,"This place had a lot going on. If you want to take a calm stroll near the ocean this is not the place to go. That was food vendors, street performes, carousel, people people and more people. We love it! That was those ladies selling mangos ...oh they are so good. My husband had a JapaDog ...it was the bomb",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/renata764

50,Loved it!,"Went in early on Sunday morning, was able to find easy parking right on the pier itself for very reasonable pricing. There were a few nice shops and a bunch of merchants around selling different items. Great food options as well, we LOVED Mariasol's! Also enjoyed going to Pacific Park. Highly recommended place to visit in Santa Monica!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeAnnKelley
50,Absolutely a must to see,"We went 3 times and it was always as crowded at maximum. So many different people, tourists, inhabitants, artists etcFor us the best time was going about 4 pm and walk there till sunset. We made unforgettable photos and saw all this amazing stores. The highlight for the people who knows “Forrest Gump” the movie is to see Babba Gump Shrimps . We had no chance to get in but the people told it is one of the best- what a movie can move to;-) then a walk at Santa Monica Beach is fantastic at sunset time and take a lot of photos!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sven-Papa

30,Bucket List,"This is really a strange thing for me. All of the homeless people kind of take away from the experience. There are also people trying to get you to go on a tour. It is very touristy, but if you are going in Hollywood you should probably check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vchmikey
30,Great Views,Stopped here to walk the pier and people watch. Lots of activities for family entertainment. Parking rate was a flat $7 which was fair. There are restaurants on the pier and in the surrounding area. Nice place to get a funnel cake or some ice cream and watch the sun go down. They have some Route 66 ends here sign but the end of old Route 66 is a little further north near the end of Santa Monica Blvd. It’s a short walk from the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/651kevinj
50,Visit to the Santa Monica Pier,"After having an excellent lunch at the Bubba Gump Restaurant on the pier, my family enjoyed a walk around the pier and then had a volley ball game on the beach. The beach was clean, the people we met were very pleasant and the weather was perfect..This was a wonderful outing on a rather perfect beach day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samc503
40,COLD day,"We stopped by, but the weather was brutally cold, and the wind made hanging out difficult. We explored the interesting but crowded pier. Easy to get twisted around on the highway in, but plenty of parking - for a price. Good to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jjjjironstand

50,It was great !!,"My hubby took me to LA this past weekend and we visited the Santa Monica beach! I loved it. It was soooo much to do out there. You can go put feet in the water, ride scooters & bikes, and other activities. Getting to the beach takes soooo long because of traffic, but besides that it was cool",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mktravelss
10,Stay Away,"There were long lines in front of the restrooms. Apparently, this is about the only place around for the homeless drug addicts to use the restroom.The place is dirty, filthy, and overcrowded. Parking is three dollars an hour. They let us in the parking lot even though it was full and was backed up from people trying to get back out. It took 30 minutes for us to get back out, and then they charged us for an hour of parking.It’s worth repeating- This appeared to be the only place around for the homeless drug addicts to use the restroom.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArkansasJohn
50,A must see,A must see when in California.We come to Santa Monica whenever we're on Cali an md a walk down to the pier is always a must. The views are lovely and it is full of life and fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maisy20

10,Every step finds someone selling something,"The view is obscured by vendors offering to carve your name on a grain of rice, write your name in flowers, explain where Jesus is, sell you fruit or churros. Our children love rides but the overall feel was trashy and old and we were done in 15 minutes.We are opting for a less crowded beach that gets us back to nature and away from vendors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xietsanghua
50,beautiful,"we spend an afternoon there with the kids , a bit of people watching eating churros and ice cream , decided no to do the rides and when for a walk at the beach instead and to our surprise it was fantastic to see a lot of acrobats trains in the beach ...super cool daya must do for me when in L A",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OntarioAna
40,Fun afternoon visit,Visit the pier and ride the Ferris wheel for great views. Tickets are $10 each but are worth it. There are other good rides for children.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FunTravelingAround
40,Very beautiful,Although it was a rainy afternoon this location is a very beautiful location. It is worth the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nmlslo
30,A tourist trap but great people watching,This is free to walk around. We only bought chips (expensive). Nothing against the pier but we don’t enjoy the rides.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Iowatravelfool
30,Don't need much time if not doing rides,"This was a quick stop for us as we didn't go to do the rides. It is an interesting place that seems like you need to see it especially if you are from out of town. There are a lot of food vendors around so go hungry. The view is BEAUTIFUL! It is very windy, rough water and chilly so bring a light jacket. There is parking right off the pier as well as off the beach so you have options. There are public restrooms right on the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Momof2boyz2015
50,Good place to hangout,It has been developed well with good number eateries around it. A wooden bridge that goes straight into the sea. Nice beach which crowded throughout the day. Nice place to click photos & make the visit memorable. There is also a flyer & games section for children.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/7nitink
50,Pier for everyone,Just a great place to walk around and hang out. We were there at sunset and it was beautiful over the Pacific ocean. One more thing bring a jacket. It is usually cooler than inland and there is usually a pretty good breeze.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/961dimitarg
40,Bit of history,"This is arguably one of the must go places in L.A. When you're checking what to do this always comes up. The pier itself is a great place to head to, the views are great from both sides and great for photo taking. You can see street performers and other activities as well as the expected rides. The view from the end of the pier is also really good and we loved the painted deck... ... get someone to stand on the steps and take a photo looking down. Great place to wander especially if you have children, very touristy but that's part of the fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debra1965

50,Santa Monica Pier is a must visit for families visiting LA,"Santa Monica Piet is fun for the whole family, complete with an old school fun fair with state of the art Ferris wheel to get the best views over Santa Monica beach all the way to Malibu and beyond. Alternately hours can be whiled away in the gaming arcade with fun for all ages to be had.Local residents can enjoy learning aerial silk trapeze skills there as well as throw a great kids party in the little aquarium downstairs or the beautiful old school Carousel on the pier.There are many and diverse food and restaurant options, my personal favorite being the Mexican restaurant right at the end of the pier, a perfect spot to view a magnificent California sunset over the sea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katej107
40,"Still cool, but parking is no fun","IF you have never been it's must do while in Santa Monica. It's where I got engaged so it's a special place for me. The performers and the boardwalk games still steal the show, and it's hard to beat a sunset on the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/744Dmack744
50,Fun day at the Santa Monica Pier,"My two teenage girls had a blast riding all the fun rides at the pier. I rode a couple with them myself, then enjoyed relaxing on a bench and watching the beautiful ocean. Great way to spend a beautiful day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amyblackburn
30,Ok for a day,"Maybe because it was chilly, we didn't really care much for the pier. We were able to buy a few souvenirs and we did see a wedding taking place. There were too few vendors for my liking, but the view was nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KentuckyGirl1972
30,Iconic and touristy old-style amusement pier,"Your kids will probably like the rides, amusement park food, and getting their name painted on a cardboard sign. Good people watching at night, for sure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CleopatraBunny
50,The pier is the end of Route 66,"Brilliant place and the end of the iconic Route 66. Lots of shops, street entertainers and funfair. A must visit place if you are in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidhW3123GU
40,Iconic California landmark,"i would say this is a must see because it embodies the California image. However, as a pier for activities, dining etc.. it could be better. The restaurants are okay but overpriced. The rides are fun but not spectacular, But if you leave LA without seeing you will regret it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebB818
40,Great SM Pier!,"I had a meeting for lunch in the area, but got there early. Walked around the pier a bit. Looking good on a great spring day! Busy but not too crazy. I thought it was decently clean, seemed safe, etc. Not as seedy as the Venice boardwalk, lol",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricLAX

30,Good and bad,A great pier to visit. Carnival type atmosphere with rides and games. People playing music for tips. My daughter has her name written with symbols. Says recommended 1.00 per letter tip and was told 14.00 for the 6 letters....so be careful with that. Restaurants along the pier. Was a fun place to see and visit not a place I NEED to go back to but definitely fun to see once.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieBandSteveB
50,The end of the line,Visted the pier with family felt like a kid again my husband and myself are planning on driving the whole route 66 next year what an adventure,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/463tammyl
40,Exactly as expected. Fun few hours.,"We had a warm and sunny day in March. Teens rode the roller coaster. Very busy with people, as expected. Got a few customary touristy photos and walked the beach a bit. Plenty of parking in a nearby lot. Police around keeping the peace. Food options nearby if you don’t want Bubba Gump or pier food. Plan for maybe 2-3 hours. Huge beach but water is chilly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RCMommy
10,Coney Island Part 2,Where is the beautiful Santa Monica Pier I fell in love with a few years ago? When did masses of people start to trash it? Traffic is reminiscent of the 405 in rush hour traffic. You run into bikes and electric scooters. Flat rate public parking is $25!!! I feel badly every time I see a homeless person. So sad. I needed to walk past the amusement park where the gymnastics beach was to start feeling relaxed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danicg
50,So much fun!,This was a great place to take my teenage son. He really enjoyed going on the rides and I enjoyed the vendors and the view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smilingheart77

50,Great Place to relax and watch time go by.,"Have been here on numerous occasions. Stop at the entrance to the pier and take some fun pictures with the Rout 66 sign. Walk to the endof the pier pose with a large plasticized shark ala Jaws. The restaurant at the end of the pier has a upper level with a great view, another photo opp. Have tableside guacamole that is first class with your favorite beverage and watch the waves and people go by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BruceEdwardChiTown
30,Not sure what all the excitement is about - suppose they've never seen a British Pier,"Short walk from road to the end of the pier. Full of tourist shops, cafes, restaurants and fair ground rides. Nothing to write home about!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sharonfv

50,Must see!,"Interesting entertainment, rides, and vendors on the pier. The beach and view is beautiful. A lot to see and do in one place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/onefrzldmom
10,Dirty contributing to water pollution,There’s honestly no point in going here... nothing fun to do. It’s also really dirty and the bathrooms were also gross. There was trash all over which undoubtedly blows into the ocean sadly. Won’t go back. Really sad that they can’t keep the place clean and people throw trash on the ground. I honestly wouldn’t go back even if it was clean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haileycox11
20,Not Worth It,"When we went, it was in the middle of the summer. The pier itself was very dirty and the bathrooms were horrible. That would not have been a big deal (it is LA after all) except that the amusement park was very disappointing. Nothing worth spending money on to ride. Many homeless people and other patrons line the pier with signs showing their disgust for our government using very colorful language. If you are looking for a nice place to take the family, Santa Monica Pier is not it. The only plus is that there is live music at the end of the Pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R413THjuliet
50,Must see for first timers.,"After a disappointing stop for our group at Fisherman's Village, we made our way to the Santa Monica Pier. As it turned out, the time lost at the village was a blessing at the pier. Everyone had a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geraldr683
40,Cool Spot with Lots to Do!,"The pier itself was really cool with lots of shops, attractions, restaurants, and vendors. It was touristy but fun. It was a little dirty in areas, but that comes with the LA territory. The beach was gorgeous alongside the pier. This spot is worth a visit. Four stars from me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travellingirvine
50,"Very touristy, still beautiful, wild mix of homeless and uber weatlthy","fun place to visit at night, lots of junk food, homeless, tourists, fishermen, sea gulls. The fun park is lovely at night with all the lights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fearlessmsla
50,FUN Experience,"Impressed with what a great set-up and layout. Rides appeared to be modern and well maintained inspire of being located in a very salty and harsh environment. For rides, they sell a per ride ticket but the best deal is a wristband for unlimited rides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toddc824
40,Walked Pier,We walked around the pier and most shops were closed. It seemed more of a tourist attraction then local venue.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/532martyp

One of the large coastal piers in the West Coast boasts of nice restaurants, roller coaster, Ferris wheel, novelty acts along the pier, and a parking lot to boot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Explorer0515
50,Always a good time at the pier,"Of course its a very busy tourist spot, but the people watching makes it fun. Parking can be hard to find so just pay to park, its not that expensive. The walk down can be fun and the pier itself offers entertainment. There are great pictures to be taken at day and night although the night pictures offer the lights of the rides in the background. I have not been on the rides but they are reasonably priced for the area. Some souvenir shopping is available. And one time my sister and I rode a bike from Venice to here. That was fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tykane01
50,Fun For All,"A great walk as the sun sets. Very eclectic array of cultures. From buskers to face painters to card sharks, its all there. Great restaurants at the end. Great sunset photography. Don't forget to hire a Lime scooter to get around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glennh168

40,A Must see if you go to Santa Monica,"One of the most iconic places I have always wanted to visit. Yes it’s just a pier, but it has an iconic history and it’s the end of over 2000km of the infamous Route 66. Sit and watch the surfers on Venice and Santa Monica beaches and just take in the scenery. Brilliant!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SagaloutsTour
50,See many as you can,"There are several piers that go from Ventura County through LA County and Orange County. They are unique to Southern California in that there are so many of them and they all seem to be near cousins to each other. Santa Monica Pier is clearly the big glamorous cousin. It's a wonderful way to get a different perspective on the ocean by walking straight out onto it but having the opportunity to look back onto the shore line and city. The ""amusement park"" is probably fun with young kids or if you are a kid at heart but the pier itself is the star. But don't stop here. There are several more that aren't far away that dot the coast both north and south.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StationToStation
30,I can say I’ve been there.,"We had lunch near the pier, so we walked around afterwards. It was nice. Beautiful weather. Carnival atmosphere. I can say I’ve been there but really don’t have to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lngi224

20,Ok,A bit tacky. Good views of coast and mountains. Best to do during the week; weekends can get pretty crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/163toml
50,Loved it!!! Easy to get to via metro,"My daughter and I visited on her spring break and loved it! We lunched at Bubba Gumps, which was yummy and also shopped at 3rd Street Promenade. Good for a day or just 2-3 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SCgirlatheart1
40,A must-see,"Yes this is a ""tourist trap"" but of course a must see when in LA. We stayed in Marina Del Rey and rented bicycles and electrical scooters and came along Venice Beach Boardwalk to Santa Monica Pier.We had dinner at Seaside at the Pier before we walked out on the pier. Main goal were to just take a look and have some fun at Pacific Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MisterTNorway

30,"Nice Visit, but Bumpy for Wheelchairs","The pier was pretty cool. I use a wheelchair and we went to the parking lot under the pier that's by the beach. It was $7 to park, but I asked about disability parking and the guy said it was free as long as I had my handicap placard. We left it, but I showed him my disability ID and he let us in and told me to put it where it's visible in the dashboard, and warned us that we might get a citation. There's a ramp to get up to the pier and there was also parking on the pier, but I didn't ask about ADA parking. It is a boardwalk (BOARDwalk), so it was super bumpy even with the plastic ""mat"" they had covering the boards as a sidewalk or something. The park was closed and I also didn't ask about accessibility, but they may be accommodating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tcage26
40,Worthwhile destination,"The in SoCal, this place will pop up as a destination, and it's a good one for walking, people entertainment, sun and water, selfies and Instagrams, and perhaps the amusements on the pier itself. This was a rainy day for me, but I've been there a few other times. It's a good place to see the extent of California beaches, and a glimpse of life here. The actual venues on the pier may be the last thing you actually make use of, unless it's food or your feeling a need to ride the ferris wheel. Worth a stop and nice to get away from the car culture for awhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/profits101
50,Great Place to visit,"If you're traveling to southern California, do visit the Santa Monica Pier. The Pacific Ocean with the mountains in the background has some breath taking views.

Great setting, at the edge of the ocean, but you have to wade through the masses of tourists and stands selling low grade souvenirs and keep your wallet safe from the occasional pickpockets.The amusement area is probablu fun for kids, I just wasn't with any and I'm not in the right age group for it! ;-)The best time to visit is probably early, when it's quiet and at sunset, when it can be spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wahroongan
20,A bit raunchy!,The pier was a bit crazy we saw drugged out women fighting that lasted like 15 minutes and no one seemed to care. A real tourist trap in my opinion with great views of the Pacific. Do yourself a favor and skip the pier... the town is very nice and worth walking or scootering around!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evang277

You can stroll the area, take pics, see performers and grab a bite all in the immediate proximity.The pier offers a great photo op of the coastline & beach too. Very fun day out for the whole family.Visitors can Uber to the entrance, drive & park or take public transportation to get here.

50,Straight out of the films,"We visited on a sunny amazing day. We used our hop on/off bus tickets to get here and it was worth the ride. A lovely old pier with a selection of shops, restaurants and attractions. A number of street performers all along the pier. A really nice place to visit and another amazing memory to an incredible holiday !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steve40_12

50,Great evening spot,"This pier is vibrant, entertaining and old-school fun any of time day, but especially in the evening when you’ve got all the neon lights glistening in the dark sky, artists playing instruments and people shrieking on the ridesI arrived just after sunset and caught some great views of the Pacific Ocean and the coast before it really comes to lifeYou’re not going to spend 8hrs here unless the weather is spot on, but for an evening of entertainment you can’t go wrong",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mongreladam

30,Iconic but so-so,"We went to the must-see pier and were a little underwhelmed. It had everything a tourist trap needs: souvenir shops, arcades, street performers, photo ops, and food. With all of the other beautiful things to do in the area, there was nothing to keep us here for more than 20 minutes, since we weren’t hungry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenRed2014
50,Fantastic!,We loved Santa Monica pier! There are plenty to see and do and our only regret was staying too short time. We'd love coming back and spend at least a whole weekend near Santa Monica Pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wanderlustee_store
20,Too crowded,"This place used to be a great place to people watch. It is now incredibly annoying due to over population. It is incredibly dirty. However, the good thing is that it is only blocks from Santa Monica promenade. I would suggest going to the promenade. A couple of seafood restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dreamer803041
40,California's oldest amusement pier !,"Built in 1908, Santa Monica Pier is California's oldest amusement pier and well worth checking out if you are in the area. There are various gaming stalls and eateries as you walk along the boarded pier deck while the Pacific Park amusement park houses a solar powered Ferris wheel along with other rides. The pier also marks the western terminus f Route 66 and a sign stating this is a popular photo point.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/92stem

50,Highschoolers on a trip,"Definitely not to be missed with the famous Route 66 sign and the pier. Always crowded, but worth a visit. Shopping is at hand's reach as well as food courts. Inexpensive bike rental available, I'd suggest a bike ride to the close-by Venice beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/204ursap
50,Susanadana,I went last year I love this beach park is so nice restaurants we at at bubba Gump great food it was early in morning and family gathering great service there is also a Mexican restaurant before pier that sells lobster enchiladas. I apologize for not remembering name my sister took me for my birthday there 2 years ago. The pier is very nice and clean rides updated homes around here are beautiful such a great atmosphere to me I think this beach is the cream of the crop if you have never been here it for sure a must visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/75fatty
40,Crowded and overhyped,We arrived around 11:30 am by Uber and there was already quite a few people packed onto the pier. Not quiet shoulder to shoulder but certain spots were that way.The view to the north is quite nice on the pier and used that for some photo ops.We walked to the south for some impressive photos of the pier from a distance. Perhaps 1-3 miles?Lots of people wanting your money on the pier doing all kinds of things for it.Never tried the food or rides; although they seemed good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/922kristian
50,Beautiful pier and beach view,"The pier itself is beautiful.We got there on a sunny day and the view was clear and great.It is a very calm place, even with all the people around.You can go on the rides or just walk around, listen to the streep performances and buy souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lotanp

40,A California must do!,My husband and I came here for the day. We ate lunch at one of the restaurants at the beginning of the pier. Ended up having a funnel cake on their pier. We rode the Ferris wheel which was fun. $10 per person though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/polish_princess82
50,Loved it,"Santa Monica pier was lovely and just like in the movies. The pier is big, colourful and lively. There's lots going on. Some good restraunts and beautiful views. We see some seals playing in the water. It was magical. The sunset was also beautiful. A must if your in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ALCBS
40,Worthwhile,It’s a worthwhile walk from Venice beach to the pier but it is worth the walk seeing all the people working out and entertaining people .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevchezza
30,Just okay,"We really wanted to see the pier and enjoy the beach on our recent visit to LA but the pier just wasn't as exciting as I remember and my kids weren't all that impressed. Maybe a better experience for younger kids, but my 10 and 17 yr olds weren't too excited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EHayes575
40,Santa Monica Pier,"We visited the SM pier on Friday, Feb. 15 and enjoyed our time at the pier. It was late morning and into the early afternoon. The pier was built so but not over crowded. We were able to move around and saw some spectacular views of the Pacific Ocean up close. There are some amusement park rides - but we did not ride any of the rides. 6-10 restaurants were open and cooking up lunch. We had a drink at Bubba Gump's- which was enjoyable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Titan11Omaha
30,Nice place but best to see from the distance,The pier is nice and very iconic but we preferred to stay down on the beach and have it as background for some nice pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielhansen13
30,Ticked it off the bucket list but didn’t stick around.,"Didn’t spend a great deal of time here as very tacky and commercial with lots of crappy souvenirs and cruddy buskers. Was a good old school game arcade to spend some time in but a lot of the machines were out of order. Loads of people but easy to get around, didn’t spend a long time here. Pier is a little tired.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CairnsMel12
40,Walk on the pier,Beautiful but too crowded. The sunset is absolutely beautiful. Lots of vendors and performers of all kinds on the pier. Not a quiet place for sure but happy we saw it and visited Santa Monica,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helenag624
50,A Perfect Family's Place,"Santa Monica Pier is the must see place if one visits this beautiful city. A well maintained structure accommodating an imposing Ferris wheel, good restaurants and food outlets, gift shops and lively activities attract tourists from all walks of life. The weekends in particular turn into festivities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sufeesm
30,Nice but very crowded !,"We decided to go on a Friday night, it was very crowded.The sun was setting so we did get some nice pictures.It's worth the visit but be ready for a lot of people.Parking is a challenge but you can find structures with valet.If you want to self park in the streets .... a bit more difficult.I wouldn't go there just for the Pier. There are a lot of restaurants in the area and the Promenade. The Pier is part of the trip, but not the focal point.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FTichy
40,Nice but not wow,Just my own opinion but I wasn’t blown away with the pier. It’s definitely a place to go and have a look but wouldn’t rush to recommend as much as the other places we have visited. Has rides and restaurants but nothing we don’t get in Brighton!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrsvikki23
50,Go Back In Time,"When America was more innocent, the County Fair was a rite of passage. Today, you can find the Ferris wheel, the merry go round, the salt water taffy stand and a host of humanity at the Santa Monica Pier. Located where Route 66 intersects with Pacific Coast Highway, there are high and low dining options, games to play (and prizes to win for that someone special), as well as shopping opportunities that range from kitsch to memorable.An easy date, a way to escape the day-to-day, a place to collect your thoughts or just enjoy the shrieks of happy people on rides, this is a one-size-fits-all proposition. With the Pacific Ocean below, nature is the costar -- and it's a great balance to the carny awesome of the rides/contests.A good way to hook back into a gentler time, the Pier remains a getaway that's not that far away from Malibu, Brentwood, Ventura, Hollywood, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LadyGoodman615
10,Very touristy!,"Not worth going there, it is very touristy and actually not much to do there. Also, I wouldn‘t stay for a lunch there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelerLux007
30,"Tacky, good views",Not my most favourite location. I found the area quite tacky and not the most pleasant of areas to spend a day. Great views at the back of the pier of the Pacific. Some great local entertainment dotted along the pier.Worth a visit but don’t plan on spending too long here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gazza2209
30,"Too crowded, touristy","This was kinda disappointing. Sure we were there early afternoon on a nice Saturday afternoon few days of crummy weather , but it was so crowded it was hard to walk and enjoy the surroundings.The view of the beach and ocean are beautiful. Aim for a less crowded time to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mike95128
40,Lots going on at sunset,We visited just before sunset and it was very busy on the pier. There are lots of shops and some restaurants plus all the amusements. The lights on the rides were lit up in Christmas colours which was very festive,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaynic
40,Great place to visit,"Such a vibrant place to spend a good few hours. Lots of shops, eateries and entertainment. Some of the buskers that preformed here were amazing. You can get some great photos from the ferris wheel. Such a must do for an iconic place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Angels_Are_Devious
40,"Fun, especially for kids!","Rides and games in a beautiful atmosphere surrounded by the ocean, also beautiful light designs on the ferris wheel at night. Amusement park foods like ice cream and funnel cakes available along with street entertaiment, some of which is funny, but also some very good musicians. Can walk down steps and be right on the beach and ocean front bike path. Gets super crowded in summer, so if you want to miss the thickest crowds go during the week.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/921miriamf
50,Pier,"If you want to just gaze at the ocean( there is a high chance that you can see sea lions), watch the shore, grab a bite, or try some of the rides including the famous Ferris wheel, which is lit up at nights, this place is for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlaraAygen
50,Fun place,We went in Feb so it was on the cooler side for California but it did t stop us from putting our feet in the pacific water. The pier was crowded even though the amusements were not open. Still a fun place to visit and great for people watching. Lots to do in and around the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Krissyalx
50,Fun Weekend,Great spot to relax and have fun with friends. Eat swim enjoy the sun and just bum around for the day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertsudakow
50,Great place,I loved walking on the pier. it was in the evening in February so not real busy. Fun place to go see with friends,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angiel137
30,"Just too busy, go to Malibu pier","The pier would best be visited first thing in the morning when the hordes have not descended on to it. We got there about 1:30 and it was just so busy and you had to move like a snake and weave your way through the crowds. As you weave your way you are bombarded with an assortment of ""professionals"" all signing or shouting one thing or another. None of them where any good but all seemed to have very good speakers to assault your ears. Once at the end of the pier trying to get any photo without people just walking infant or even stopping to take photos was impossible. as i say first thing in the morning would allow you to take your time and see the pier and all it has to offer. The best bit for me was hiring bikes on the pier and then cycling along to Venice beach. However, it's not what you'd call cheap to hire a bike for an hour but if you have the cash its a really nice way to get to Venice",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/31drewm
30,Ok for a brief visit,"Having visited Venice Beach and been very disappointed, we then walked along the beach path to Santa Monica and visited the Pier. The Pier is very busy, full of tourists from California and beyond. It was nice to walk out beyond the shoreline but was very busy and hard to find a quiet spot. The food options are standard fast food and the prices of the souvenirs are twice the price of Beverly Hills. (how does that work) Our daughter wanted to buy a Los Angeles sign which was $14 or $15 on the pier so she ended up buying it at a mall in Beverly Hills for $7.Santa Monica is a hefty Uber drive from West Hollywood or Beverly Hills and takes approx. 45mins due to LA consistent traffic. For this reason, this is not a must visit if you only have a couple of days in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toddtrippas
40,Must see attraction in L.A.,"This is an attraction that's worth visiting if you want to at least get an iconic experience in the L.A. area. The pier is the end of the line for the famous Route 66. It has an amusement park, restaurants, people watching, a beach, and more. It's not very clean and kind of has an old boardwalk feel to it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickd401
50,Vacation again,"A bit windy that day, but as always a great place to visit. The hamburgers at Pier Burger were exceptional. The pier is always a planned stop for us when in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lfwalz
50,"Beautiful, entertaining, fun for the whole family!",Took the whole family to the Santa Monica pier as one of many stops on a very long road trip! Ended up being one of the funnest and most memorable stops on our trip! The roller coaster out on the pier is a must! You won’t be disappointed!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dumak4
50,Santa Monica Pier,"Took an Uber from LA. And had a delightful day wandering around. It was just fun to see the ocean, the people and all the attractions. Disappointed that I couldn’t ride the Ferris wheel because I was a single. So many places to eat. I had no idea that Route 66 ended there. Then I wandered around the area. Little treasures everywhere. A definite destination if you are in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanL49120
40,Amazingly beautiful,"Pacific ocean was mesmerizing, as well as the flock of birds. There’s a public parking near the pier. We went there in the afternoon and left before the evening lights. It’s great for families as there’s a lot of activities and street performers. Just beware of the bird poop and scammers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/212applef
40,Fun!,Super fun experience!! Happy we stopped in! The bubba gump restaurant was fantastic and the views were beautiful from pier! We will be back with kids to ride the rides!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/downum93
30,Entertaining Pier,"What can a pier be, well exciting, colorful, crowded great place to people watch. It was not a place I would make a point or go out of my way to visit but if you are in the area it is free to walk on and doesn’t take much time to walk tothe end so take the opportunity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glennab_13
50,Great place,"Beautiful fun for the whole family...small shops,entertainment and food a great place to spend the afternoon",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/417juliec417
30,7 day visit to Santa monica,"Went to the pier on a few occasions,it was ok .Once you have been on there 1st time that’s it seen it and done it.The problem going on there was the guys so called giving away CD for a donation and they do drive you mad ,just say no thanks and keep walkingPrices of the food on there are extortionate 15$ for a hot dog .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marion25
40,Great place to see,We enjoyed our time here. The sunset was beautiful. We had dinner at the Albright the seafood was good as was the hamburger I had. We found it was a bit pricey and the service was not great. The pier is very clean if you haven’t seen it yet then you should check it out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cruiser154995
40,World famous ( i don’t know why?),The pier has several down tempo attractions. Young kids I’m sure will have a grand time on some of the rides. I only have one caveat.... the Ferris wheel is worth the wait to ride on. Marvellous city and ocean views when at the top of the ride.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HH676
50,California experience,"On my second visit to Santa Monica Pier the Los Angeles experience is in the air. To see people from all walks of life coming to visit Santa Monica beaches, shopping for souvenirs and American sandwiches on the pier builds peace in me and how I wish the whole world was just as peaceful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulMM
50,Iconic!,"World famous attraction. Miles of golden beaches, attractions on the pier. Enough to keep you occupied all day with the kids",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dsasto
50,Winter visit,It was freezing when we went but there were still so many people out. Lots of food trucks to nibble on or walk on the beach. Souvenir shops and indoor eating too. Try The Lobster at the beginning of the pier if you miss a Boston-type steamed lobster dish.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happiestprawn79
20,Bucket list! The end of Rt 66.,"Since we lived at Lexington, Illinois on route 66 where I was a Chevrolet dealer seeing the end of route 66 was a must do! We went there at night which was probably the most advisable so that the attraction was more palatable. The bathrooms at the ocean end of the pier should be condemned, and which ever “department of toilets” in California is in charge of them should be embarrassed that they let the public go in there.It’s one of those bathrooms were you can taste the urine in the air!Now here comes a serious idea that would work: Why don’t whoever is the decision-maker regarding those bathrooms at the Santa Monica pier go out and buy custom made trailer, with self contained toilets like the “stars” use and when they get really dirty they can just be pulled off site if need be. Then the other ones can be inserted in for while for their duty while the dirty ones are cleaned. That way you don’t have to work within the confines of that small Chickenshack building where you have had your toilets from 1920. There just is no way to make that thing usable for the crowds that you deal with on a daily basis.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shawnm68
40,Commercial w/o being junky,"Street performers, vendors and every different walk of life. Lots to see & do for everyone. It was a beautiful early evening when we visited the peer- we walked the length of it easily. We stopped to look at things along the way & snap pictures. The view of the beach is beautiful from the peer. A must do if you’re in Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/586wendyz
40,Very much for the tourists. The End of Route 66,"If you enjoy the all the tourists & the opportunity to take 10 minutes or 1 hour out of the day to sit & enjoy the LA sunshine.Fantastic day out, I would suggest pass on the Tourist Food Shops & go 100 meters to Big Deans Ocean Front Cafe for a cold beer, great Buffalo Wings & a pretty good Double Cheese Burger... easy listening music with sport of TV",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ceowarren
50,Vibrant atmosphere and lots of things to do !,"The pier gives unlimited views of the Pacific Ocean. The walkway is dotted with trendy cafes, bars and places for souvenir shopping. You could even catch some great performances by street dancers and entertainers. There is a games arcade as well as rides right at the walkway to the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sharmila82
40,An Iconic Place to Visit,"The weather wasn't the best when we visited the pier - rain and wind that dampened our trip. All in all it was an interesting walk but I would have liked to have seen a greater variety of businesses as it was the same thing over and over. The buskers were great - some real talent, that's for sure. We has planned on going to the aquarium the next day but the weather got worse so we didn't.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaPuJe
30,Cool place to visit,"Cool place to visit when in Santa Monica. We stopped here late afternoon on our way back from Malibu. There is only paid parking, but there is a parking lot close to the pier that is for short term (1-2 hours) and is only $1/ hour. Fun to walk around the beach and on the pier. There are rides, but we never went on them or saw how much tickets were. Lots of little booths with food and souvenirs. Great place to watch the sunset. We even had a little seal swim around below us!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leahau

50,Great landmark! Not to be missed!!,"The Santa Monica Pier is an iconic landmark where the famous Route 66 ends!A super cool fun place for all visitors and more so if you have kids.Navigation is really easy; parking at pier is not free; colorful shops all around (see the pictures I posted where in you could see beautiful reflections) and most importantly amazing views directly from the end of the pier or from the beach sideSuggest you plan to spend a couple of hours in the evening and time it in such a way that you could watch the beautiful sunset over the Pacific. Then, you can grab a good dinner in one of the Santa Monica downtown restaurants (Lots of options!)Strongly recommended if you visit the Los Angeles area and especially if want to do something outside the Universal or Disney attractions",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kalyan_peri
50,Great finish to end of Route 66,"Kind of a let down for me. After driving nearly 2500 miles in 17 days and seeing as much of Route 66 as I could in that time, there should have been a band to meet me! I did talk with the gentleman who was working the Route 66 kiosk that day and received a ""Road Scholar"" certificate for completing Route 66! Great little place. They sold a lot of Route 66 material and advertised the road.Of course, the obligatory picture of me at the End of Route 66 sign. (Since I was traveling alone, had a bit of a problem finding someone to take my picture!)The pier was great to visit. Musicians playing for money, people walking around on the pier. The carnival operating. Great view of the Pacific. Just had a great time doing my own celebration for completing the road.I have a number of pictures but there are already so many posted here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/530stanw

Thereafter, grab coffee while strolling down the boardwalk and just enjoying the vibe.Played few games in the park - do not play! They wont let you win!!! Hahaa",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/907pamc
30,Well worth a look,After a walk along a quiet beach the pier was more lively and getting into its stride for the day with all the regular hustle and bustle and street performers etc. Worthy of special note is the little kiosk selling Route 66 stuff (the pier is the west end of the route) as well as a shop it is a fount of knowledge about the route as they guy who runs it is an expert.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Boardslider21
50,My Pier,"This is my happy spot... there is the perfect amount of hustle and bustle, music, vendors, food and fun going on at all times.

We took the Hop on Hop off buses back and forth, and we walked to Venice beach from here, and had such a beautiful day! Takes a full day to enjoy the area, don't rush it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielTripLaVie
40,Amazing sunset with a drop of tourist trap,"Sunset on the pier was amazing, the rides, arcades, artist and musicians either adds or distracts from the beauty depending on your take, the homeless and the drug users are a big negative",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G1359AJleeh
30,Would have been great had it been open!,"Turns out that we turned up on a day that the park was hired out for a private function so no rides for us! The pier itself is a great attraction, plenty of stalls and shops to grab your souviners from at reasonable prices, good picture-taking spots. Can't really have much to say as didn't get to experience the whole pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MattS921207

40,Iconic,"Exciting experience in one of the most iconic places of Los Angeles. The pier is popular with residents and visitors as a landmark that is over 100 years old.

50,Near Perfect,"A friend of mine brought me to Santa Monica on my first trip to Los Angeles. The pier was great. It was a little crowded on a Sunday night but that is to be expected. It is a feast for the eyes and ears to see the attractions and lights and the sounds of the musicians lining the pier. We arrived right at sundown so there was a beautiful sunset as we made our way out to the very end of the pier. It was so picturesque. Though we didn’t stop in any of the stores or buy any food or go on the ferris wheel, we had a great time at the pier and I would visit it again my next trip to Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SUBZEROSKIDD10
50,"Great and fun, but be careful at night","I went to Santa Monica Pier with my friend at night. I've gone there and had wonderful experiences at night before. I still had a great experience. I don't mind the travelers of life without home, but when they have a blanket over their left shoulder, are muttering to themselves and are walking at a very quick pace straight at you and there is no one in a 50 to 100 foot radius to help, run! Nothing negative happened in that scenario, because I ran. If you stay in the lit areas where people are, it's great.I gave one gentleman who is a traveler of life without a home base a dollar after asking him how he ended up where he is. What he said sounded genuine. Now back to the true essence of the pier. Bubba gumps is delicious! The arcade in itself is fun, but one of the employees or owners is high on power and does not know California law, so he tries to enforce what he believes law is when it comes to photography. I politely turned my camera off while I was on his property, but when he came back and said he would call the police after I already did what he asked... that wasn't pleasant as I had done nothing against the law.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zudasworld
50,Exudes the Southern California vibe,"Perhaps there’s no place that exudes the Southern California vibe better than the celebrated Santa Monica Pier. The first concrete Pier on the West Coast, it goes back a century and more – the 1600-foot long boardwalk was opened to the public in 1909.On the Pier’s opening day, the highlight apparently was the running, swimming and boating events judged by legendary surfer George Freeth (you can read more about him in my review of Redondo Beach Pier).Set at Santa Monica’s westernmost point and packed with family-friendly activities, shops, restaurants, the Pier also offers amazing views and a century worth of history. The ramp located at the intersection of Ocean Avenue and Colorado Avenue goes down to the Pier. All along the Pier there are several performers, each one providing novel, often very topical entertainment.Some fun Pier trivia: There actually was a Battle of Santa Monica Bay – not a military operation though – it was a 1939 raid on mob boss Tony Cornero’s offshore gambling operations led by Attorney General Earl Warren.If you are here for the first time, best is to start your visit with the Santa Monica Pier Shop & Visitor Center – you can get maps, visitor guides and talk to friendly, knowledgeable people who are happy to help out with whatever you would like to know or do.Must-have photographs: In 1941 the Santa Monica Yacht Harbour sign was unveiled which has become the perfect spot for that souvenir photograph. In 2009, Santa Monica Pier was dedicated as the official western end of trail of the famous Route 66 – you just have to be photographed here too, right in front of the Route 66 sign! And of course, on the eight-pointed blue and white star with Santa Monica Pier painted at its center, right at the end of the Pier. Apart from these, there are dozens of spots where you can get the most amazing snaps.Pacific Park at the Pier is a full-service amusement park with bars, restaurants, souvenir shops, entertainment arcade and so on. All this set against a beautiful, almost endless Pacific Ocean. Admission to Pacific Park is free – individual rides and attractions are priced in the $5-$10 range.Pacific Park hours vary on account of weather, private events and by season – so it is best to check out the operating times on their website for the date when you plan to be there. However, they are invariably open 11am-7pm on weekdays and 11am-9pm on weekends.Pacific Park offers a selection of 12 rides. Some of the best are:- The West Coaster roller coaster that goes up to a height of 55 feet and provides amazing views of the bay and the ocean as it zips from one end of the Park to the other.- The Pacific Wheel Ferris wheel - The iconic red and yellow Ferris wheel at Pacific Park has been photographed more than any other in the world for sure! The world’s only solar-powered Ferris wheel, it goes up a dizzying 130 feet above the Pier offering panoramic views of the coastline- The exhilarating Pacific Plunge tower ride has two gondolas with five seats each that take riders up 90 feet before the plunge – enjoy the feeling of being almost weightless- The bench-like Seaside Swing seats 16 and sways in a 45-degree arc even as it showcases an amazing ocean view extending from Palos Verdes Peninsula to Santa Monica MountainsOne of the not to be missed attractions at the Pier is the carousel. The Looff Hippodrome built in 1916 is the oldest building on the Pier. The Hippodrome is a National Historic Landmark. Located within the Hippodrome, is the Looff Carousel. A vintage carousel dating back to 1939 (!) it has 44 horses, 1 rabbit, 2 sleighs and 1 goat. Incidentally, the Looff Hippodrome Carousel is where Paul Newman is seen working in ‘The Sting’.The Santa Monica Pier Aquarium is located at beach level just below the carousel – it is relatively small but is well worth visiting especially if you have children with you. Dedicated to protecting the animals found in the Bay, there are over 100 local species on display with hands-on activities for children. Adults and children above 13 pay $5 admission, while children 12 and under get in free. The aquarium is open Tuesday through Friday 2pm-5pm and on weekends 1230pm-5pm. Closed on Mondays.If you are up to it and want to fly through the air, get to the Trapeze School of New York at Santa Monica Pier. They offer two-hour long classes taught in groups of 10 people. Casual flyer or serious aerialist, thrill seeker to couch potato, the school is open for everyone - no prior experience is needed but you do need to be over 6 years old. The school is open 8.30am to 10pm on all days.Fishing is very popular at Santa Monica Pier. You can rent gear, poles, bait and you don’t need a fishing licence to drop a line off the Pier!A day of fun at the Pier can work up a real big appetite. Apart from the Pacific Park food court that serves typical amusement park fare, food carts and food hawkers on the Pier, there is also a delectable selection of restaurants and cuisines. People eat here as much for the views as for the food.Some well known restaurants:- Mariasol Cocina Mexicana – margaritas, tacos and other Mexican cuisine at this Baja cantina with absolutely stunning views- Bubba Gump Shrimp Co – the family friendly sea food chain is perfectly in place on the pier- The Albright – family-run restaurant that offers sea food, farm to table fare, local wine and craft beers- PierBurger – have a burger or a cheese dog on the outside patio of this vintage-style burger place- Soda Jerks – within the carousel building, have an ice-cream soda at this vintage-inspired soda fountainAnd if you don’t want any of this, grab some hot churros from one of the Mexican Senoras who sell them on the Pier, or get yourself some cotton candy and life’s just good!If you are at the Pier, souvenirs of course are a must – apart from the Pier Shop and Visitor Center, there are at least four or five shops selling a range of wonderful keepsakes. You just can’t miss them – get a carousel memento, magnets, post cards, crystal, shells.Stay around at the Pier past sunset for that perfect relaxed evening when the views of Malibu and the South Bay are at their best … if you’re lucky you might even catch the strains of live local music floating in the air, keeping time with the background chorus of the waves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMenon
50,California TOTAL!,"S Monica Pier is pretty cool!For sure is the place more-california around all the state.The park is good, and also have good food.

40,Great to walk around and see the attractions,"This pier is definitely bigger than the average pier in the US. It also features a lot of stores and attractions. You can take a picture on the Route 66 sign. There are also great artists showing their work on the pier. The place can be really crowded during weekends, so be prepared.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gussch1987

50,Woo!,"Oh Santa Monica, how I wish I had more time to enjoy all that you had to offer; rides, shops, food, the rental bikes and scooters, the beautiful water and sand...The beach is free and has plenty of room for everyone. It's great to visit both at night, when the rides and signs are all it up, as well as in the day, when you can lie on the beach and tan or take a swim on the Pacific Ocean. Santa Monica Pier is between the Third St. Promenade and Venice beach. One can start early, starting on the Venice side and work your way you way through all three. That'll be my goal next time Tip: download the bike rental app and Venice app",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Candibuttnz

30,You should see it just once,As the end of Route 66 this is a well known spot. In from Kansas City we had to visit and say we did it. Lots of shops and restaurants. Attractions are fun and family friendly. Best part was watching the ocean from the end and reading the history of the pier. Lots of photography opportunities and safe atmosphere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Firefighter4238
50,"I came to the Santa Monica Pier on the Sunday morning. There was no traffic, and it was quiet.","The Pier is long with many different rides and restaurants. There are also bathrooms. It is windy, but it is not too cold. I wanted to go on the Ferris wheel, but it was closed when I got there. I think that much of the park opens at or about 11:00 AM. The parking at the Pier costs ten dollars ($10.00), but there is limited street parking which is free. One is able to even wade or to go into the Pacific Ocean, although the water is cold and very choppy. I just dunked my feet into the water! The views of the nearby hills, in addition to the views of Venice and Malibu, were all amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TennisStar602
40,No Pier Preshure,We really enjoyed it. The pier can be a very busy place. We arrived late evening and walked past the many shops. We were only going aight see but ended up eating dinner at a Mexican Restaurant at the very end of the pier.

40,A must-see when in LA w/teens,"It was fantastic to finally see in person one of the most iconic LA sites. We parked in public parking place on 4th street and Colorado Ave (across Bloomingdales) maybe it was $12 parking fee. I was surprised how the Santa Monica Pier reminded me of the old Long Branch beach/pier in NJ that I frequented as a kid before the NJ pier sadly burned down. The ambiance made me nostalgic. The sites and sounds of the games and rides were great to take in. We went late in the afternoon and stuck around for the sunset, which was amazing but it was unfortunately quickly eclipsed by the smoky clouds of the horrific wildfires. I also took notice that many locals also go at sunset after work to relax on the beach in their business attire. We did some souvenir shopping and then walked a few blocks up to the Third Street Promenade for more shopping and some snacks. It’s a great outdoor shopping plaza!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gigi0904
50,Nice place to visit!,"This is a iconic place you must visit if in Santa Monica. If Hollywood movies are your thing you will recognize this pier (google it and you will see that the Santa Monica pier was a filming location for several good movies). You will also find several restaurants to choose from, local artists, nice fishing spots and a beautiful beach. We ended up having lunch at Bubba Gump when we were there. We really enjoyed our choice, specially because we like the Forrest Gump movie.Este é um lugar icônico que precisa ser visitado se vc estiver em Santa Monica. Se vc gosta dos filmes Hollywoodianos tem grandes chances de vc reconhecer esse pier (pesquise no Google e vc vai ver que o Santa Mônica pier foi usado em vários filmes).

50,"Early Morning to miss the crowds was worth it, then Lunch at Bubba Gumps Shrimp Co.","Took an Uber to Santa Monica around 0630 am and was pleasantly surprised by the Pier at this hour and the fact that we had time to walk around and enjoy the views without the crowds that appeared later. Was very impressed with the amount of Bikes/Scooters etc that you could also hire from as little as 15 cents per minute. It was a beautiful relaxing morning and then a leisurely walk along Venus Beach. highly recommend, would also have been nice to venture to Malibu if we had the time. Unfortunate part of the whole USA Holiday was the depreciation in the Australian Dollar. Wont think of travelling again to the US until this changes, way to costly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/62christinee
40,Great parking if you get there early,Pier parking was a maximum of $12 for the day on a beautiful winter Sunday. Well worth it for location between the pier and 3rd Street promendae. Both good places for strolling and people watching.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bfindysz
40,A little pier with big personality!,"Us locals are good with it and have been for many many decades, but as a 'tourist attraction' it may disappoint. I can't recommend a meal at Bubba Gump's unless you're drinking the 'tourist kool-aid', but catch a sunset on the ferris wheel and you'll understand why the locals love it so.

40,Fun stop,"Was in LA on a work trip decided to check out the Santa Monica icon. It was a fun stop, parking and getting there was typical LA fashion, lots of cones and redirects to get to the parking lot. 7 bucks for parking was a bit steep. But the pier itself is pretty much what you expect, lots of street performers and “interesting” people watching. I went early so the amusement park wasn’t overly crowded but steadily picked up through out the night. The park was really nothing more that a carnival on a pier and prices were comparable. You simply can’t visit Santa Monica with out riding the pier mounted feris wheel. There was a really obnoxious and pushy seal begging the fisherman for bait at the end of the pier. All in all, I hope make the trip back out and experience it with the family one day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonathanmJ8740EQ

The ferris wheel has to be given a go, and if you are lucky, you will catch one of the magnificent sunsets the west coast has to offer.There are your typical food shacks and snacks and some more casual dining restaurants like Bubba Gumps.Parking is a bit tough on busy weekends, so take an Uber or bike here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sobhanmoshrefi

Just chill, watch the World Go by!Loved it - Really cool go take a look - Go visit a restaurant!And chill :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petermL3976PO
40,Pier-ly good,"Santa Monica pier lives up to all you see and hear about in the movies / docs/ pics etc. It is a must see if staying in this part of LA. Fortunately we had a great sunny day we visited. (December). Roomy wooden jetty to stroll with plenty of stalls, buskers, artists, artisans. magicians, musicians, famous people lookalikes - you name it. Great little fun park. Did ride ferris wheel , great views of Malibu & Venice beach. Plenty of food options, mostly american type fast food but no KFC or Macka's 👏👏 . Even tryed the local popular desert - funnel cake ( over sized donut really with heaps of strawberry topping and ice cream def. made to share.Internal Old style merry go round - piece of history. Also had a Bubba- Gumps shrimp restaurant - which we did eat at on our fianl night in LA. Had couple mojitos at end pier restaurant watching sunset. Enjoyed it immensely, a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mccdzyne
50,Visit after dark,"Amazing food, Busker’s, amusement park and gorgeous views. Make sure you go and visit. Day or night it’s a fun place to be!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sweetaromahbc2019
50,Bustling and Vibrant,"Whats a visit to LA without visiting Santa Monica Pier?Just like in the movies, its busy, with people selling stuff and live acts its got an amazing vibe to it. We went on a Weekend there and it gets full, keep kids close so they don’t get lost.It was an amazing vibe of various cultures. Different smells hit you as you walk along the pier towards the park as people are selling fresh fruit, churros, hot dogs and more.Its got the beach vibe while you hear people on the rides scream on the rides, laughter of children, nothing better to spend the day just chilling and taking it all in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/naushinam2014
40,Family fun at the pier,"I enjoyed Santa Monica Pier with my teenage children when visiting from Australia in January 2019. The pier was exactly as it seems in the movies. The amusement park is nothing special, but we actually had a lot of fun on the rides and playing the arcade games. We were there for hours. January is probably a good time to visit, as it wasn’t very busy. The views from the ferris wheel are awesome. It had a nice fun vibe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NP3003
30,Better viewed from afar,"We visited Santa Monica during the busy Christmas - New Year week, and it wasn’t enjoyable being out and about in the crowds. The Pier is one of those places that’s great to see once, but I don’t think we’ll be going back. The rides were quite expensive to go on, but provided a lovely view out of our hotel window. The Pier has all the usual tacky tourist shops, and dodgy looking food carts. I’m sure you’ll be like we were, and went despite reading all the mediocre reviews.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/973sharynw
50,Mom's First time,I was in Santa Monica for a fundraiser and had my mom with me. On our way home I took her to Santa Monica Pier since she had never been there. She had an amazing time just walking through the stores walking on the pier and walking in the sand. So glad I took her,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/862joycep
40,Good fun for the family,"We came here during the winter from Canada. There are a few carnival rides on the pier and a dine in restaurant on the end of the pier. We stayed for about 4 hours. We did some rides, ate at the restaurant and finished the day with more rides and a final ice cream snack before leaving. The weather was dry and warm which was perfect. The rides are less exciting as the big theme parks in the area but the point for us was to enjoy the scenery and visit somewhere new. there were lots of people but the ride waits were only 15 minutes or so at the longest but only 7-10 minutes normal. My favorite part was the rollercoaster with my daughter, we got a great picture from the automated camera located on the ride. My least favorite part was paying $15 USD to get access to the file online to download it. For $15USD you'd think they would at least email it to you. There were a couple street performers performing tricks on the pier, and some nick-nack booths. Worth stopping in for awhile if you've never been before. We caught an Uber ride here so no info on the parking situation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davemE6955TJ
30,This was mobbed with people.,We drove up from Venice beach to see Santa Monica and walk on the Pier and it was just okay. It was wonderful to see people from all over the world walking by and it was wonderful to see the sunset but not much to do (if you aren't interested in the amusement park).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelbugs222
50,Great Beach spot,"There’s three things you need to know about the pier.1. Parking is not free but there’s different options. You have meter parking and various lots that you can choose from. The lots vary in price, but it’s never anything too crazy.2. The beach and pier entrance is free. The arcade and rides are not but you don’t have to pay for that if you don’t want to. You can just walk around and enjoy the view.3. The food on the pier is very limited and a bit pricey. You’re better off eating at the third street promenade (it’s a 5 minute walk from the pier). There’s a lot more options in different price ranges there.If you’re a local, it’s a good spot to visit every now and then. If you’re a tourist, you have to go and ride the Ferris wheel! 🎡",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itsnancyestrada
50,Great place to watch sunset,"A wonderful place to go in the late afternoon and early evening, watching sunset, wandering on the beach, riding in the Pacific Park, watching street performances and snacking. What a life!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/floraz224
50,Must do!,"Crowded, fascinating, interesting. Take a stroll along the pier, people watch, enjoy the views, take photos...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itsBG
30,Nice Pier but Overcrowded,The Pier is nice - but when we visited it was so busy you literally could hardly walk to the end. Also the musicians were loud and not that great. Maybe it was just an off day - I know it is a famous place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarchelleC
30,Fun trip to do once,"Word of note we paid too much for parking as we were confused and traffic was challenging. There is inexpensive parking down by the water front it’s just a challenge with lots of foot traffic on the streets and unfamiliarity to see the signs.Don’t pay the high prices and don’t pull into a parking place where someone is holding a sign flagging you in without a price being displayed. It’s going to be expensive... learn from us.Have patience and look for on the beach parking. Naturally, we saw this option after we paid $25 to park and started walking along the pier.It’s worth a one time visit to the pier as you get the beauty of the waterfront as well as the amusement park and the odd entertainment. Some artist like the violinist was incredibly talented but some were really oddballs! Fun day for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2flyby
40,Such a cute place,Loved Santa Monica! Not overally much to do there for couples but it’s a nice stroll and beautiful views. Love the small shops and quirky people along the way ! Loved the pizza shop had a good pepperoni 👌🏼,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pr0udmum
40,Fun evening,"My family and I had a great visit. We only rode one ride on the pier due to the amount of time we were able to stay, but riding the iconic coaster on the pier was so much fun. It's something our kids won't soon forget. The little shops along the way were nice to visit and priced fairly decent. We enjoyed the street performances along the way. I could rate higher if the rides weren't so expensive. The pier was also very clean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luvmykids2
40,Tourist Attraction,"The end of Route 66. A very touristy place with quite a few eating outlets. There are also rides, an arcade. Of course there are plenty of souvenir stores.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lazytravel
50,A favorite spot for a Ferris wheel ride,This Ferris wheel ride is a nice and relaxing break with amazing views. The ride is not rushed and you get a good amount of time on the wheel.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BlueSki3s
50,Fun,"Surrounded by beach the beauty of the pier is stunning. Great restaurants, 100 year old merry-go-round, fun rides, and room to run for the kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathyhK9551WZ
40,Great Photo Op,Beautiful views and a lot of options for some nice photos. We took the Metro and were very glad we did due to the traffic. The Pier is a very easy walk form the Metro Station.I enjoyed some of the performers. Some I'm not sure they make any money due to talent level! We were there for lunch and it was not easy to get a table much after 11:30. We did get an outdoor table with a view of the ocean and it was fantastic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buktrvlr
40,Stunning,"What a beautiful place to visit. Even in the heart of winter, the warm sun makes for a perfect morning. Lovely novelty stores and views that go on forever. Ferris wheels for entertainment and food and stores to keep you occupied. And if you're lucky, you'll get to see a resident sea lion!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BevS586
50,End of Route 66!,"This is a must see to check off your list! We visited during the June gloom, but we had fun people watching! There is a parking lot next to the pier. There were several restaurants and food choices on the pier as well as merchandise. You must have your picture made at the Route 66 sign, but there will likely be a line of people doing the same thing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinesc7
40,Great Views,"We had to visit twice !!!On our fist visit it was a bit overcast and the sun was setting.. but the sunset was not a bit lackluster.On our second visit later that week, we spent the day, playing games in the arcade, riding the rides in the park and watching the second best sunset we have seen (Rick;s Cafe Negril Jamaica is the best) ... the view from the Pier to sea and back to shore is simply fantastic.There activities for all ages and all mobility levels, a simply fun place for a day trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CamiddleJm
50,Iconic place with iconic views!,"We had an awesome day there, and the highlight was renting bicycles and cycling to Venice Beach. Even for me, the ride wasn't too far, and the views were beautiful. We rode our bikes back to the Santa Monica Pier just as the sun was setting. Gorgeous!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisacZ1407SX
30,Crowded Tourist Destination,"A quick walk up and down the pier is enough if you want the experience. It was very crowded, of course, but the many vendors selling junk at high prices clogged up the pier even more making it difficult to get through. We got a small cone that cost $7 which is typical of such touristy places. We did, however, enjoy the beautiful sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimGregOhio
50,a MOST visit place if you are in the LA area,"This place is beautiful, you should really visit it if you are in the LA or California area, specially at night the lights are amazing and there are lot of options for food and attractions, you most go",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reviews506
20,Uninteresting tourist trap - 5 minutes is plenty,"This was a disappointment! Very touristy unattractive pier selling cheap items you would expect from such a location. If you want to enjoy the crashing waves on the lovely nearby beach, avoid the constant out of tune noise from a 'music vendor' on the pier. I am sure that local attractions such as the aquarium are far more enjoyable. Worth a five minute visit to say you have been perhaps.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DRS69
20,Give it a pass.,"I was disappointed visiting the pier. Very Honky Tonk.Crowded with lots of junk to buy and eat. Amusement Park might be alright,but I didn't visit that part of the Pier",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MJLRochester_NewYork
30,Touristy,"Touristy but you’ve got to see it. Spend 5 minutes there, then move on asap! Full of rubbish shops and tourist food, but the views of the beach are lovely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foodiespy99
50,Great local attraction,Fun time with kids. The rides are old school and the kids loved them. Funnel cake galore and lots of other eats. Finish it off with a delightful ride on the original carousel.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mtanya2014
30,Worth a Walk To/From,"We went on a tour after disembarking a cruise. We walked down to the pier, where there were fast food eateries, coffee shops, street performers, arcade games and more! We didn’t stop anywhere, just walked down and back and took it in. The views of the beach from the pier are lovely. It’s worth a walk down to have a look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/louisemD2482OD
40,Go to See the Sunset,"It was packed - which does provide nice people-watching, but almost too much. Our favorite part was getting a seat on some risers (which fill up) about 20 minutes before sunset at the very end of the pier looking into the sunset. We watched the sun set while listening to great music. Parking is $7 and usually available right at the end of the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessepisors
50,Pleasantly surprised,Loved walking down the pier this morning. Such a wonderful view of the ocean. The stalls were just setting up and lots of people buzzing around. As I was leaving a group of old school cars were coming into the car park which was lots of fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WeHa98
40,Santa Monica Pier,"Fun spot to visit for the whole family. Ferris wheel, couple of amusement park rides, swing on a trapeze and get caught in midair(safety net and safety harness supplied). Vendors and eats galore. Muscle beach is close by with random feats of strength and balancing to amaze you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/morrisjkm
50,Nice stop,"Nice stop on a recent so cal trip. I was a bit hesitant when we first walked up from the adjacent parking lot, as there was a strong urine smell. Luckily that went away as soon as we climbed the steps up to the pier. I also appreciated that there were a ton of public bathrooms on the pier, so no need to find one in a nearby store. There were lively performers, lots of spots for photo ops, and a few little trinket shops and carts. It was fairly crowded for January, but worth the stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dlinr
40,Always a fun place to walk around,"We enjoyed walking the pier at sunset. Views are pretty and pier animated. It is a fun thing to do and it is free to get there. There are kiosks that sell unusual items like a grain of rice with your name engraved on it. There rides (paid) for grown-ups and kids, restaurants and you can even be an acrobat for a couple of hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SilverBull8t
50,Something for everyone! Amazing at sunset :),"We were staying in Santa Monica and we actually went back to the pier three times for the sunset because it was so pretty! If you don’t want to do all of the rides, I recommend you at least do the Ferris wheel ride around sunset because it was amazing. The color of the ocean is so pretty. We also enjoyed the other rides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/summertimefun1234
50,Capture the Culture of Los Angeles,"Santa Monica Pier is frequented by tourists and locals. Offering am amusement park rides and people watching of diverse people.

30,Tick off the list,"It's super busy which was pretty annoying, the beach is perfect to spend and chill out. The area is pretty cool. Worth a visit if coming to LA, would spend about 1/2 day and get some food here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMystry20
50,Beautiful,Tourist spot. Packed with ppl. But worth going to. Beautiful. All kinds of people. Very “feel like I’m a movie” kind of place. Gorgeous beach. Lots of restaurants on pier. But be ready for ppl trying to sell you stuff.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DevikaTravels
30,Fun to see but nothing special,"It was fun to walk over the pier as it is such an iconic landmark for Santa Monica. Be however prepared for large crowds, loud music and overpriced shops, attractions and food. I much preferred downtown Santa Monica or a walk down to Venice beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/77timow

50,Sister trip,One of the most famous piers in the world. End of the iconic Route 66 which runs from Chicago to Santa Monica. Must get your pic with the sign. Has a small carnival which is a bit pricey. But end of the pier offers a great place to take pics of the Pacific as well as Santa Monica beach. The ferris wheel lit up at night is one of the most iconic pics of the area,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elainep113
50,Great Experience,We enjoyed being on the Pier viewing the ocean waves come into shore. Even though it is a busy place there is plenty room to relax apart from the crowd. Many interesting places to eat in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/448bobc

50,A must when in LA,If you're visiting you have to check out this place. The rides are expensive but worth it. Very instagramable,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheDrDarlington
30,Fun outing,A fun little outing for the kids but it can be very crowded and the cost of the rides is very high for what you get.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaleA130
40,Exactly the same as GTA...,Family visit to Santa Monica & the Pier on a sunny but cold day in December. The temperature was about 10degrees cooler than our visit at the same time last year.The pier was as busy as ever & there were lots of people of the beach in spite of the cold.The same sellers were selling the same tourist tat - you can get everything here.My teenagers kept remarking on how exactly the same it was to Santa Monica pier in GTA.....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bl0ndie72
40,A sunny day in December 2018,"Had a nice visit to Santa Monica and a stroll on this famous pier which has been a location in many Hollywood movie.

Tried to go on some rides but they were very expensive!! We did have hot chocolate and funnel cake. They were delicious!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TraycieB
20,OVER RATED!,"It's a like a fair/carnival on a pier. Lots of people and overpriced! There are so many other piers along the coast, I'm not sure why this one gets so much attention (almost every city on the coast has their own pier). Venice beach is approximately 2 miles south if you walk/ride on the boardwalk FYI.One visit was enough for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kims2529

50,Great street performer!,"I visited the Santa Monica pier on January 2nd and watched a street performer who was performing magic tricks in front of a crowd of about 50. He was a very funny entertainer and his final trick was amazing. He presented at 12:30 and ended at 1. Did anyone else see this? If so, does anyone know the name of the performer? I’d like to give him credits!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jmillae442
50,Fun place to visit,The Santa Monica Pier is a great spot for great views down the beach and the ocean. You can go on amusement park rides and play games at Pacific Park if that suits your fancy. There are lots of places to get a bite to eat on the pier or a number of stores to shop at as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodyt4130
50,worth the visit,"out of lots of overcrowded tourist spots around, this one is definitely worth a visit. lots of street performers and vendors around. great views of the beach and mountains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/895cruzd
30,Beyond Crowded,We visited on New Years Eve and suspect this is an exceptionally busy day as two attempts to get to the end of the pier resulted in us turning around. We would suspect that a visit here outside of holiday or weekends would be best if your timetable allows.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OceanAnt
30,A nice time,"Its a place for a nice time, walking down the pier. You can buy t-shirts and souvenirs, eat, ride the attractions (mostly for small kids) and of course watch the waves rolling in",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stefanf590
40,Busy and fun,"We went here to take a quick look and ended up staying a couple hours.

30,Ride the Ferris Wheel to Complete Route 66 Experience!,"While Route 66 actually finishes 4 blocks back from the beach (at Mel's Drive In), no trip is complete - so the book says! - without finishing off with a ride on the Santa Monica Pier Ferris Wheel.So, off we went to the Pier and it is exactly as it looks on the TV and is exactly what you expect. This is a tourist trap but when you are on holiday, these are the must do, once in a lifetime experiences.We rode the Ferris Wheel - $10 a person - and wandered around for a while. Weather was warm but overcast so we did not spend too long here. If we had been here longer we may have spend more time in the locality.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jags_On_Tour
30,Rather bland and disappointing,The sun shone its California magic on an old fashioned pier. There was some charm and families were enjoying the experience.Very friendly service at the official pier tourist shop.A walk along the beach was quieter.If you have a spare hour in Santa Monica then the pier is a good diversion for a walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pauljD4322DT

30,Crowded but Fun,"The nice thing about Santa Monica Pier is being able to enjoy a sunny afternoon there even in December. It was pretty crowded on the day after Christmas, so I imagine it would be absolutely packed during the summer. It has a fun boardwalk like atmosphere with ""street"" performers, an arcade, rides (which cost $10 each!) and eateries. I recommend the Pier Burgers...yum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/998pamelal

50,A great tourist spot,"After living in Los Angeles for 20 years, I can say that Santa Monica Pier and surrounding areas are a great place to spend the day walking, exploring and enjoying the company of friends or family. There are activities for all age groups to include the beach and small amusement park. My family and friends always enjoy the carnival food like funnel cake... yumm!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FannyMartinez
30,Fun memories 2018,Amazing experience. Parking by pier$10. Not bad. Very crowded on walk its holiday weekend much expected. We took sandwiches and drinks and we ate on the beach when we got hungry saving us lots of money like a soda $4 or water $4. The popcorn truck with churro popcorn by far to die for!! Avoid the overwhelming street performances by acting like I was taking a photo and kept walking lolThe rides looked fun but way to expensive so if you want to spend $30/$35 per person for all rides go for it. We had taken so many good photos and really enjoyed the experience and we can claim to say we have been to the Santa Monica Pier. Yes!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngelJ323

30,Happy busy place,It’s a happy place with so many people coming and going. Got some medallion souvenirs and there was a penny rolling machine. Souvenir shirts were better in the specialty souvenir stores around the city than at the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/893lynettel
40,Great place for a sunset,As far as I'm concerned this is the best part that this area. It was very cool the evening we were there but it certainly is a great place to watch the sunset. Everyone in our group got a bunch of good pictures. Quite a few people in the area I assume most were tourist. Even though it was quite cool there was probably 15 to 20 people surfing. They stayed until a half an hour after dark or so. That also was fun to watch. I would recommend coming here if you're in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/347chuckb
50,Love the atmosphere,The atmosphere is very relaxing. Lots of street shows and quite amusing. Shopping is great and kids loves the theme park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/765wandaw

10,Trashed,"Sadly, this bygone beauty has been destroyed by drug addicts and homeless people. It’s not safe. It’s disgusting. It’s a sad state of our society that these people have no where else to go and get help. It’s certainly not a place you want to take children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iCriticSD
50,Amazing,Beautiful way to take in the views of the Atlantic Ocean and a fun place for kids Easy to get to and enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/558harrietb
30,Come for the seals!,Tourist trap at its finest. This could be and should be so much more. The amusement park area is very run down. There is also some chain restaurants like Bubba Gump. There are also some good old fashioned burger and soda spots also. Go to the end of the pier for your chance to see some seals. We saw 1 guy swimming around. A piece of history being the end of the old Route 66!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhatPatW
50,"Lots of fun, ridiculous crowds",Despite jammed packed crowds I still give the pier five stars. You can't beat the view. The all you can ride option is not cheap but certainly is worth a try given the lines are modest even on a busy day. I wish the F&B options were better but can be overcome by walking to the land side for options.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/s00h0
50,Pretty views,We enjoyed just walking up and down the pier and the sights. There was entertainment along the way and fun little shops. Restaurants were also within walking distance with friendly staff and service.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amorris0709
30,"Quick visit mid Dec, not busy at all","We stopped in here in mid Dec. 2018, it wasn't very busy while we were there. We didn't do any of the rides, they were quite expensive. We walked around a bit, watched some of the street performers and had lunch at the end of the Pier at Mariasol. There are people trying to sell their goods that don't have shops on the pier that can be a but pushy but we just kept walking. It was alright, didn't find it to be anything worth while going back to see again but could have also been the time of year with not a lot going on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Moscato-Mama
30,"looks better from a distance, a bit too crowded",If you are happy with crowds and fancy a rollercoaster ride above the Pacific Ocean Santa Monica Pier is the right place for you. I turned back after a quick look through Bubba Gump Shrimps menu and hearing that the waiting time for a table at 4:30pm on a Wednesday was more than half an hour. Not all the restaurants were that busy but you probably would want to eat at the most famous restaurant on the world famous Pier.Other than walking over some pretty old boards past the police station and jostling past too many people I cannot see the appeal in actually going on to the Pier (apart from 6am in the morning when you can hang out with just a very few anglers).It looks pretty though at sunset from a bit of a distance with the ferris wheel and the rollercoaster lit up and makes for a nice photo opportunity.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ntalabany
30,Crowded but amazing views.,Rides on the pier are a bit expensive but you can pay by the ride. Each ride is about $10 per person. Mostly rides young teens would enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/delgadomv
40,Great place for people watching,Something for everyone on the Santa Monica Pier. Fast food arcades street performers it's a great but very crowded public activity,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/925ericv
40,Iconic place,"Santa monica pier is just one of those places you need to vist it is beautiful day and night but even more so at night when it is all lit up. There is plenty to do and plenty of rides, ice cream, hot dogs, candy floss all the fun of the fair has to offer. They also have a great beach snd amazing sun sets over the pacific ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Globe15
20,"Great stop to watch the fishermen, disgusting restrooms!",A fun place to stop. Bathrooms were very disgusting & gross!! I’m picky about clean bathrooms. That’s the reason for the poor score. Would rather pee in a cornfield.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Triptravelfan2
50,Good place to hang out peacefully.,"It was a good place to hang out. The beach is quite clean and is a favorite among the tourists. The amusement park on the left end of the pier is elementary and you can definitely go for the rides over there. But my focus was the pacific ocean and I spent nearly 4 hours gazing at the beach and playing with the waves that keep hitting you. The sunset is magnificent here and please do stay till the sun sets. You would not want to miss this, if you are around this time. It makes you feel humble.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srivathsa_kn
40,A nice place to spend time with many activities,"The Santa Monica Pier is an eventful place with a lot of activities to spend time. Apart from the carnival, there are street performers, cartoon artists etc. Be careful when you take photos of street performers as they will come behind you requesting money! Saw this happen to some travellers...We also spotted a sea lion at the end of the pier. Seems it is a regular visitor as people feed it with fish.A car park is also available near the pier (at a charge of $7 a day).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zapumal
30,It’s just too busy during holidays,We only spent less than 2 hours in this area. Pier is okay and it’s too pack during holidays. I don’t like the feeling of squeezing in the crowd.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynnonroad
40,Great indie artisan markets,Visited when artisan markets were on. small charge to get in. really good unique group of artisan operators. well worth visiting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Herbie88

30,"Beautiful views, great for kids.","If you have a family and want to see a beautiful beach and ocean view while also keeping the kids entertained this is a good choice. NOT a cheap choice. The few restaurants on the pier are average, and expensive for what they are.Still would I recommend it for a day trip with kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Clay_Ferriola
40,Beach is great. Pier is okay.,The performers on the Pier are worth the walk. At the end of the Pier are fishermen who are fun to watch as well. Otherwise the Pier is filled with crappy stores and chain restaurants. The beach is a better walk. Walk toward Venice Beach and then walk through Santa Monica itself. The Pier is the lesser part of the trip to Santa Monica.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillT4723
30,A bit of America,Was very iconic to go see but I felt the food prices around here were high and long waits to get into the restaurant the amusement park needs a grand attraction. I personally just see this as a tourist trap and is overrated.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/onlybosseats
50,A quick but beautiful visit.,"I only spent an early morning down by the pier, so I can’t give a huge review, but what a gorgeous place. I can see why people want to live here. Crashing blue waves, mountains in the background, and miles to walk with your toes in the sand. I’ll be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daydream810028
50,I love Santa Monica,I had a wonderful time I came out here by myself for some inspiration on a new book I'm writing what a beautiful day it was a flock of seagulls everywhere I looked are the rides people screaming with joy this place definitely holds it down for piers in the South Bay if you guys have some free time I highly suggest visiting the Santa Monica Pier tons of beautiful women definitely the spot for a single guy or vice versa! 😃😎😋,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PercyJackson9
40,Go to see the performers,"we had a blast watching the performers, checking out Santa Monica Beach and nearby Muscle Beach. Even if you have just a bit of time, check it out. Reminds me of the Sunset Celebration on Mallory Square in Key West",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatCincinnati
50,Yoga in the Pier,"From time to time you catch a good yoga class here. Full of vibrant energy, a great place to hang out and enjoy the beautiful view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yogawithdorie
50,Beautiful place,"Very beautiful place, highly recommend to visit and have a walk near the ocean <3 Also we’ve visited Pacific park, from the bog wheel you can see a really beautiful view of city and ocean <3",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mashas838

30,Nice day out,"Pleasant, nostalgic atmosphere. Worth a visit if you’re in town. We took the metro light rail Expo line which was direct and cheap ($1.75).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melinda4061
50,Accessible Challenges,"The wood pier planks were challenging (with many rough bumps) to walk on for hubby who has trouble walking on uneven surfaces. Found the beach boardwalk much easier to navigate due to a smoother, mostly even surface. Enjoyed our Tuesday morning visit as it was far less crowded than our Sunday visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janetbI2665IX
50,What a fun place! Entertaining and fab location,"Lots of entertainment on this pier by a diverse range of people, some very good.Nice, safe atmosphere.Fun to see the beach where Baywatch was filmed.Shocked though that there was an entrance fee to the local vendor's market!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vinden_G
50,It’s iconic,"We arrived in Santa Monica just before sunset and our first stop was the Santa Monica Pier - it’s iconic not only because it is the Pier but it’s also the end of the famous Route 66. What you see in the movies is how it is in real life.The wooden pier is special- it has history, the views, restaurants, the theme park, the souvenir shops and more.You simply can’t miss the Pier",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beechman1
50,Oh you beauty,"This is my first time to US and couldnt have asked for a better start.Missed a turn while going home from airport and ended up coming to Santa Monica Pier , i guess i was lucky to start my trip from this beautiful place.Loved the buzz around and the people performing various things.Great options for food from street food to fine dining places.Weather was great and had a lovely time with family.Awesome place to be alone / with friends and with family as there is so much to offer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/129arunk
40,Iconic Santa Monica,"This is an iconic landmark and once you've been here, you'll start recognizing it in alot of films as this seems to pop up often in movies and TV (Goliath with Billy Bob Thorton for one). It's super touristy so don't plan a lot of time here and most of the restaurants are overpriced and underwhelming, but it's a fun spot to walk on the boardwalk (head to the end and check out the view of the coastline. It's fun in September when they have free concerts (used to be all summer then they inexplicably moved it to Sept-Oct so check listings to see dates each year). Don't waste your time on tshirt stores- much better options at Venice Beach but this is a must-see to just experience the Pier. Definitely head into the merry-go-round building- it's a classic (was in movie, The Sting).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tasker928
40,Beautiful in Decemeber,We headed to Santa Monica after spending a little time in Venice. I ended up parking right on the pier and walking for about 45 minutes. Parking is only $3/hour on the pier.The day was as beautiful as they come and the pier was not terribly crowded on a Thursday afternoon. We all really enjoyed our visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/h_e_tompkins
30,Sunset views,This is a great place to see the sunset and then enjoy some carnivals games at an affordable price or stay a watch some of the street performers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kimmvel
40,Pier out to the Pacific,"Well known for it's position on the Santa Monica skyline, the pier has attractions galore as well as buskers and eateries. Right at the end of the pier I saw a sealion. That's great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chuckofcorby
20,Not a whole lot to it...,"Not sure how this is rated as top attraction as not much to it. Very small and cramped. Restaurants are all mostly fish, so not good for all.End of pier okay but lookout point not exactly elevated.Had a market the day we went on the pier, and they had the check to charge 2.50 to enter.. lot of people turned away on finding out.Overall place to pass..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NigelC914
40,West Coast’s Best Pier,"I have visited many piers in America but none of them were as amazing as this one. This is a long pier on the west coast of America with thousands of people visiting each day. The pier has a roller coaster, a ferrous wheel and lots of other activities to do. You also can take a swim at the beach. One of the best tourist places in Usa and a great photograph spot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foodblogmumbai
50,So much to see and do!,"Brought my 2 teen kids for Spring Break and this attraction did not disappoint. From the gift shops, many dining options, to the ferris wheel all such a blast. And the views.... There were also some music entertainment on the boardwalk. Great vibe and a must see. We didn't know where to park but found a garage for like $20.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/959tashaf
50,Must see,The scenery is so laid-back and relaxing. a great way to start your day or unwind your evening. Also great for photo ops!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Relaxlifetc
30,Tired Tourist Attraction,"We were pleased we had visited the Pier, but it is very old & tired & didn’t feel like we wanted to eat there & happy not to return. There are other Piers along the coastline that have a better vibe & excellent restaurants such as Redondo Beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffreyClarkeCameron
50,End of the road!,My husband and I had to fight some traffic to get there from Long Beach but we where rewarded with a gorgeous sunset. The scenery is great and it’s fun to see the creativity of some of the vendors. The carnival stuff isn’t our thing but it was fun to watch others enjoy the amusements.. The carousel was a treat.. All original and in the original building! Reading the history so happy the pier was saved.. With that I’m an automotive/Route 66 enthusiast growing up near the mother road in Missouri. I’ve been to the “starting point” in Chicago and now the very end.. Now I gotta see everything in between!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shedrivesahotrod
30,Worth the visit,Ride the scooters down to the pier. Worth the visit but dont expect to stay more then 30 mins. Nice safe atmosphere,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/telpage
50,Nostalgia,"Santa Monica is one of those piers you have to visit. The sunset there is beautiful to watch. Lots of rides for the family, on the day we went a lot of the rides were closed but we still managed to play a few games and win a teddy for our very appreciative toddler. We came here 3 years ago and had to bring our baby back to see what we saw. There's also restaurants here, bubba gumps is probably your best bet",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shenizm

50,Santa Monica,"Although electric scooters are not permitted we still were able to enjoy Santa Monica, we just parked the scooters and walked the famous pier, being from NJ it lived up to all the nostalgia.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/818shelleyl
50,Wonderful View,We visited the Santa Monica Pier in June 2018 and thoroughly enjoyed the view from the pier. We had drinks in a restaurant on the pier and shopped at one of the little shops on the pier. It was rather fun and nostalgic and I highly recommend taking a walk on the pier and to walk all the way to the very end. It's really nice at night with all the lights on the carnival type rides and the lights around the city of Santa Monica. We didn't go on any of the rides but it was fun seeing everything on the pier and all the cool lights from the ferris wheel.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/baxterscreativee2017
40,Nice to visit!,"If you are in the Santa Monica area, visit the pier. We visited in the afternoon and found parking in a lot nearby, which was about a couple blocks away. The pier is a nice place to walk on the boardwalk or bike. There are eateries and shapes. The beach is just right there and the sun was slowly going down, so bring a sweater in November. Very nice on a sunny day. If walking back to the car, you can go shopping in the stores and mall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kdjc
40,End of Bike Ride,"This was the end spot for our Four day coast bike ride- began in Morro Bay- followed the 1 and PCH- great ride- seeing the agricultural, natural, beaches and iconic sight of central to SoCal coat line-Great camp sights along the way - get off the 101 and enjoy California's back roads- best local eats in Guadalupe! Cinnamon rolls in Shell beach- body surf El Capitan beach!Tent camp at night and road bike during the day- all the sights up front and in person- safer than you might think - good to great road condition, make this ride one of your must doexpqriences!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/782keithj

Beach is lovely, pier is great with a good selection of shops/bars/restaurants/shopping mall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m4slcsam
30,Nice view of sunset,Good place to see the sunset on a clear evening. The beach is also clean. Good restaurants all over. But there are a lot of weird people around so be vigilant and be safe. There is a nice gift shop also. And yes the Pacific park is nice as well. Kids can enjoy the rides. Not really for adults.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeepDeba
30,The Landmark,"""Eh"" food and amusements, but beautiful appearance of the Ferris wheel at night makes it a Landmark. Te Eiffel Tower of S.M.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardcO4854WL
30,"Great for kids, old hat for adults","THe big attraction of the SM Pier is that it is the official end of Famous Route 66. The pier attractions themselves are typical carnival rides and a few souvenir vendors selling some of the poorest quality junk you can imagine plus the usual hat and t-shirt guys. Young kids will find it exciting as I am sure we did when we were kids, but fir adults, it is a one-time attraction adjacent to a very nice wide beach. The choices for lunch were mostly unappetizing exceopt for the one restaurant at the end of the pier. Not terrific, but tl least they have O.k. food and great service. Enjoy it all once!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlesodonnell
40,Great atmosphere... lots of fun,"The rides were a little expensive, but the whole place was pretty clean. We really enjoyed reading the historical information about the pier all the way at the end.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jondeveaux42

30,Eh. Teenage/child friendly but not so much for adults.,"SMP was NOT what we expected. If you like to play carnival games, this is the place for you,if not you will be disappointed. The stores sold basically the same items - t-shirts, cups, ornaments, etc. with SMP on them. Limited food choices. Nothing to do but walk the pier and have a cup of coffee. We found it incredibly boring and a waste of $ for parking. Definitely a one and done visit for the bucket list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaLovesToTravel

30,Fun,We enjoyed the time we spent here. I didn’t think the Ferris wheel looked like it was worth $10 a person. We enjoyed playing some carnival games.

There is a lot of homeless people who hang out on the peer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChadB410
50,Fun day at the pier,We picked a nice sunny day for a trip to Santa Monica Pier. The rides were great fun with the kids ( we aren’t dare-devils). The old fashion arcade games were worthwhile. The view from the Ferris wheel was amazing. Then walk to Venice Beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adamsE9626CV
40,Loved the vibe.,"Visited this week from downtown LA. I had always wanted to visit the pier and Santa Monica and was not disappointed.For some visitors from the UK, used to big seaside piers you might ask, what is so great and it is a fair question. The answer though for a place without the slot machines and Candi floss is, the vibe, the energy, it feels so safe at night, the interactions and wow the sunsets. There are only a couple of rides but this is a place you visit, just because.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdeWotton
50,Pierfect,"We had a free day in L.A so cause its was 28degrees in Nov in L.A it was the perfect day to walk Venice Beach to Santa Monica Pier. We took the bus down Venice Blvd with our backpacks on started our walk. We love Venice, muscles, buskers, dudes selling CD's, plenty of homeless peeps chilling, skaters, people on scooters, artists and us the tourists. Lots of shops aimed at tourists good deals if you want mementos of your trip. The walk is about 2hrs with lots of stops. Plenty of food but we wanted to eat at the Pier. Lots of toilets too which is great.At halfway mark you will see the rides at the pier.At the pier lotsa buskers, stalls, stuff for tourists and Pierburger which was yummy and filling (vegieburger super yum).We got some pics but we didn't go on the rides looked like more for kids so we decided to walk into Santa Monica where there are lots of shops.

Anyway, the views from the Ferris wheel are SPEC TAC UUUU LAR!!!!!! The Ferris’s ooh ya know what I just realized? Was Ferris bueller named after Ferris wheel? Probably! AHAHAHAHA! I’m such a smartieeeee! The Ferris bueller wheel (see what I did there) is also very well made and not as sketchy as others I’ve been on. The rollercoaster has one rather- oooooooh yikes!!!- painful spot that made my stomach feel like it was being slaughtered, but otherwise it was pleasant.

50,Short visit en route home,Stayed at airport hotel - short walk to bus from Aviation Bus Centre to Santa Monica- takes about 45 mins and costs $1.25 per person for single. You need correct money. Santa Monica pier has traditional fairground rides. Lovely walk past Muscle Beach towards Venice Beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PABT1402
40,Fun Place,"The pier is an entertainment venue that is plain fun to walk along. Some decent eateries, but just people watching and ocean watching is worth it. Has fun tossing fish to a sea lion having fun near the end of the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Afocus1
40,End of the road for route 66,"If for no other reason, go because it's the end of the line for the old route 66. Bustling pier with a carnival atmosphere- best later in the day than early when attractions haven't yet opened.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brlittle
40,Magic walk,"We have been here 3 years ago and we enjoyed again the roller coaster, the views, the end of the 66 route sign.We went walking from Venice to Santa Monica pier and is a lovely walk to start your day.Be careful with the bikes and scooters.Don’t panic! There are plenty of restrooms all over the walk.Enjoy as we did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_mtc_86_1

40,The Warmth and Sunshine are Intoxicating,"The Pier is always worth a visit. The views of the Pacific are beautiful and the tourist shops are exactly that. We stopped to buy a few postcards, to watch the sun sparkle on the ocean, and to breathe in the salt air. The warmth and sunshine are intoxicating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hollyk28
30,Lots of people,Lots of people and very cheesy . kids would think it’s fun very fair like atmosphere There is a fairwheel on the pier,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tbkberg
50,Plenty to do .,"It was a pleasure to see the grandchildren out doors , playing , laughing , screaming , but most of all enjoying themselves . It seems like life time since we last saw them on the rides . My wife and I haven't smiled and laughed so much as we did .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raymonddavies
20,Overrated attraction in Los Angeles,We had a 24hr layover in LA so we decided to hit some of the popular spots with the pier being on of them. The pier was honestly a disappointment. It ended up just being an overcrowded dirty tourist attraction with nothing really memorable about it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheOneTrueGoat
10,Disappointment,We went there at the evening around 11 pm and the pier got closed. The restaurans are insanly expensive and not worth the money. the parking is far and cost around 2 dollars an hour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielF9392
50,Santa Monica Pier,"This was our family’s first trip to LA and the Santa Monica Pier was our first stop. We had an amazing time! Live music, lots of street performers, plenty of vendors, and breathtaking scenery!! Would highly recommend!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TDDRN
30,Ticked the list..,"Visited in oct 2018, its nothing too special, but its good to see the place you see on TV and Movies. Its a place you need to see and visit once, but after that nothing special. Its very touristy. The hot dog on a stick place near by is good. Great place to people watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chopstar87
40,A day out,Spent few hours here. There is parking but must pay meters. Ate at a restaurant after watching the sunset. What a beauty to watch. We did walk in the pier. Reminded me of Coney Island. Rides for kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jayval68

20,Have seen its best days,"This was probably a very nice attraction some years ago, now it just feels out-dated. You get a nice view from there but thats it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saganaki
40,Nice pier,"The historic Santa Monica pier is great, highly recommend visiting as the views of the beach and coastline towards Malibu are breathtaking. A lot of little food stands and street performers make this area a great afternoon stop during your visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CostasDaGreek
50,Must visit historical place,"Nice to walk around and read about the history of Santa Monica pier. Good sea view if you go till the end. Has entertainment as Pacific park, street entertainment. Some do fishing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sheshagirishenoy
50,Beautiful,Great place to go and visit and lovely and for young kids to wonder along. Beach nice too right beside it. Amusements were fun and a couple for the younger kids to go on too. We used UBER would highly recommend great service 👍🏻,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leanneg741
20,Just rides?,Its not like the movies.Seems more like a theme park and there are homeless every where.It was a real let down in my opinion.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Darpell
40,First time visitors,Have always intended to visit Santa Monica Pier and finally got around to it.Had a ride on the ferris wheel and generally enjoyed our morning there. Very touristy but sometimes you just need to be a tourist and enjoy it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikenz2015
40,Sightseeing,The pier is an awesome way to see the Ocean and the mountain view on either side. The big wheel views on a clear day are breath taking. There are many food choices on the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gingergeor
40,Saw the Malibu Fires,We spent an hour here nighttime at the end of a tour of LA. We could see the Malibu fire in the distance with smoke and orange flames. The Pier was a vibrant and neat place to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickyS1382
40,Basic,"Nostalgic pier but needs more food options. Rides , boardwalk vendors, loud.. excellent views overlooking Pacific Ocean and Santa Monica beach. A bit dirty but a fun walk .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sun4FunGuy
50,Another Great Sunny Day at the End of Route 66,"Fun, fun, fun for everyone who loves the beach, the smell of the ocean, the Mountain Views, the amusement park, the crowd from all walks of life,...Santa Monica Pier has it all. Cast a line and catch those mackerels, and with luck, big ones like tunas, halibuts, blue runners... or just stroll around and enjoy the sights and sounds around you, the bicycles, rollerblades, skateboards, surfboards, motorboards, sun lovers, street performers, food and more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/romels2017
50,Lovely,What a relaxing break from the hustle and bustle of Hollywood - a beautiful pier with lovely restaurants etc. Even on a foggy day we enjoyed our visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrincessPanoullie
30,Good for families,An old fashioned attraction offering lots for all the family. A range of places to eat and have fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/highgategal
40,Fun place and great for family!!,"I really enjoyed myself and wanted to stay longer, but it was part of the tour, so time was limited. Its also a great family place. They have rides and also an area for small children to ride, food and of course areas to relax on the beach, and it is well controlled.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GabrielleD357
50,Memories made here,"My husband, son (18), son (9) and myself spent at least 2 hours on the rides with the unlimited wristband. Just make sure you want to ride most of the rides or you can purchase tickets to each ride separately.After that, we looked at the vendors and bought a T-shirt because a bird pooped on my husbands clothes. We walked down the pier and took pictures. It was fun just walking around and “window shopping”.We ate at Bubba Gumps Seafood which was average, but worth it because we had a view of the beach. Afterwards, we went and sat on the beach dipping our feet in the ocean. We did buy a football to throw as well.It can get expensive there but we did make a day out of it. Definitely recommend!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kwootan33
50,SANTA MONICA WEEKEND FROM LAS VEGAS!,"Excellent, laid back location. Totally opposite atmosphere from Las Vegas. Did AirB&B here. Do recommend a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/favb2015
50,Fun LA experience,This is the place you see in all the movies... so you have to go. Nothing really unique about it.... but it is an enjoyable place to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillB468
50,Fun for all,"Typical Fair type of activities here. Street vendors, musicians, rides, and games abound. The Ferris Wheel was fun and afforded a nice view. The carousel was closed - but looked enjoyable too. Bring beach clothes since it's nearby and be prepared to walk a bit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Curious446526
50,Do it! Sunrise Sunset,"I realize locals might discourage a visit to Santa Monica Pier, but as a non local I thought it was worth the time. I visited at both sunrise and sunset and both visits were great. I am saddened to see so many folks who appear to live on or around the beach without shelter, however. That's tough to see and not unique to this town. A walk on the beach or above along the lovely park adjacent to the shore is perfect for people and pup watching and enjoying the view of the glorious ocean. I found plenty of metered parking and just a block or two away from the shore are tons of shops and restaurants. During the sunrise hour multiple classes on the beach were available (yoga & HIIT) for examples. And there are plenty of passionate cyclists taking advantage of the bike lane along the main beach road. Check it out! A simple pleasure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RetiredMJJ
40,Iconic Pier,"The pier is iconic so we had to visit whilst in LA. The pier is what we were expecting and was enjoyable to spend a couple of hours here, plenty of places for food and drink and not as expensive as you might think.We saw seals in the water at the end of the pier, several swimming around and making noises, not bothered by onlookers at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mcglassa
50,"Busy, Exciting Pier","The Pier is a busy place with dozens of options of nice restaurants, street vendors and some rides. It’s also next to the beach so you can easily spend a few hours relaxing, walking around and playing games on the pier. Parking can be difficult, without paying $20+. I’d recommend as a leisure day activity with friends or family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cdl07c
30,OK,"Smaller and older than we expected. Not as many stores, rides or restaurant as we thought. Clean and tidy though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arnoldadventures18
30,Fun,My husband and I stopped here while traveling through LA. Cute little board walk with some small rides. Little shops and restaurants. Lots of transients around. Had a nice time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/serafina6
50,Good spot for a date night.,Went here with a friend. Its a small attraction scene. The ferris wheel is nice though. Its a basic date night scene.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ruentes
50,Mega,Iconic place and a must to visit when you’re in LA. Plenty to do and you can get great pictures of the beach as well,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/calebwtn
50,Shops and beach,"Arrived at the pier, bit chitzy, but some good entertainers. Long beach all along the beach to Venice beach and muscle beach. Quite a few bars along the way. Not the cheapest but what you expect.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carterpe
30,Don’t recommend at night,I used to LOVE this place. Over time it got more sketchy and at night it’s not really a safe place to be. I would say go during the weekend but it’s SO crowded. If you can go during the week you’ll have a great time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicMoraXO
50,Great place to browse and people watch,This was one of my husbands must see spots and we were not disappointed. The beach was awesome and the pier itself had plenty to check out we were also lucky enough to see some dolphins and a seal which apparently is apparently a frequent visitor to the pier,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davideE8708IN
40,Definitely worth spending an hour or so.....,"There isn’t really a lot to see, coming from the UK it’s a novelty that you can drive on a pier! Very conscious of the splintered wooden planks and a 6000lb weight limit per vehicle!Bubba Gumps was good, there is a sign showing end of Route 66 trail, a big wheel and roller coaster that looked a bit naff.But a pleasant hour just wandering up and down and people watching / snapping pics",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshBush
30,"Iconic, but pretty worn out","I'd been excited to come to SMP for ages and had a very different picture in my head to what I encountered! It's OK for a walk and the views out to sea are great, but it's mostly just overpriced tacky souvenir counters. If you're in the area, come down, but don't go out of your way to visit. There's better beach spots in the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/994natalies
30,Too much hype,"SAMO Pier is a lot of hype but fun to enjoy a casual walk with your significant other for nostalgia sake. The sunset was blocked by Malibu when I was there so that was a wash. The rides on the pier are in sad shape and scream for some TLC. It's just a pier and there's nothing awesome about it. Parking is expensive too. Aside from the ""66"" sign, I couldn't find anything memorable about it. I've been to nicer piers in Florida and S Carolina.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ragtoprabbit
30,Worn down and in desparate need of a refresh,"We were disappointed when we brought the kids there. What I remembered and what it is were drastically different. The arcade was run down and filled with broken games, the carousel is in need of some TLC, and I wouldn't get on the ferris wheel or the other carnival rides if you paid me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sprnichols
10,Santa Monica Pier Arcade-don't let your kids near this place!,"The arcade at the Santa Monica Pier is absolutely sketchy at best. It's disgustingly filthy, games do not work and the employees are straight up stealing from you by not giving your money back. 2 employees stole my 13 yr old son's cell phone on the day we were there. How this place is even in business says a lot about the pier itself. Do NOT allow your kids in this place. Pedophiles, theives, and the chance of catching an infection by touching anything in this place are reasons enough!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nataliewZ9034VG
40,The end of the road (Route 66),"So this is the end of Route 66The pier was easy to find and there is plenty of parking but beware some of them cost a lot. We found a multi-storey just off the main road and this was more reasonable, there is ample parking on the pier. The walk down onto the pier gives fabulous views of the coastline to the right and of course the Pacific ocean. Even with the sea breeze in early September I would advise sun cream as it was hot and there is no shade.As the walkway levels off you reach the pier. The End of Route 66 is slightly to the left, and a little further on, just look for the people taking photos. There are gift shops, street performers (we particularly liked the guy belting out his own rendition of a Route 66 song). a fair with a big wheel, restaurants and cafes.There is plenty to do and see and there is access to the beach as well.We went right to the end of the pier and gazed across the enormous ocean.I would recommend a visit there is something for everyone here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toddlerpants
30,It was OK....,"Wasn't as nice as we thought it would be. Granted it seemed to be a very old pier but everything was so old & a bit icky. Granddaughter had fun at the amusement park but, as said, it was all a bit shabby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/720paulinev
40,Everyone has to see once in their life!,Went on a Saturday around noon. Not too busy at all. Had a nice walk along the pier. Lots of sights to see. Saw things that I expected would be there. Great photo opportunities!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N3406OIjulies
40,What changes!!,"I have to tell you, the last time I was at SMPier was over ten years ago (and the time before that was in the mid-80s). Ten years ago I enjoyed the visit, but this time it really has gotten to be so much more of a destination in its own right. The beach, too, is lovely, but you can easily spend the better part of the day enjoying attractions. You of course have to do the carousel, and after that there are fun rides galore, aquarium, arcade, an ocean-front walk, even a trapeze school! Round out your visit with all sorts of food options in the area, it’s a great night out, or a full day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pointlessly
30,Quick trip,It was one of the ‘must do’ trios but I wasn’t that impressedMuch the same as any pierI wouldn’t go back,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ria48
30,Too crowded!,"If you go, go during the week. It was very crowded and touristy. The boardwalk had nice views but not worth the crowd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amygold37
30,A little gimmicky for my taste,"The pier is a little gimmicky for me, with the ""loud"" lights and noises. The ferris wheel is also $10/person, so for my family of 4, it's $40 for a trip around. It's iconic, and you have to visit, but set your expectations low.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I4303EVpaulr
50,Entertaining!,Great place to spend with family and kids as there are many games and a roller coaster and Ferris wheel. View of the beach and mountains aren't too bad either.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/973renec
30,Ok,Sort of iconic. Oceans nice. But crowds are too big and shopping is available in any mall in America. Much better to drive 20 min north to Malibu.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OurFamily312
40,"Spend your time on the beach, not the pier","Iconic! So it's a must-do, but spend your time walking the wide and beautiful beach where the views are wonderful and less commercial. The bike trail is nice for just that, biking -- but for walking, take off your shoes and head to the hard sand by the water. You'll love it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happytarheel
30,Very busy & too congested,"A very touristy area with mediocre entertainment. Carnival quality food, if you must eat... find a restaurant further out from the pier. See it once just for curiosity sake.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CBerna
50,awesome pier! fishing rental on the end on the right side kinda hidden.,"best pier to be at in the la area. we parked on the short term parking. its $1 for an hour with max 2 hour so $2 for 2 hours. right next to the pier not alot of spots but if you circle around a few times and go out and come back in you should find a spot.lots of things to do on the pier, arcade, fishing, eating, people watching etc. just perfect pier and with the beach next to it, cant complain much. it is dated but it is what it is, at night time its awesome seeing it all lit up with the Ferris wheel etc. tons of people all the time.we did do the fishing rental that is at the end of the pier. it is a bit hidden kinda on the left building. very cheap rental but does the job. gives you pole, hook sinker for $6 a person. they also sell bait to and its like $4 or so for the bait. so total around $10-15 bucks to rent for the day. awesome deal for being on vacation and also trying some ocean fishing. really easy to catch the kelp bass if you dont care what you catch. cut up the bait fish into sections and just drop the line down to the bottom of the ocean floor and reel it up a few inches and hold the line and wait for the hits and then set hook and youll have some ocean fish caught!overall awesome pier, good memories. beauitful sceneryperfect weather this november 1-4 2018. avg around 70-75, nighttime was around 60ish. was in tanks and shorts no problem enjoying the cali sun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IWillReviewForYou
40,"Beautiful day, excellent live music, perfect place to be","Strolled out with my companion enjoying the sun, the sea, the surf and the local musicians. The other tourists seemed to be enjoying it, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/834bob
50,Great place to visit in LA,"What a great place to visit, Sandy beach’s. The pier is full to the brim with arcades, thrill rides and restaurants. Felt very happy and comfortable and I would highly recommend this area for s relaxing visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DamienCooke
40,Fun to visit,"My friends and I came here and enjoyed ourselves however it was crowded and felt kind of sketchy what with the number of homeless people. A homeless person actually came in and stole all the tips from a restaurant we were eating at! The view of the beach is nice but besides that, I think it is a little over rated. The only truly amazing part was the Ferris wheel. The view from up there is stunning, especially during sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yarachami
30,Santa Monica Pier,Busy place full of busy people. It was quite foggy during our visit and you had to walk to the end of the pier to actually SEE the end of the pier. Overall fun to people watch and see the entertainment. Didn't go on the Ferris wheel because you just couldn't see anything in the fog. We did enjoy the seal hanging out with the fisher people at the end of the pier. Certainly a must see if in the area since it is used in a lot of movies and shows. There was a crew from E! News doing a segment on Nick Viall from the Bachelor when we walked to the end of the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnlyMeDSW
40,Wheel ride worth the ticket,Wheel ride was the right amount of time with the right amount of stops to enjoy beautiful views and right amount of “ride” time. Really enjoyed it. Rest of pier is cute - worth seeing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rl549
40,Buzzing,"Large pier full of street performers, side shows and tourists. Nice place to stroll with friends and family. A few laces to eat, but better options to be found further into town. Good views of the bay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SB01
50,Fantastic,Wow wow wow. We loved the beach and pier. We would go back in a heart beat. Wrist bands for unlimited rides on the pier and lots of different foods to try,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wizard7mel
50,Calmly pier,It was my first time in Sta. Monica. I heard only in the movies. Good thing is we went there by weekdays. Weekend must be full packed. Fishing is quite okay with locals. It must visit in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cherrylynlarona
40,fun night,we walked out on the pier in the evening there were a number of places to eat and the atmosphere was very laid back compared to the east coast. at the end we watched people fishing.i would call this a kid safe environment with some amusement rides for them. glad we went out,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/78gzaff
30,Morning out on Santa Monica Pier,"First impressions, run down, few vendors closed down, needs some millions thrown at it, great views, we ate at bubba gump which was great, unfortunately quite a few homeless which we came across in all of Santa Monica, don’t give money, give food 👍 worth a visit but only once 😢",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheGambler66
30,The Pier is a Pier Is a Pier!,Nothing to write home about. The only picture worth taking was the RT 66 end of the road sign. The homeless folks really do distract from the crashing surf!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OKbelair56
10,Weed,"Smells of weed everywhere!!! It is madness, only in the richer part of Santa M. you couldnt smell it. Please do something about the hobos on the street, it smells so bad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sally_288888
40,Enjoyable Location for a One Time Visit,"Got dropped off at the end of tour so I could spend some time on the pier. It is definitely a place for younger people and couples. There is a Ferris Wheel which would look great at night time when lit up.Like all these places, they look at bit seedy and garish but that is part of the atmosphere.Quite a few restaurants and cafes etc on the pier. Went to Bubba Gump Shrimp Co Restaurant for dinner (ticked the box but won't be back - see separate review).Glad I went to the Pier but probably wouldn't bother again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/george45
30,A little disappointing,"I was surprised by Santa Monica Pier - I had been told it was a little seedy but wow, it really was! The whole place was surrounded by a lot of homeless or just generally odd people, Pacific Park looks waaay better in the photos and the food options weren’t too crash hot either. That said we had a pretty good afternoon exploring and getting to experience the culture of SM! There was a really talented freestyle rapper at the top of the pier who rapped about my friends and I so that made our day! We rented bikes from underneath the pier and rode out to Venice Beach which was fun.It was probably one of those places I’d tick off the ‘To do list’ and not be worried about going back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stacey13588
40,A very seally time,The pier makes for quite a fun experience with so many people walking its wooden planks. What made our experience more everlasting was the very hungry and demanding seal at the end of the pier. I think its a regular customer who persist to linger around until its fed (you can buy a fish for 50 cents to feed it if you want too) There is a relatively expensive restaurant at the end too but when in Rome... the Ferris wheel always makes a nice backdrop especially at night to all the photos. Lots of smiles and finger pointing from a huge spectrum of humanity and oodles of artists along its length performing their hearts out for a few tips. You'll have a nice time walking the pier... i did :-),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/912arkadiuszw
40,Go for a Walk,"Went there on our way to SONY studio tour. You need about an hour just to walk around, more if you’re having lunch there. Nice views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grandma4920
30,Nothing special,"Many souvenir shops, panhandlers and Artists. Street magician was fun but otherwise nothing special. Parking is always a challenge or very expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/757markv
30,"Busy, busy.","The pier itself is cool, it’s the last stop of Route 66, DUH, so grab your pic with the street sign! But there is A LOT of traffic, hard to navigate through but still a fun experience and you can pay about $8 for a Ferris wheel ride, I’d have you. But the beach is great! The waves and underneath the pier is great. Venture out, don’t just stay at the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/murpmatt
50,Something for Everyone,"Santa Monica pier is a busy place. Tourists and locals mix in a hub of activity. Parking is pricey. At the entrance to the Pier there is parkettes with benches and trees and places to relax and enjoy the views of the ocean or people watching. The actual Pier is just that. A plank wood pier. Women selling homemade churros and local artists selling their work. Let’s not forget all the cliche touristy goods that vendors sell. Trinkets to take home in remembrance of your visit. There is food, drink and music every 10 feet. There is an amusement park. I cannot review that as we did not go into that section. Locals were seen fishing off the side and catching fish for personal consumption. It is a great way to spend the day or evening. Be warned this is not a cheap experience. People are selling something at every step of the way. However, the views are beautiful and well worth the walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Monicad1000
20,Tired,Old pier with the usual cheap run down shops and eating places. Nice views out to see but not much else of interest,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andreaobrien1
30,Strictly for children,This is only good if you have children so nothing wild. Don’t get your hopes up for any exciting games.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MahmoudAGD
20,Nothing special,Just a regular pier with rides. I didnt see anything special.Typical southern california pier. Shops restaurants rides!Free entrance easy access to the beach and parking lots.Walking distance to Venice Beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/657rayk
30,Typical tourist trap pier,Nothing special. My family wasn't impressed. My two boys (15 and 17) enjoyed watching the musicians playing for tips. We made one lap out and back on the pier then left. Heads up: the rental scooters aren't allows in the Santa Monica Pier area so I would skip the pier if you are staying in Venice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markbP2951ZT
50,Fun to roam!,"The Pier is a great place to just walk around. There’s a few souvenir shops that you can buy clothing and trinkets, food places and even performers putting on some type of show. When it’s sunny out, you can see all the way up to Malibu and down to Venice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ffraioli
50,Pleasant evening,"Went down here in the evening for a look around & spent the whole night till late because there’s so much to see & do. There’s restaurants, rides, shops galore, people fishing off the pier & with all the people it was a good atmosphere.Bought several souveniers as the prices were good.We had a great time & anybody staying in Santa Monica really should pop down for an evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sandie-mitch
50,A lot of people,"This beach is full of different people, a lot of things to do especially in the summer. Good beach to go with friends",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tristanjonez74
50,Awesome place,"The end of Route 66 is there and you can see this marked. The pier offers a great ocean and beach view and you can shop,eat, play around. The ferris wheel is one of the best things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RaduS90
30,Nice,The pier is dirty the pigeons dropping bears a pungent smell all over the place would never recommend to wait change clothes underneath it ...apart the beach is not very tidy !Would rather love to be at a nude beach😉,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AadityAHaryanA
40,Carnival Fun!,"Even thought the weather wasn’t great, we had fun on the Pier today. There is a lot to see and we enjoyed the carnival like atmosphere. I’m surprised that the vendors are allowed to sell fruit and churros all along the walk, but they wouldn’t be selling it if people weren’t buying it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HomeBaseAK
50,Tick it off your La list,Iconic board walk.Good to see Santa Monica beachDrive down the board walk for parking cheap compared to surrounding areas to park.Lots of tourist shops and nix naks.Rides are going most of the timeWear a hat not much shade.Few places to have food.Entertainment from buskers.Tick done .Worth a look,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deesimone
20,"Iconic Landmark, degenerating tourist trap","Considered by many to be a Santa Monica must see location, I wouldn't make any special effort to get there. Yes, it's busy, plenty of tourists tick it off their itinerary, but it's got little more to offer than over priced souvenirs, low quality, overpriced food and a fun fair that has seen better days.If visiting by car, seek on street parking nearby, as the parking lot on the approach to the pier is busy, cramped and expensive.On the pier, Pacific Park amusement park has a few rides, including the rollercoaster and the eye catching ferris wheel, which costs $10. The selection of rides is very limited and many were out of service, plus some are suited only to young children, which could be a good thing for some but doesn't offer much value for money if you're to opt for the unlimited rides wristbands (these can be bought at a 10% discount online, costing about $30. Worthwhile if you are to ride several times, but could be a false economy if you get there to find little you're interested in or operational on the day)There are also games arcades, which my wife considered 'retro' in character, but I would simply describe as dirty and run down. We, with our nine year old, enjoyed some skee ball competition and liked collecting the prize tickets, but don't get lured into this futile reward system. You need huge numbers of tickets for the lamest of prizes, so play for bragging rights and move on.There are numerous buskers and street artists along the pier. Some display talent, but most, the 'musicians' particularly, are of little consequence, merely trying to get a share of that tourist revenue. I'd prefer to support them in their efforts than the souvenir and fast food outlets, but it was all fairly lame I'm afraid.On a positive note, the beach area was the location for scenes in Fletch (!!!) where Fat Sam plied his trade, while Gummy was beaten up by the cops under this very pier. No? My wife wasn't impressed by that information either. Sadly, those movie scenes, of homeless drug addicts sleeping on the beach, reflect an all to prominent reality. I can't assume they were drug addicts, but there is a huge homeless presence in the immediate vicinity. When I last visited this area, over a decade ago, I encountered many homeless people around Ocean Avenue, but their numbers have increased exponentially and while we had no trouble from anyone, we did have to pass a few guys on the beach promenade, with evident mental health issues, ranting at nobody in particular, which was a bit unnerving and certainly scared our young son.The pier really has little to offer other than cliched photo ops and while it looks more exciting lit up at night, you may also have to walk through dark areas when leaving, so know where you're going and remain vigilant. Admittedly I didn't feel as intimidated while visiting as this review may imply, but in brief I feel this is a failing attraction, which did little more than to highlight to me how society is increasingly failing it's most vulnerable members.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Johnm1922
40,Fun and worth seeing,Fun and worth it at least once. Roller coaster is a classic and fun but tame enough that it's not too scary for kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindseyOneil
40,Lovely couple of hours,"Nice pier with rides. Places to drink and eat and take stunning photos. The burger place on the pier. Is very nice, staff were a little slow though",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HandSi34
10,Awful,"Dirty, lame, busy and full of drugs. This was, by far, the lowlight of our Southern California vacation. A complete waste of the $14 parking fee. We got out of our car and were greeted by a drug deal happening directly in front of us. We ignored them and walked on, looked toward the beach and saw close to a hundred homeless people sleeping all over the beach with their belongings spread all over the place. Not a safe feeling. We walked into the pier and it was the same story. We finally turned around after about 5 minutes, never to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/804michaelr804
40,Nice but touristic,This is a nice place for a walk and to enjoy some games or carousels. It was packed when we were there and it was also a hot day which made it a bit exhausting to walk around. We had a good time and enjoyed the hour we spent at the pier. Many small shops and stands along the pier where you can buy souvenirs. There’s also a lot of restaurants if you like to have some food while visiting.It's for sure worth a visit and there's also a large shopping mall across the street when you had enough of the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joky80
30,Average,"This was nothing like what I was expecting. Don't get me wrong, it is a beautiful pier but it was way too crowded. It was over 100 degrees and very pricy as well. Someone had gone missing in the ocean the day I was there and complete chaos broke out. Not sure If I would return again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellbelllll
50,It’s for tourists but worth it,"If you’ve never been to Santa Monica, visiting the Pier is a must. Lots of options for food and entertainment as well as walking on the beach or renting a bike to see more of the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/run4fun122
40,Very nice place,I went in the night (10pm) and it was full of color and all the attractions were very full with people.It is a nice place to take some pictures and buy some souvenirs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luisfpim
40,Nice spot,"It’s a nice spot to visit, especially if you can make it outside of main tourist hours or for sunset views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CosmoExPat
50,Love love,Loved it here there’s all kinds of souvenir gifts and beautiful views and scenery as well as the beach is literally just a walk down a few stairs. Absolutely loved it here!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicagehlbach
50,Full of lively people.,"We went there on Sunday afternoon as we decide that this is one of the places to visit since we are in LA.There were eateries such as Bubba Gump Shrimp Co and few others along the pier. Lots of souvenir shop dotted along the pier for you to grab something. You can also try one of a few ride at the Pacific park.The pier has everything for everyone be it young or old. You can just marvel at the ocean or just people gazing, it will be just as fun.The pier was crowded as it’s Sunday. We manage to buy some souvenir before heading back. Nevertheless we were had a great time there and thoroughly enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stomping
30,"OK place, but better options","After dodging the homeless folks, (no we're not heartless, but it does distract you) and arrived at the pier, we found very limited things to do. Prices for most things were through the roof. Decided to go into town for lunch, but again prices were almost prohibitive. 8 piece sushi roll going for around 20.00, lunch 20-25$ per person. Decided to head over to the Sherman Oaks area for lunch instead, (sushi row).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kjake2004
50,WALKING OFF A LITTLE JET LAG,"An Uber trip to the Pier after a 14 hour flight from Sydney and the sound of the ocean with a cool breeze was beautiful. A definite must visit for some time out. All the usual tourist additions, souvenirs and a singing Donald Trump. Don’t stay too long, but go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulaRoumanous
40,Good,Great way to spend the afternoon. Have always heard of this place so definitely had to stop. Lots to see and really pretty views of the ocean. Lots of places to get gifts too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/layla328
10,Lovely old pier but very disappointed with the restrooms,"Great visit to the pier but try not to use the toilets as they were smelly, unkept and very depressing. Only 3 out of 5 toilets were in use, two had a old ripped handwritten cardboard sign stuck up with gaffer tape, to say not in use. The smell was awful both male and female. Surely Los Angeles can do better than this? Do they care about all the tourists that flock from all over the world to see their beautiful city? Such a shame because the pier was a nice atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samsamdarlin
20,The actual pier is a disappointment,"The beach itself is amazing. The actual pier is a dissapointment. Some ok street performers but some homeless guys stomping their feet stood next to a boom box is not what i would call quality.The shops here are tourist traps and everythings here is to take all your money for not much im return, it is also alot smaller than expected ... it has maybe 10 stalls and 10 shops/restaurants and thats all.The actual beach though is great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnsT9034VU
50,Day outing,Great place for a trip whilst at the beach. Bubba Shimps restaurant is at the beginning of the pier and a great place to have a meal and take a photo or two.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ahtrains
50,Great Spot For All Ages,"Spent a night here while visiting relatives for a few days. We enjoyed the ferris wheel and found the $10 pp for the ride was worth it. You see the ocean and the pier all the way to the end which h is the furthest westerly point in California and the very end of Route 66!There are a number of restaurants right on the pier. I think if I had it to do over again, I'd choose one instead on the street that runs parallel to the pier (see separate restaurant review).This is a great place for all ages with plenty to do for young and old alike.There are lots of photos explaining the history of the pier which are interesting. If you have found this review to be helpful, kindly let me know by clicking below.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BahiaDelray
50,Santa Monica Landmark.,Always enjoy going to the pier to eat and take in the breathtaking view of the ocean. On a clear day you can see Catalina Island. Cali at it's best,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sworrels
50,Beautiful place,Love Santa Monica pier. So many great places nearby and absolutely beautiful . Didn’t do the rides but hung out on the beach for awhile. Everyone needs to come here at least once,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/697benjc

40,Nice pier at Santa Monica,Nice to walk around and then have something to eat. The original muscle beach is located next to the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelWorldMap
20,We went late at night,"Found it underwhelming but could've been because we went for a walk there at midnight. Lights were on but nothing open, really just a Ferris wheel , a few carnival sides and restaurants. Not an overly large pier. They don't recommend to walk their late at night and probably best not to but even with a fair number of mentally unstable homeless, we felt safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Outbax
50,Fun for all,There’s quite a few things to do at the pier. We went on the rollercoaster and it cost us $20 for the both of us. Lots of places to eat and great views of the ocean,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helengV4958AX
10,Flea markets and Junk Food,We missed this during the last trip and went this time. Took forever to get there from Hollywood. The pier is lined with flea market vendors and junk food. Was absolutely packed with mostly foreign tourists on a Thursday night. There is no security or police presence and a mentally disturbed homeless person was following us.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeGriswold
30,living off its position,because it is so visable a lot of people put it on their list of things to do. Once you have done a lap you realise that you could have invested the time in something else for a better return. The rides are old but not in a retro or nostalgic way. The food is the same as places up and down the coast (or anywhere realy) but they are busier and more expensive. Go and get you picture but dont expect it to be THE thing you do that day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kelly_AndrewM_13
40,Loved it but expensive,"We have stayed for 9 nights at Santa Monica and each day and evening we had a walk on the pier.We just loved the constant buzz and atmosphere and plenty to do here. However, it's extremely expensive as expected. We expected that so didn't matter too much. Pacific park is massively over priced for what you get. It still didn't stop us having fun and the sunsets on the pier are just beautiful. It's well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simontR2320TT
40,Wonderful atmosphere,"Walking along the pier there are a lot of musicians and even magicians. We had a great view over the city from the ferris wheel. Try out the Mexican restaurant Mariasol at the end of the pier, it was amazing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/293katrinr
40,Simply amazing,"Whenever I come to santa monica, I should have a walk on the beach. It is really awesome especially during early morning or at sunset. The place is really charming.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Resort676671
50,Great hang out place,"If you have nothing much planned, head up to the beach. There’s a Ferris wheel and a roller coaster to enjoy and a few good food outlets in that area. The view of the sea is breathtaking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BalpreetHarvi
20,A must see you don’t have to see,"No good restaurants, lot’s of noise, bad street crap to buy, and trash. For tourists only - hardly that even.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thomashauk
50,A great place for a date or to hang out with friends,"Oh my god being at the Pier was so nice and refreshing. Driving from LA there, the clouds got heavier and it got a couple degrees cooler when we went but it still was so much fun. They have some cool rides and good snacks and being above the beach such a different experience. I want to go back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KpopEnthusiast
50,The perfect setting for fun with a great vibe.,"Located on the coastal side of the big city, LA every tourist must make it a point to experience this spot. We stayed at the Residence Inn, LAX airport and took the Big Blue Bus #3 to Santa Monica. Streets around the pier are simple a sight to take in with people enjoying food and drinks on roadside restaurants and cafes. Take time to spend a good hour or two at the pier. The scenic beauty by day and the vibrancy by night must be experienced. Rides and attractions for kids to enjoy and lots of shops dot the pier from food, music to souvenier shopping. Dont miss this attraction for anything in the world ! the weather in October is just perfect to be around here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheraln2018

40,Relaxed atmosphere!,"Ubered out from West Hollywood to The Pier which took 40min with minimum traffic.Nice atmosphere but lots of odd people hanging around. Just got to be on guard. Security screen checks to get onto the pier which meant lining up. Rode on the roller coaster & swinging ship, played a few games. Got to see a friendly seal which was great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaD394
30,Not What you Expect...,"Considered to be one of the tourist places to visit when in LA, though it was rather disappointing. There are some restaurants and the amusement park that will entertain you however there is also a considerable amount of homeless people in the area. This is a very sad and disappointing thing to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theranp
40,We enjoyed it,"It's not the most sophisticated of experiences and there is the odd odd person hanging around (but no more than the rest of LA and no sense of being unsafe) and we enjoyed it. People selling tourist stuff (fine by us because we're tourists), mid range eateries and take away food (we had some and it did the job just fine). All up worth an hour or so walking up and down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gonefishingx
20,It was okay,We visited on a beautiful day in October and a lot of places were closed and the Ferris wheel was fun but not worth the money. If you’re in Santa Monica it’s worth a visit....but it shouldn’t be a destination.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/airykah
50,Worth the trip!,"This was my first trip to California. I was told if I visited Hollywood to be sure and visit the Santa Monica Pier and Venice Beach. These two attractions are just a short distance from Hollywood. The Pier and beach is beautiful! There are plenty of rides, games, and food to enjoy. And there are plenty of souvenir vendors. You also can poise for a picture in front of the Route 66 highway sign - the end of the line for this historic highway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rossgool
50,Super FUN,"The pier was an excellent idea. You can take in the sunset, watch for whales or dolphins. The Ferris wheel is so neat lit up at night. Fun for all ages. They have places to eat, ice cream, candy, even a man playing a guitar.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/31travel06
30,Did not live up to expectations,"As a British couple visiting California for the first time, we had heard great things about Santa Monica.Whilst the town itself was quite nice to wander around, the pier was not very pleasant at all. Brighton pier back in the UK is much nicer than the slightly dirty, packed full of tourists pier that awaits you in Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KateN621

40,Fun Place by the Beach,This pier is really packed by tourists and locals alike. Right there by the beach a long alley fully loaded with all kinds of shops and restaurants. In addition to that there is a riding wheel and a roller coaster. The scenery is just perfect.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OsmanB511
40,End of the Route!,"We came to the Santa Monica Pier since it was the end point of Route 66 and we finally finished the whole Route! Nice place. Very touristy. I was a little annoyed with the ""Straw Nazis"" trying to get people to stop using plastic straws. We have personally reasons why we need them. Anyway, tons to do and spend a full day! Wish we got there earlier. Was impressed with the street vendors and small booths. Stay out of the shops, the booths have cooler/similar things for half the price. I would pay the $14 bucks for parking (cash only) to save the hassle of driving around since the whole area is crazy busy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Princeton1212
30,Not as nice as Santa Cruz pier,"I felt that the shops and kiosks sold the same items over and over. There is a section with rides; however, we did not visit this part. Very crowded (went on Sunday), but the weather was perfect and the Pacific was amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Katz2christine
50,Lively place,"You just have to love Santa Monica Pier! Such a fun experience! It is usually crowded, the views are fabulous, there is always something going on. The historic carousel, the amusement park, the restaurants - or watching the fishermen, and the do,Phons and seals off the end of the Pier.... all good fun. Some fun performances along the Pier. I always loved to come back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chopstickmama
40,Fun on the Pacific,"I've been here many times. There's something for everyone. You can spend time on the beach. Or you can stroll along the pier and shop for souvenirs, crafts from vendors, performers, or try food from quick serve restaurants or sit down restaurants. There are rides for kids and carnival games. There is an arcade. It's a great place to people watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/unowen1
50,Perfect sunset,The pier was crowded but still a good vibe. Clear sky with an amazing sunset and lots of photos. Plenty of food and attractions or a nice beach to walk on.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paul0652
30,Fun trip,"Went to spend some time with family on a southern California visit. To be honest, this place is very overrated. It's not much to see on the pier itself. A few shops here and there, a few performers along the pier. Tgere are a few amusement park rides and that's it. I'd rather go to Santa Cruz boardwalk. Much more to see there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gilcro
40,Love the nights on the pier,"So much activity mass of humanity,lots to do and see.Lots of buskers and people selling things.Many food choices and so many rides to enjoy.A must visit when in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rickcardo
50,A must see,"When in Santa Monica/LA, how can you not put the Pier on your list? A fun place to visit, very touristy and lots of people (if you like crowds), and always a variety of live entertainment on the Pier. The beach is one of the better ones in LA, and parking is fairly inexpensive compared to other local parking (around $10). The souvenirs and restaurants are very high so you may want to eat somewhere on Ocean Ave, although anyplace in Santa Monica on near the water is expensive.The carnival is fun although it is geared towards youngsters and we were traveling as an adult couple, so not much to do there.Tips: Wear sunscreen! There is no shady spots on the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/594stevev
40,Beautiful Place!,Really loved the atmosphere at the pier. The views were pretty and a lot of history there. Rides were way too expensive which is why I only gave 4 stars. Ocean was extremely cold but that was to be expected. Overall my favorite thing in LA! Expensive parking and it’s cash only!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brooke5504
40,Must-do if you are in the area,The Santa Monica Pier is a staple of California with many things to do. There are multiple food/drink options with many shops along the pier. There is the occasional street performer that are always fun to watch (and some were quite good). Parking was a breeze - drive down the pier and you can park on the left hand side right above the beach. That allows for quick & easy access.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaGallivanter
50,Great tourist spot,"Did a day trip here from down town L.A. very easy to get to we caught the light rail system expo line stops right at Santa Monica only 5 min walk to the pier. What a great place for families couples etc, plenty to see with street performers and heaps of places to eat, there’s also lots of seats along the way if want to sit down and just take in the atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heizzy

40,Nice and famous,"You can see this place in so many movies it is definitely a place to visit in LA. Santa Monica is a nice neighborhood in general, while Hollywood is ugly. The only downside of the pier itself is there are a lot of birds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/csipety
40,Nice evening out,"I visited the pier as a simple something to do as I was staying in Santa Monica and had only landed a short while beforehand.It was well worth the visit, lots of fun things to do/see; arcades, rides, eateries, street performers etc. as well as amazing views at sunset!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seanbucknall
30,Strange But Interesting...,This pier is home to some strange street performers. Kinda like a knock off of Key West. I thought it was fun. Looked like the families were having a good time. Was pretty crowded as it's not really that long from one side to the other. If your in Santa Monica it's worth a visit just to see who's performing....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChalieB_99

30,Kids enjoyed it but lots of rides not operating,Our family of 2 adults and 4 children visited the pier today. We purchased the day passes for the family. We enjoyed the rides and the children had a great timebut it was disappointing that several rides (4 that I counted) were not operating. Still a fun morning and it was nice that no long queues for any of the rides.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sculley2016
40,Very nice place to visit and explore,"I visited here tonight to have a drink and watch the sunset. The pier is actually quite large and I could have stayed a lot longer.

50,Fun time at the pier,"Santa Monica pier is a LOT of fun! A beautiful location and lots of fun things to do. We rode a few rides, checked out the souvenir shops and had lunch at Bubba Gimps. I had to visit the pier to add it to my Route 66 stops. Easy to get to off I10.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/990dickp
40,Fun but pricey,The pier is awesome but be prepared to shell out a lot of money! The wristbands are the best option but it was over 100 dollars for our our family of four. The food is standard amusement park food. Crowd gets a little interesting at night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OneManWolfpack658
10,Sad and dreary,Another overhyped LA experience. Nothing to redeem it. A stream of bored families looking for excitement. No decent eateries. No beers. Dirty and dated. Makes Eastbourne pier look positively amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VW57
40,Must visit if in LA,"this pier has all what you need ..wonderful beach, rides for kids and adults, only problem is parking over the weekends",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WantTravelAtBest
50,Beautiful,Please go to the beach! Enjoy yourself and ocean. There is population of.homeless there that you may see naked if you go under the boardwalk! Just a warning!Make sure you walk around the beach and enjoy the waves!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmaxson
50,A must-visit place,"Love this place, probably because I saw it sooo many times in a lot of movies! I really enjoy the atmosphere and the sunset!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jazzlove15

50,Great place to visit,We went to SMP on a very busy weekend and enjoyed the experience. Great for souvenirs were you are not ripped off and plenty of good places to eat. The deck of the pier is quite rough in places so you need good comfortable shoes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackK311
50,Like the movies,"You can't go to LA and miss this famous attraction. Beach views, entertainment, food, live music.A city icon where the world meets",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArgentinaWC
30,The people are the best part,I’m not sure I would go as a carnival but I enjoyed seeing people have fun. Food was available and what better place to see the ocean meet land. We came on a tour bus and I’m not sure without the surrounding access to Venice and Malibu via boardwalk would it be worth the drive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Avakelly
40,Great weekend getaway,Came here on a weekday to avoid a big crowd and took my kid to the pacific park. There are arcades too but we somewhat finished everything in half a day but it was nice strolling around the pier. Ended up walking by the beach and didn’t realize how big it is. I would definitely go back and try other restaurants,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jomama_Fosho
20,Not what it used to be,"I visited the Santa Monica Pier with my husband on a Friday afternoon before the Beck concert at Hollywood Bowl. I visited on one other occasion - 15 years ago before meeting my husband. This was my husband's first visit. I remember Santa Monica and the Santa Monica pier being...nice. As a young adult, I thought ""wow, it would be neat to live here!"" Well, things change, and 15 years later, I thought the pier was the pits! What happened to Santa Monica?! For that matter, what happened to the rest of the LA area?! Santa Monica is not a place I'd want to hang out in, and it definitely isn't a place I'd want to live. This area has gone so far downhill. Homelessness all over, and because of all the smog in the area, we couldn't even see off in the distance out to sea. I grew up in NJ and I absolutely hate the Jersey Shore (except for the Cape May area). Well, if I had to pick between the Jersey Shore areas outside of Cape May and Santa Monica, give me the Jersey Shore any day. To us, there was nothing special about this pier, and we have no desire to visit again. So sad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mdgrl79
50,To be seen !!!,"I went here to see (and get a pic) the end of Route 66 road and I was surprise of how many people were there.The place is fantastic and honestly even the prices of souvenirs and food are quite standard ( you're on TOP places!! ) I spent 3 hours walking around and taking picture , really a TOP One along with Walk of Fame . ( they have also wifi for free)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mauro1972
40,Pier,"Very crowded, Saturday and Sunday crazy busy, go during off times is way and off season, way better then",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/77mdc19
50,Solo Travel to the pier,"If you love the beach this is a must place to visit, lots going on here you will love it day or night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LBWanders
40,Somehow overcrowded,Beautiful sea front with lots of entertainment programs and visitors from all over the world. Somehow overcrowded which is understandable. The view is amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steelriver2014
30,Very crowded,This place was very crowded. There were thousands of people. The parking was horrible. The parking is not expensive but the lines drawn for the cars to park were so small that only a mini car could park. If you have an SUV and park you will not be able to get in and out of your vehicle.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShellyShell2014
40,Its a stop you must make in your travels,"The end of Route 66. Many take pictures at the site. Amusement rides, aerialists, sea lions, great beach, concessions, bubba gumbo and street performers are but a few attractions. Nearby shopping for all price ranges. Beautiful streets and the metro link connects with most areas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveller_360063
50,Unexpected Treat,"From the distance, you can see a ferris wheel and amusements, so was pleasantly surprised when the Pier also included a Boardwalk Type atmosphere, very typical of Jersey Shore Style. Much more classy than Venice Beach, down the road.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lanes130
50,Cool!,Loved this Pier! there was a lot of food to choose from and the shops had a lot of cute stuff! plus the rides were amazing! i loved the ferris wheel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/graceexplores
40,Nice walk,Lovely walk along the pier but too many buskers for my liking made it very noisy and some of them you would pay to stop! The area is lovely and the walk between here and Venice beach was lovely and well worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shaz3004
30,"""Young again""","Been here twice but didnt really enjoy it the second time round, very old school rides, makes you feel young again and back in the 90's, the kids will enjoy it. its worth a visit once",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Moen03
40,Busy,"Worth a stroll along the pier especially at night - gets very busy but plenty going on. Fairground rides, street food buskers etc etc",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Howard-Moon
40,Santa Monica Pier,"We decided Saturday afternoon to take a drive to Santa Monica Pier just to get out of the house and see something new. We weren't thinking (of it being Saturday night by the time we arrived). It was a little drive as we were coming from Huntington Beach and there was quite a bit of traffic.So for the traffic situation alone, I'd maybe recommend going on another day of the week. Unless you don't mind sitting in long lines that don't move very fast and don't get aggravated when it takes you a couple of times to make it through a light.Everything else about the pier and our adventure was pleasant, I'm just not one of those that do very well sitting in bumper to bumper traffic feeling stuck.If you go past the ""Lobsters"" parking lot and go to the 2nd driveway from the pier, it is actually better parking and cheaper (I learned this from the parking attendant at Lobsters). This will take you to a parking lot located under the pier where there is plenty of parking. It is $14.00 per car to park there.Once you park, walk to the pier, and you have arrived. There are vendors all along the beach and the pier, selling a variety of items, from food, snacks and drinks, to novely items. There is also free entertainment along the pier. Singers and guitar players, and mimes, etc.We walked all the way down to the end, grabbed a pretzel and sat down for a minute before heading back. Overall, we had a pretty good time and it didn't cost that much. Just what we spent on the parking and the little trinkets we purchased from there. I'd recommend seeing the Santa Monica pier if you get a chance and it is fine for any age group.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/surfsideseohb
50,Plenty to see and do here.,"Took the Metro from downtown to Santa Monica which is just a short walk to the pier. There's plenty to see and do here, lots of entertainment, plenty of good food outlets and is not to be missed on a trip to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luk12017
50,"Lots of shops, entertainment and food.","Took a walk on the pier after dinner. The pier was lit up as it was dark and lots of people, actually crowded. Was a nice evening and great to go for dessert.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carol_fortworthtx

40,Walking,Had never been there seen in so many movies and shows so I decided to visit nice but very expensive the rides.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/babybubba
50,Wauw,"So many times seen on tv, but in real even Nicer and bigger than tought. Please be aware of trafficjams So feel free to walk on the sidewalk. Lovely to feel the vibe and feel fit. Walking from muscle Beach to the pier Will take you about 😁 thirty minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ilOna2012
30,It’s ok....,"I first visited the pier two years ago and loved it. On a recent visit with family I was disappointed that it was over run with buskers and people selling junk. It was loud, noisy and really not very little kid friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adventureswithshelle
10,Very filthy,"Noisy, filthy and smelly place. If you never visited it might be worth it, but not to return. There are better places to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/678mvi
50,Fun,"It is our first trip to California and we have been doing lots of the tourist attractions, this was really fun. We went on the ferris wheel and got some pretty cool views of the beach. Gorgeous day when we went but we forgot sunscreen, we visited in the Autumn (Fall) and ended up sunburnt.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gabbyaddy
40,Iconic must see,"This is an iconic must-see. The Pier is a lovely walk, though it gets very crowded periodically. The scenery is lovely as you look beyond the Pier in every direction, and especially facing the mountains ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LES420
40,"Durng the summer its the best place to be. Great food, games and sites. Water is fun too.","There is parking near the pier. I suggest getting there earl 2pm at the latest. The children loved the water and the rides. The pier is great for a leisure walk. You might even get to say hi to a pelican ir two. Great from from the end of the pier. Oh did I forget about the fishing, you can walk by and talk to the many fishermen or women out there. You can even get your rod and go for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Road33561
50,A route 66 icon moment.,"With all the weird & wonderful things thrown at you in LA, being a Brit & staying in Santa Monica the pier is like being back home. I'm surprised Piers Morgan hasn't got shares in it. Amazing place well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dougiedo3
20,not kid friendly,I was very disappointed with Santa Monica. I go to LA a lot and try to stay in a different coastal city each time. Santa Monica was crawling with homeless people and smelled like weed. One of the gentlemen kept following us telling me how beautiful my daughter wAs. ThereIs also a railway a few block from the main entrance to the ocean which causes a lot of commotion at night. (NOT SAFE) I will not be staying here again. Manhattan beach is much better with lots of fun shops for the kids,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/457aprild
50,Nice Beach / Pier / Boardwalk,"Must visit attraction if visiting Los angeles area, parking is sometimes pain but manageable. Lot of kids attractions around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ips28

40,Nice pier,Well this place and the beach is much better then Dirty Venice.I would come here again. Pier is nice and also the walk on the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HoffySig73
40,New Discoveries Every Visit,"As recent transplants to Santa Monica we have visited the pier a handful of times already. It's a great spot for a day with the kids: access to the beach, options for food, close to parking and clean restrooms, and friendly staff. Highlights are photo ops, Pacific Park with the rides and games, and buskes and people-watching.I hate to say it, but as with anywhere in the. L.A. area, the homeless are a bit of an issue but for the most part they are out of the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodelagain
50,iconic,it was a must to see santa monica pier and it lived up to all expectations. took some really great photo's and the beach was epic tooif you haven't already visited then you must!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/led98
40,Landmark too see,Seen the pier featured in tv programmes. Thought it would be a nice landmark to see. Walked down the pier a few stalls & a couple of restaurants & quite a few homeless people. Fair ground. A lovely Sandy beach. Had had great sunsets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hitch1971
50,Cool,I read some reviews and I expected the worst but we actually had a really nice time there. There were a lot of people but nothing you can’t handle. The ferris wheel was kind of expensive but overall we enjoyed our time there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cinaalb
40,Breezy seafront,This pier is a must visit site. One can feel the fresh ocean breeze in their faces. Also there are plenty of stalls and restaurants offering diverse delicacies. One can spend a couple of hours there and get some souvenirs too,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caseyw487
40,Fun times at the Santa Monica Pier!,"My first visit to the Pier and I was overcome in how so very clean the whole pier area was! The surrounding beach area, restaurants, activities had something for kids, teenagers (well behaved😊) and adults. This is a must see if visiting and a repeater for anyone who lives close by. Great eats from tacos, ice cream deserts, sandwiches and more. A wide assortment of rides and even a roller coasters Wowwwwweeeee. Looking forward to coming back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlohabyLA
50,A fun place to visit,"It can be very crowded and the rides are mostly for little kids. However, there are lots of street performers and lots of fun places to eat or get ice cream.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gjhinks
40,Fun & crowded,It is a really fun place to go specially if you stop in the fair and play some games! Get ready for some big concentration of people but the popularity of the place talks by itself.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pvollert
50,Heart and soul of Santa Monica,"Great place for a stroll, lots to see along the way. We walked the pier in the morning when it was not busy, and then visited again at night when it was hosting a music festival with several live Australian bands. The event was well organised and it was a great night out. The pier is a must when you visit Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nolsie1

40,"A must see location in Santa Monica, for the experience","The Pier is not a lovely location but an interesting one to visit. depending on the time of the day it could be hot and unpleasant and it could be a nice walk on the platform while observing people and families enjoying the funfair. The beach looks beautiful from here and you can take picture and try to remember all the movies that were shot here. Again, this is a place to see once and remember, not a place for revisit....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eficoa
30,Cute and crowded,"I took a friend who had never been to CA on 9/21/18 around 1pm. It was crowded, as usual. We parked at the Promenade and walked. It was an overcast, smog-filled day so the views were obstructed. I have never been here when it isn’t crowded. It’s neat to walk the boardwalk to hear the creaking in the old wood beams and to people watch. I’ve never eaten at any of the restaurants or gotten on any of the rides. Please be prepared to walk and wear sunscreen. There are a lot of panhandlers and you will smell the stench of bodily fluids near the park area.In my opinion, this place is an overrated tourist attraction. The beach is pretty but the water is generally always cold.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmmJoans
30,Kitschy,"Came on a Friday when school was in session—not particularly a sunny day, not terribly crowded. Beach lot parking is pricey but convenient, we found on street metered parking that was close by for $6 for 3 hours (max). Meters take credit card. Walked down to beach and over to pier. Pier is super tourist trap area and crowded with people who can’t walk or function in crowded situations. Muscle beach is on south side of pier. Lots and lots of equipment of different sizes to use. Not fancy stuff but fun. Renting bikes or scooters seems easy enough (we didn’t do it) and you can ride for miles along the ocean. After we were done we walked up to the city and walked around the streets to look at the shopping area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ALLSLC
40,Wildwood NJ Boardwalk on the West Coast,"It was a fun short visit. We walked the whole pier and took pics at the Rt 66 sign, the Pier entrance sign, and many other photo ops along the piers with the rides in the background etc. Good vibe, some local solo artists singing or playing intruments. Peeked inside the stores, overly priced t-shirts and souvenirs. Reminds me of a minature Wildwood NJ Boardwalk but in the West Coast and has a few homeless. Definitely a one time thing you should do if you have teens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lillyann-Biscuit
30,Fun and Crowded,This beach/boardwalk is very fun and crowded on a Saturday in September. It’s neat to go at least once. Sodas are 4.00 average. My son and I shared a 9 inch pizza for 9.00. It got us full & tasted pretty good. Not too bad a price for this kind of place. People watching is fun. Watching musicians and such was a treat. The beach was too crowded for me. Felt more dirty than other beaches. I would recommend going on a weekday. Parking... good luck.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahzac
40,Crowded happening place,Visited for a short while. Crowded but very lively pier. Lovely weather while i was there. Ice cream is yummy too. Just had a stroll down but didnt experience the beach. Wished i had more time there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mav-kayz
50,Best Pier in Los Angeles,"There is amusement park named Pacific Park having Ferris wheel, roller coaster and other rides. There is Playland Arcade for kids. Several restaurants and bars are there. Several artiest show their talent on the pier. In the last is a shop dedicated to end of the iconic Route 66. Has good parking space. One can spend hours here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VIPIN_GOEL_TP_Impex
50,Essential landmark to visit,"This is a fun pier, it's where Forrest Gump set out to just run and run - hence Bubba Gumps Shrimp store; it has a view over the beach where Baywatch was filmed and houses the carousel where Paul Newman worked in the Sting. We saw a very cool street magician there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/69234hazel

40,Been there done that!,"Went here for a short visit. Very busy venue with great views. Restrooms were under serviced with the amount of people visiting, but overall a great experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/25cp
40,Good place to kill a few hours,"I actually enjoyed the local shops and restaurants off the pier much more, but the pier is worth a visit. There's a great Mexican restaurant in the back that makes the most refreshing cucumber mojitos. We also enjoyed the musicians and just the walk along the pier. I prefer this over Venice any day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SNJ1
40,Cool breezes,It's amazing how much cooler it gets as you walk out on the pier over the water. Typical tourist place but some unique entertainment by various musicians along the way. Definitely entertaining. Prices all around not too crazy. A good stop to make.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MartinH145
40,Fun place to explore,"This was our first visit to Santa Monica and the Pier. There was a building with a carousel, an area with amusement rides, musicians, restaurants and a beautiful view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennyW619
50,Worth the visit,Really nice area with fantastic views. You can walk to Venice beach in 15mins and the area is safe and clean,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H3748ATdanielj
10,Tacky,"Tacky, seedy. Lots of homeless people and it has an unsafe vibe, especially after dark. Best place to eat is Bubba Gumps but even that not the best.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mand83
40,Entertaining,Well worth a visit when staying at Santa Monica.Safe and entertainment options. The best being the buskers and the ferris wheel.Food overpriced compared to other places in Santa Monica and I would suggest eating elsewhere first or bringing lunch with you.Great for people watchers.I recommend hiring a bicycle and riding to the more vibrant Venice Beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kenneth212
40,Mini Carnival on a pier,"So I found it a bit tacky. It's basically a carnival on a pier. Lots of carnival games (win a prize, etc.) and a Ferris wheel and small roller coaster and some other rides. Some good for kids. Overpriced food and touristy. Lots of street performer and kiosks of trinkets, etc. Great view.Would I recommend it? Eh, yeah, I guess. Worth seeing I'd say.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardpH3114VS
50,Beautiful View,The Santa Monica Pier was beautiful. The pier shops are perfect if you need to grab quick gifts for folks back home and the quick to go food was great. The street talent was great with all sorts of music and dance performances. Fishing seemed to be good too as there were many fishermen that appeared to be having a good time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharberryr
50,Absolutely lovely,"Really nice little pier at the end of Route 66. There is lots to do on the pier and in the local area. The pier itself has souvenir shops, arcade games and a few rides, the main feature is its Ferris wheel. Will be remembered forever as it’s where my partner recently proposed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sarahd8119
50,A personal favorite,"Something about this place I just love. Let me clarify that there’s a limited number of things you can do, but still, I always recommend at least spending a sunset or an evening there. The sunsets are BEAUTIFUL. There’s a few rides (small roller coaster, a ferris wheel, a carrousel), restaurants and places to get ice cream, coffee, etc. Sometimes there’s music, you can walk around, sit on the benches and just enjoy the relaxing view of the ocean, I’ve seen people fishing at night. I’d say it’s a must and an iconic place when in Santa Monica!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mtymx86
30,It’s ok,"I think it’s pretty, but I’m from the east coast of Australia, so I’ve seen very good beaches, and the beaches back home have clean toilets, no homeless people and nobody giving you a shifty look or trying to take advantage of you. Wouldn’t tell my friends to go there, I’d encourage them to spend their time another way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colinmN4230ZE
30,"Lots of people, there for souvenirs","I didn't expect much from Santa Monica Pier, other than a place for my friends and I to relax before heading to the airport. There were a lot of people on the boardwalk, lots of little shops with tacky and pricey souvenirs. An amusement park to one side, and fog all around us.A place to cross off the ""Things to Do in LA list"". Nothing spectacular in my opinion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/55felicer
20,Old fashioned and stale,Basically a typical old seaside town pier complete with people trying to sell you souvenirs or charge to have a photo taken with them. Nothing exciting or different about this place. The fact it is the historical end of Route 66 is about all that sells it. A few food places but you will find better places just off the main strip in Santa Monica.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngusMilly
40,Interesting and lovely beach,"Walked the whole pier and took ride on the big wheel which gave you some lovely views, Route 66 ends on the pier so pretty unique and good photo opportunity, would recommend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ManjitS454
50,Great atmosphere!,"We visited Santa Monica pier several times during our stay. It was very quiet early in the morning as nothing was open but it was nice to walk along the empty pier with a coffee and admire the views of Santa Monica and the open water. At the weekend, there are lots of musicians and artists who perform and showcase their work which adds to the pier's atmosphere. The Pier really comes alive at night when it lights up! Lots of places to eat and worth visiting Pacific Park even just to people watch! Worth visiting at different times of day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CHannah172
50,Classic experience!,Loved visiting the pier. There’s beach access & the pier itself has gorgeous views of the ocean/beach. The arcade and pacific park really topped off the whole experience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lbrooke12d
40,Sister's trip,Nice beach. Very crowded when I visited. The scenry was very nice. I plan on revisiting the Santa Monica pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharnise006
50,Surprisingly pelasant experience,Loved the roller coaster and the Ferris wheel. Live music and convivial crowd. There were a lot of people there but not oppressively so and it's a short walk from the beach and to some good restaurants and shops (the 3rd Street Promenade).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelfR9533RN
40,Kiwi in Los Angeles,"The Santa Monica pier is a cool place to visit. It’s been a long time attraction, you can feel the history there. It is pretty busy as it is seen as a must do. The rides where fun and the Ferris wheel was great. Is you play GTA V the you will really enjoy visiting here as they have made a real good effort to capture the pier.Have funkiwi in Los Angeles",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leonlance
30,Not Very Special,"Typical touristy pier, not very well maintained, on the dirty side. There aren't any upscale restaurants, lots of homeless detracts from visiting the pier. The day we left a person was murdered underneath the pier.Santa Monica needs to do something about the very visible homeless problem!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnP268
40,Nice place to hang around,"Its a nice place for family with kids to visit, you can swim in the beach then hang around the Pier, parking is about $14 as I remember.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cpos0000
50,Better than Disneyland!,My daughter and I stopped by Santa Monica Pier not really knowing what to expect but we had sooo much fun! We went to Disneyland California the next day and sad to say we had more fun at the park that was on the pier. My daughter didn’t even want to leave. We loved that the lines were super short. Some had no wait at all. They even let us re-ride a lot of the rides because no one else was in line so of course my daughter loved that. There aren’t a lot of rides but the ones they do have are very kid friendly and she loved them all. We did some of the games on the board walk and she won 2/4 we played so that was nice that she walked away with something. On our way out we saw an artist doing names in paint and only $5! It was beautiful and my daughter hung on to it for dear life the rest of the trip lol. As we were leaving she walked through the sand and found sea shells. An overall wonderful experience. I would only advise watch where you park. I called myself parking on the street and when I came back was slapped with a $65 parking ticket. Yikes lol. But we had so much fun it really didn’t bother me.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingLibra901
10,Seedy with great beach,The pier itself is full of old eating places and souvenirs. I was really disappointed. I don’t know how the rides were since I don’t like that kind of thing. The beach was gorgeous I think it’s the wider speech I’ve ever seen.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trng
50,Great way to spend the evening...,"Lively place. Parking in the nearby mall is free for the first 90 mins. The mall includes ""True Food Kitchen,"" something healthy to try.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vishnu_Pendyala
50,views,"The views of the ocean from the pier are fantastic. The wind cools you down from the hot heat from the sun, and the little park on property is nice! I love all the vendors on the pier. I think it is a nice shopping destination as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelergirl96
30,An Icon that is a little tired,"The pier is a must if you are down by the waterfront in Santa Monica. It is an icon and the end of the old Route 66. The roller coaster and Ferris wheel are, just ok..... more fun at night when the lights luminate the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alf165
20,"Used to be nice, now it's pretty much a dump.","10 years ago this place was great but now it's pretty scary. Becoming more and more ghetto and, 20 minutes after arriving, I got the heck out of there. Never again! We saw mostly low class, borderline ghetto people there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kennedyyy
40,Perfect spot to watch the sunset,They have banks to watch the sunset and also nice live music all the way around. Its a must see of santa monica or los angeles. There is homeless people but not as much as little venice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariamA1163CT
40,Love the view but too touristic..,"I put 4/5 because the view is beautiful, the beach is huge. It is a nice spot when you visit LA. Some people will say the water is dirty, some will say it is really packed and too many stores/restaurants for tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anthogx
40,$3 parking on the pier - great value!,"Google maps took my car directly on the pier. At first I was a little worried I made a mistake. It was awesome to drive over the wood planks and they only charged $3 to park directly on the pier which made for the world's shortest walk.Along each side of the pier is someone trying to make a buck either by performing, making, or selling something. At the far end of the pier, tucked in a little nook is a souvenir shop with prices lower than anywhere else on the pier for the same stuff. You can get 8 postcards for $1, stickers for $1, and Route 66 license plate and shot glasses for a few bucks less than the other shops. It's a hidden gem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RyanAndTiffany

50,Absolute Must See,"The pier and nearby Venice Beach are an iconic must see. The pier has boardwalk type games, an arcade, rides, restaurants , and various vendors. We rode the ferris wheel ($10/ea) for beautiful views. They have a souvenir shop on the pier. Parking can be a headache. We found out you can pay to park on the actual pier which I would definitely spring for so you don't have to walk as far as we did. Weather is always beautiful so the walk isn't bad. They're are bicycle and scooter rentals scattered throughout the surrounding areas. Parking is metered along the street or paid private lots.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amstrickland
40,Great date spot,This place was great to go to reminisce on arcade games and the typical fair atmosphere. The bars along the pier are reasonably priced and there's always live entertainment. The arcade games are old and need much more love but do not get in the way of our fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abarnes1
50,Great place,Always love paying a visit to the pier. Always very lively and entertaining. Lots of nice places to eat and drink.A lovely walk from Venice along the sea shore to the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenfanti
40,"Lots to see, not that much to do",A really fun and vibrant pier. Not many people actually on the rides. A few little stalls and some (mainly seafood) restaurants. It’s colourful and the people are nice. Some good music from buskers and a few talented caricaturists too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meganstericker
30,Good view looking back inland,"I guess in the UK we are a bit spoilt for piers. Visited this one as one of the things people do whilst in LA. It’s ok, not a lot on the pier and the price of coffees etc is way too much. Does provide a good view back to LA and the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GWSenior
20,I hate to say it,"I hate to say it, but the Santa Monica Pier is tacky and touristy. But tourists seem to love it, so it's unlikely to change.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/califcasl
40,Great beach,"Love Southern California beaches, first time on the pier. Was fun but very busy and so was the beach but still amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimmirae
40,Fun Place to Explore,Lots going on around the pier. Plenty of people selling stuff and some surprisingly good musicians presenting their talents.We walk all the way to the end of the pier looking out across the pacific. We also found a great old carousel to have a ride on.Great place to explore and spend a few hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aussie_Tourist79
50,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!",We traveled on a high school graduation trip with 11 teenagers and 5 chaperones. Our visit to Santa Monica Pier was great. There was so much to see on the pier and to swim in the ocean was a fun experience for sure!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trinaflittle
30,Playground,Do people go to the ocean to ride Ferris wheels?. Shop for trinkets - or to enjoy the sand and water? Just a question!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Altius10
40,Interesting place,"a easy walk from where we staying, interesting place to visit so many homeless people sleeping on the ground don’t understand why. So now we go to the rides they have a roller coaster and lots of others to entertain the children with. Plenty of food outlets so you can choose what you feel like eating. To me it’s not cheap. But hey you do have a variety of places to pick from.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/territ522
30,Fun,"Santa Monica pier is a fun to see place but everything is mostly overpriced. It’s a good hangout spot, both close to downtown and the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellyduong
40,Fun visit but not what we expected,"Santa Monica Pier is a must see when you’re in LA. But it was nothing like we had imagined. The beach is beautiful, the sunset was incredible and the bars just off the pier were great! But the pier itself is a little tacky and a complete tourist trap.We decided to use our trip there by hiring bikes and cycling to Venice Beach and back, we’d highly recommend this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abbyw371
50,Beautiful,I visited briefly on a Saturday as part of a day tour. It was such a great place to visit. I had my heart set on riding the Ferris Wheel but it was closed between (I think) 12:30-2:00pm. Why would you close it on a Saturday afternoon? And the girl who told me it was closed clearly needed a break; she was quite abrupt.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soaringjones
20,"Lovely view, beach, atmosphere, but......","Was nice while the sun was out, but we found it quite an uneasy place to walk from the pier to the train station at dusk. Lots of homeless, drugged/spaced out weirdos - one of which decided to call me (a mum holding onto my 11yo child’s hand whilst my other 2 children walked with their father a few feet away) the B word and only because I made eye contact. He pulled a fist at me and attempted to kick my husband who called out to protect his family. Will never return. My kids were petrified & this left a very bitter taste in our mouths. We had had. Such a great day until this point. I’d be very wary going there by transport. Never feel this unsafe back at home, ever.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Irenemathi
30,Fun Afternoon Spot,"The pier isn't very large but coupled with beautiful beaches, a fun vibe and a lovely crowd, and one can spend a good hour or two just soaking up the vibe of Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xpstyle
50,Fun place,"We visited Santa Monica Pier on Sept. 15th, 2018. We ate at Bubba Gumps and stayed and rode some of the rides. The pier was busy, but we found a parking spot quickly and easily.

50,Directly from a movie,"I felt like I was in a movie. It might not be the best park, but it is the park we have seen in so many movies and it is also the end of route 66, with a great view. Definitely a place that we have to visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/silvia_martins
30,Day trip,"Interesting place to visit to see the ocean and the beach. The place has a carnival vibe to it. If you are not eating there or attending the small amusement park you’ll be done in thirty minutes.Overall, it’s a bit of a tourist trap. Overpriced restaurants, trinkets for sale, mediocre street performers selling CD’s.We had a much better time up on the streets above the pier, browsing the shops and having a few snacks",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flatlandermanitoba
50,Lovely beach,It took us 30-40 minutes by train to Santa Monica from downtown LA. The beachside had lovely vibes filled with lots of people and palm trees. We loved walking and looking at beautiful sunset.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/qcube
50,Cool to See,"Was fun to see the Pier and ride the Ferris wheel. However, that was really all we did. There are more rides but we were not interested. Beautiful views!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shalanes2013
40,Typical Seaside Pier,"Walked the lenghth of the pier which had rides, local painters and stalls selling holiday tat. From the Pier it was easy to get a great view of the beach and the famous life saving huts so familiar from the TV series Baywatch. A beautiful beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SocialBridget

40,Great spot in LA,"Best deal to get is a wristband and the the kids have fun. We went mid evening before the sunset, was able to get on everything at least twice. Great ambiance. Could use some updating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarvianaJ
50,Nice!,"The end of Route 66!!!! Nice, fun pier to go to and have fun. Lots of choices for food and drink. Great for people watching. Many are entertaining with music, songs and arts. Get bikes and ride all along the coast. Even to Venice Beach!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RLHINCA
40,Fun for families during the day,"By nightfall the crowd gets rougher, I definitely recommend going during the day. The rides are fun, the food is typical carnival fare, midway games are fun but pricey, You can get discounts on wristbands if you buy online.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/momlikesthebest
50,Must see place,This place is bouncing. Take a walk down the pier and get a photo under the Route 66 sign. Grab some tacos at Blue Taco then hire a bike to Venice beach. Train comes right into Santa Monica (need to switch lines at 7th street stop from Hollywood) so you don’t need a car if your staying in LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeeDeeJC

50,Sooooo Fun!!,"This was a great adventure for our 4 & 8 year old. The rides, which open at 11am, weren’t crowded at that time. They loved all the rides, the game, the magician on the pier and fun Coney Island vibe. Beautiful beach here and unbelievably clear the day we were there. Parking is conveniently located next door for $14. Plenty of food/drinks and clean bathrooms.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SPSledd
50,"Nostalgic fun, a must-see landmark","Everyone has seen the pier on TV or in the movies - and for that reason it's worth wandering down to the end. It's old-timey and fun, and offers great views when it's clear, and even when it's foggy. Go and snap a few pictures : )",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/startupperc
40,Family trip,"Culture, culture, culture. This was a massive culture shock for my wife. She actually felt a little uncomfortable here, which I can understand. However I loved it. Yes there were buskers and people selling everything and trying to screw you out of money, but it was a great experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasonrB1253YW
40,Visiting for soccer colleges,"Took a day to walk the pier. Clean and restrooms. Lots of amusement rides, restaurants, vendors, even a sunscreen booth to apply for free! Took about 3 hours, parking is 10-15 bucks for the day. Also rentals for bikes scooters and boogie boards.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/505Green67

30,It's nice to see once,"Santa Monica pier is definitely a cool place to check out. Nice pier, ferris wheel, food, attractions, right on the ocean.. it's a cool spot. However I wouldn't say it's worth more than 1 visit longer than an hour. Parking is $25, but pro tip is to ask someone who is leaving for their parking pass.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jeffreeshen
30,End of Pac Highway Trip,I ended my pacific coast highway trip at the Santa Monica Pier. It was a decent place but there are homeless everywhere. Sleeping on the beach laying on the pier and definitely using the bathroom. I had to use the facilities and they were terrible. The Pier is historic and I walked around the point where a bunch of movies were filmed. If you’re in LA you should check it out. Lots of merchants and cool things to look at. It’s a year round state fair.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PHB11716
50,Fun place to enjoy an evening stroll!,"After spending five days in a hotel conference room, we couldn't wait to take in some sights, which lead us from LA down to the Pier. The weather was perfect, people were wading and wave jumping in the dark of night, and the street performers were incredible (one contortionist was crazy good, couldn't believe my eyes). So much fun, I really enjoyed it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mswaters1980

40,Must-do S. Cali Tourist Trap,"SMP definitely has the carny-atmosphere thing going but in a nostalgic kinda way with the Route 66 theme. The free sunscreen dispensers were a nice touch. We got a free appetizer coupon from the tourist info stand up on Ocean Front Walk, so ate lunch at Bubba Gumps. Seemed appropriate since in the movie Forrest's cross-country run ends at the rightmost lightpost on the Santa Monica Pier. We were seated on the ground-level floor by a window with views of all those taking pixs or selfies of themselves under the 'World Famous SMP  Welcome Pier' pedestrian walkway sign. Was as-good-as-it-gets if you're into people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OTR_Again_IM
50,Loved it!,"We decided against going to Venice beach after reading reviews on here and hearing that it’s just full of canvassers and homeless people. We may have been wrong to do that but after being to San Francisco a few days earlier we couldn’t deal with more poverty and homeless people.As an alternative we decided to come to Santa Monica and the pier area.The pier itself was full of life, we saw the sunset from the pier. There is a kids theme park on the pier and some arcades, restaurants and gift shops. At the end of the pier is some steps you can sit on and look out to sea whilst a busker plays songs on his guitar. The atmosphere was very good. Prices were pretty good, you could get a caricature for $3!The beach walk next to the pier is nice too with gymnastic equipment which people use to exercise and others to have fun. The beach is perfect sand. Very clean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dtr1989
30,Evening Stroll on the Pier,"Lots of fun stuff for the kiddos to do. A little amusement park, fishing, the beach. street entertainment. It was exactly as excepted crowded & loud though. Some out of control young adults. The Ferris wheel and the lights made for some nice video and photos though",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Misssuzan
40,Dream of mine,Always wanted to visit what a setting ! Loved it plenty to do just strolled around soaking up the atmosphere and the sun . Got a great video on the iconic coaster made my day .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackodanapoint
50,Worth a visit!,"Santa Monica has grown so big! Taking a stroll there got us out of the city atmosphere and brought us back to our youth and playful time. A picture is worth a thousand words, so enjoy mine!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmanuelled826
20,Looks better from a distance,"The allure and lights at night are enticing, but once there the pier is unimpressive and dirty. Walking to the pier just after sunset we saw rodents along the path and in trash bins about a half dozen times as there population seems out of control. We would try a day time visit next time and would enjoy the lights next time from afar.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonydT9649EZ
30,Bring the kids...,"This is a touristy environment with food and carnival rides to satisfy families. The food options trend toward the unhealthy (sorry); but, it's a nice walk that elicits nostalgia.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LovetheBigIsland
40,"Crowded and fun, but be careful","A crowded, fun, place, lots of outlets for food and souvenirs and much better on the days it is closed to cars. Watch your wallets / bags as opportunistic thieves frequentlyeye you off in the crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tonymf
40,Fun spot,Fun to walk and listen to the street musicians. I like to walk the beach below the pier. Many restaurants in Santa Monica you can dine at. I like walking the street outdoor mall. Easy to get to using public transportation if you are not driving.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garyc320
10,What a let down,"What a disappointment this was. Parking charge was very high and from the start street hawkers and beggars seemed to be in our face and wouldn't take a pleasant no thank you..had to up the No thank you to a point it became rather forcefull. I guess as route 66 starts here it's iconic but that's about it really, litter on the pier aLong with other indescribable made you look where you walked,not what we expected. The beach seemed a lot cleaner and the goods sold in the shops catered for "" tourists"" of course. We left somewhat disillusioned and let down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewp516
20,Neglected nice place,very busy place and very unclean if you are a tourist dont think about it it is horrible.I think the county can get some sponsors and renovate the whole place it has the potential to be one of the best piers in the world,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tamerhenen
30,Super crowded,"Nice beach and boardwalk however it was ridiculously crowded. They have rides and an arcade, food and ice cream etc. nothing really special if you have been to a beach boardwalk before. Santa cruise is much nicer in my opinion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T955SRjenniferr
40,Fun Times,Was my first time in Santa monica pier and it was fun. Great places to eat and great scenery. A must vist if you come to LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ttill243
50,Stroll from Venice,"We visited on a Saturday. We had parked at Venice Beach & walked all the way to the pier. Families were out & about & the vibe was very laid back. Food, rides & views. Buskers give atmosphere.There’s plenty of paid parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LivLetLiv2012
40,Nice,Was hard to find parking so we parked at hotel that were charging $25USD to park.Nice stroll at night with the kids. It was very busy when we went so just make sure you hold onto them with the busy crowds.Entertainment was good to watch walking along the pier.Another tourist attraction we were happy we got to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sfaumui29
30,Pier area ok,"Pier area and beach are good, venture off and it's a bit dirty and run down. Pier stuff expensive but it's a nice beach side stroll from here to Venice and back, about an hour each way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tennants1209
50,Totally Worth Going,Had a great time on the rides and the pier. Our 4 year old loved it! We had dinner one night and lunch one afternoon both were good at the restaurants we went to. When walking at night be aware of your surroundings. We didn't have any issues but better to be safe. Depending on where you are walking the pier has many dark corners/areas that are best to be avoided.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lorraine_0606
50,Just like I imagined,"Super busy, wall to wall people. The beach was absolutely packed, not sure if it’s just that being Australian we are used to more space but the beach was wayyyy to full for us. The pier is pretty dam cool tho, it’s huge and loud and colourful. Would be great to take your kids and go on the rides etc. we were lucky enough to score a park right on the pier which was awesome. It’s like a mini theme park just chilling out on a pier, you don’t see stuff like that in Oz, definitely worth checking out if you’re in the area. We didn’t go on any rides so can’t comment on them, we just walked around and took in the sights. Fun stop in on the way down the coast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeeandWillaJean
50,Gotta check it out when in LA!,"I live in LA and still like to visit the Pier whenever anyone visits and wants to be shown around. Always a good time. It’s lively, lots to do with decent eats right on pier and amazing food within walking distance all over Santa Monica. Rides are fun too, but pretty small. Definitely spend a day in Santa Monica and see the Pier as part of your day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patrickkaroly

50,A wonderful way to spend the evening after a great dinner,My daughter and I walked down to the Santa Monica Pier after dipping our feet in the Pacific Ocean.We strolled and stopped to listen to some entertainment (undiscovered talent) and check out the shops and kiosk.

40,"Nice, full of life!","Nice place, definitely worth a visit!Fantastic mixture of hurdles of people from all over. Nobody bothering you with trying to push-sell things, entertaining, great happy atmosphere.Definitely go visit Bubba Gump Shrimp right at the Pier!!!! Loved the Tom Hanks film Forrest Gump, but this place is a really exciting and fantastic extension to the film, if you‘d ask me! Splendid food too.Nice beach too there btw!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TRT78
50,A lot of fun,Nice little walk especially at sunset. Nice food and chance to win a teddy bear at the arcades. Can get quite busy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marts0424
50,Perfect pier.,"This pier has everything you would want and more from a pier. The food restaurants on offer were extremely nice, the arcades and games were brilliant fun and lots of variety, there was an area particularly for fishers and great shots to watch the sunset or grab a picture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kieranm384
20,Run Down and Dirty,"Went on a Saturday night, was very crowded and was not that fun - rides and food were expensive, and there were homeless people all over. I remember really liking the pier when I was younger, but it just felt run down and dirty now.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yoshapman
50,Must see,"Have been here several times over the years, one cannot visit Santa Monica without going on the Pier, the end of Route 66. Best at sundown for the stunning views of the golden sun dropping below the hills. A bit tacky but then all piers are.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripeagle
40,So much to do.,Most days it's busy. But now that summer is official over this is the best time to just enjoy the area. Take time to walk the boardwalk to Venice Beach it's a nice easy stroll and not to far from Venice Pier. I recommend mornings or early afternoon. Safety might be an issue in the evenings.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dar37
40,A must see but once is enough!,"Definitely a stop you’ll want to make, but I wouldn’t designate more than an hour or so to see it unless you have small children that would be using the rides.It had beautiful views of the coast!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W5852EJjesss
50,Certainly a MUST on a busy day!,"On a holiday or weekend, this will be bustling, in good weather.Many hollywood movie scenes were shot here too.Plenty to see & do for the whole family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R4288XBdavep
50,Take Time for the Street Performers!,"By all means ride the roller coaster and (our favorite) the ferris wheel, sample some food... but make sure you also stop to enjoy some of the street performers. If you're lucky you'll be there when magician Frank DeVille is performing some of the best tricks you'll ever see. He got a $20 bill from an audience member who wrote his name on it before Frank ate it (looked real...) and eventually got to the point when he cut open a clementine that had a different guy's initials on it and - not kidding - the $20 was folded and inside the orange.... We were astounded. I'd go back again just to see that trick again. But who knows what else you'd find on the pier? You need to go and check it out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wiertrvl
30,"Bit tacky, many homeless and smells of pot, but we still enjoyed it!","Second time visiting here. Remembered it as tacky a few years back and it hasn’t changed, except there are now many more homeless people with the pervading smell of pot in the air now it is ‘legal’. Someone was selling it on the entrance to the pier! Lots of people begging, selling stuff. Entrance area in the Palisades Park is very sketchy!That said, you can still enjoy yourself here! Enjoy the tack for what it is. It’s an old fashioned pier with fun rides but a touch on the expensive side.. we did go on the roller coaster which was fun and 10 USD a ride. First night the fair was closed off to a private event so be aware that can happen. We had a good lunch and few drinks at Seaside on the Pier. Recommend the roof terrace there for good views of the beach and ocean. Don’t recommend the amusement arcade really, very old and grimy machines with flies! Public restrooms at the end of the pier were actually fine and clean!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EssJayWhy
30,Fun tourist trap,I visited here with 3 adults and 3 children. Parking was pretty easy if you are willing to pay $20. The boardwalk itself was entertaining. There were carnival style games for the kids to play that were rather expensive but I guess average for what they are. Not too many food options at the boardwalk. We were able to find the mall nearby and ate at the Cheesecake Factory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Journey649846
30,Rating says it all: a shame.,"Having seen so much of the LA coastline on tv and in films we put Santa Monica down in the “to do “ visit list.The pier was underwhelming: nowhere near as big as it appears on tv. An overpriced amusement park, numerous tat shops and some restaurants. Because of its “popularity “ it’s also very very busy: if you can don’t park in the car park if you intend to leave after sunset as it takes AGES to exit: complete chaos and 30 minutes I’ll never get back.Not a patch on piers in the UK. Felt a bit like never meet your heroes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/speedbird350
40,A fun experience at night,"This was definitely a fun place to visit during our trip. We chose to visit at night when it was less hot, which was a good idea. Very very busy though!Fun for children! There is an arcade and a few rides also. Restaurants on the pier are very busy so book in advance if you want to eat there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bellarussell
40,okay,Kids loved it...need I say more?Old fashioned amusement park....loved the pretzel and my granddaughter loved the trapeze school,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drzlevy
30,Expected More,"My family and I had the Santa Monica Pier on our CA trip to do list. I have to say I expected more and was a bit disappointed. Many homeless in the area as well as religious preachers. The boardwalk had shops, restaurants and rides, but it was kind of run down and dirty. Its not like you see on TV at all. Very crowded on the boardwalk which I expected. We did a quick walk through and took pictures of the surfers, but left to go to the Promenade area which was very nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingThomas4
40,Great to Visit After Day at the Beach,"After a day at the beach in Malibu, we stopped by the pier. We had a great time walking around and people watching. We played some games (I won a stuffed Thor!) and took in the beautiful view. While we didn't ride any rides, they looked fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bdfenwick
40,Lovely walk,The nice place to walk together. Lots of couple come here to enjoy the sea. But beach is not nice as asia beaches.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NorthStar635257
30,Not Bad,The experience wasn't too bad for a holiday trip. The entertainment was pretty neat. The homeless on the beach for the most part were ok minus a few. Trashed out public bathrooms were absolutely disgusting with used diapers and defication all over them was yuck.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolKozak08
30,Meh,This is a very busy place and very touristy which is not my kind of thing. Walking on the pier once is more than enough for me. Too many other things to do and see in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Diane115
30,Great beach but be prepared!,"Had a great time at the beach! Not too crowded if you are away from the pier. We got there around 12 and got a spot very close to the shore. Beach was clean and the water was perfect. Although we brought chairs we could have been more prepared by bringing picnic food, drinks, an umbrella and toys for the kids. We could have loaded a mini wagon with all that stuff and taken the boardwalk to the shore...walking on the sand was a killer for our legs!The only thing that was a nuisance was the aspiring models in skimpy suits having pictures taken. Not cool when kids are present!Since we were hungry we decided to eat at Albright by the pier. Food was great, except for the rice-too soggy. Food was pricey by I guess everything is overpriced in California.None the less, we built great memories with the grandkids!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/330mariag
30,too noisy/busy,not my kind of thing. too many people and too noisy. it's good I went once but would not go again. too many other places and things to do/see,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/louisl172
40,Fun place !,A good spot to feel the LA pier athmosphere. Attractions are fun. Forget about the food. Great place for pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/509pascalm
40,Always Fun,"Been here plenty of times but my girl was visiting me from Dallas so decided to take her here. It was awesome! For tourists I would say be a little cautious walking around, there are quite a bit of homeless people in the area. In fact one of which stared at my girl and actually followed her for a bit until I approached him and asked what his deal was. Most of the street vendors are illegal immigrants and the day we were there was a bit sad because the cops decided to drop by and out of fear some of the street vendors took off running prompting the officers to give chase. Aside from those two things it was a lot of fun and will definitely take her back, there's almost always a seal around when I visit I am not sure if it's the same individual each time but it's always a delight seeing it out there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evberduo
40,Iconic,The pier is the symbolic end of Route 66 which had been our road trip for the past 17 days. Plenty of usual pier activities but a must visit location because of its Icon status. There are better restaurants in town but it is a pleasant walk and lots of people watching to be done at the very least.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeA398
30,Lacklustre,We’ve always liked Santa Monica but it appears to be troubled now. Quite a substantial amount of homelessness (more evident than our 2014 trip). The rides are overpriced - $10 for a ride on the roller coaster. The only redeeming feature it had was Bubba Gump.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travel_me_happy99
20,Tacky and not worth the long drive,We visited Santa Monica pier during a recent stay in LA. I expected so much more. The traffic was a nightmare and took nearly 2 hours when it should have taken 30 mins. We had to pay $14 to park. The pier had several shops and restaurants which were very tacky. There were tramps everywhere too. The beach was lovely and the views were great but it wasn’t worth the long drive and expensive parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beccy113456
50,Lovely,I Love this place. The pier is beautiful and makes you feel good and relaxed. There is good Bubba Gump at pier,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deborab667
30,Very crowded,The beach is beautiful. White send very clean. But the traffic was terrible and the road light didn't let cars go through,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Passenger683493
30,Pleasantly kitschy.,We took our eleven-year-old daughter recently and she enjoyed a couple of the rides. The real attraction is the beach beside it. Riding the ferris wheel at night gave us a neat view and on a clear day would be great as well for some shots of the coast.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/13LJG
40,Iconic if busy attraction,"On a Sunday afternoon there were lots of people about but it was still easy to park a couple of blocks away. There are a number of rides to go on, food and live entertainment. We spent two to three hours on the pier and were never bored.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/149stuartc
40,Classic but be prepared for crowds,Santa Monica Pier is one of the most classic sights of the city. If you take the time to wait in line for the ferris wheel you'll be rewarded with one heck of a view. Be prepared. It's extremely popular so very crowded at all times.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimmy8424
40,Like a Traveling Carnival,"Much like a traveling carnival--food booths, trinket sales, street performers, arcade with video *and* pinball machines, and rides. Fun if you like that sort of thing. Scary if crowds bother you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/room412wasgood
40,A place you don't want to miss if you are in LA,"Great atmosphere, a lot of people, excellent view. You can expend a couple of hours there and then have lunch at one of the many good restaurants on the pier or within walking distance from it. Go in the summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arturosbaja
40,Loved it,"Apart from the hobos asking for money this was brilliant for our boys.We’ve been traveling about and to just let the boys have fun and eat candy floss and ice cream was a fantastic break.They loved all the rides and the best deal we found was to buy the all inclusive arm bands. Our 3 year old was allowed on every ride except the big roller coaster.Although it looked busy we didn’t wait to go on any ride and on the big Ferris wheel we got some fantastic pictures of Santa Monica.A simply must when visiting here with small children, just steer clear of the vagrant people as they’re drawn to tourists",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jumby15
20,Disappointing & dirty. Go take a couple of pics and run away.,"We went at night hoping to find some piece of R66 history and evening fun/dinner. What a disappointment. Place is dirty & tacky, not a decent restaurant or snack. Ended up having a couple of wings on the go, which were overly greasy and spicy and took forever to be served. A shame as this could be a mythical place again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erictabet
30,Crowds galore,"Santa Monica pier in person is quite different than seeing it in films. You are quite literally in the throngs of the masses, especially in the summertime. I also think the venue could be upgraded: it has mostly retro and somewhat tacky offerings.It is what it is. Don’t bring your passport or your cash. Or your kids if you ever want to see them again Ha ha ha! I slightly recommend it if you must, but there are so many other things to see in Los Angeles it seems a waste of time to me.Happy travels!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joshcalkid
50,Still great!,"After all these years this SoCal icon is still going strong. Improving in some ways, such as cleanliness. Restaurant at the end of the pier is great. Every time is a good time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeMc666
40,Santa Monica Pier: History and Nostalgia all wrapped up in one,"When the official ‘End of the infamous Route 66’ meets the likely origins of Popeye, you have to take time to absorb the history and nostalgia of the surroundings. This resurrected wooden landmark provides focus and interest to an already known and established Pacific Highway town.The pier is instantly recognisable from afar, with its Ferris Wheel and Rollercoaster framing many an iconic photograph for thousands of visitors.The pier is a hive of activity and caters for all ages across a broad spectrum of entertainment, eating houses and facilities. There are the regulars, local fishermen who throw numerous lines into the olive green swell 40’ below, the local hawkers offering to read your palm or paint your name in a myriad of styles suitable for framing. The more established fun fare rides and a veritable feast of restaurants (Bubba Gump is prominent amongst others).The ebb and flow of visitors almost matches the tides that rise and fall around the pier and you have to remain patient when travelling the walk way from Santa Monica, over the Pacific Highway to the pier -it’s not that wide and small children and families don’t walk that fast, especially when climbing away from the pier.Nationalities from all around the world festoon this iconic landmark at all times of the day, taking selfies with the Route 66 End market post giving the pier a multi-linguistic feel, but all carrying that sense of excitement and awe as they take in the infamous sites and sounds.The pier, whilst not on the scale of the pyramids of Egypt or the Temples of Mexico and Peru, is a venue not to be missed and I would encourage everyone to visit it once in their lifetime if they can.And as the sun sets over the ocean and the lights of the pier begin to twinkle in the fading light, take in the view and relish this most iconic venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N4764XGandyt
50,Very fun! Great for a family.,"The Santa Monica Pier is a must if you're in the area. A lot of fun rides, amusement park food and the ocean all wrapped up into one. The traffic can be challenging during peak times of the day, but I'd you plan right or stay in the area it's worth the bit of hassle. And I recommend visiting at night...a cool, fun atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z7562IOmaryb
50,A lot to look at,"This is a great place to people watch. Don't miss eating at Bubba Gump. This is the end of Route 66. Small carnival on pier, definitely a tourist trap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K4095MUsuec
30,Hard for GF Food,Lovelly area and the carousel never fails to delight. Some upgrade works in the area so care and patience was required.Watch out for all of the e-scooters as they don't choose to follow the rules of the pathways.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DIBBLE06
30,Beautiful Beach,Very crowded... lots of touristy shops... liked Sign Route 66 End...Clean restrooms... good snacks/treats... Great boardwalk... a great place to put on your to see list!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lroesener
50,West Coast!,"This is west coast and we loved it since it was our 1st time. The water was beautiful, the pier had everything and the weather was right. I have experienced many piers on the east coast such as Ocean City Maryland and Atlantic City, New Jersey but this was a knock out being it was beautiful and the famous Santa Monica Pier of the west coast. I would love to see it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Enfamale
30,Been there done that,"Guess you have to have a look and take a photo if there, Stayed in Santa Monica but took nearly a week before we went out on the pier. Rides are very underwhelming.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BlairC255
40,Arcade was awesome,Great vintage games!Rides seemed excessively expensive.Nice place to walk around for a bit.Seven more characters.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonathanpO8064QQ
50,It is iconic,It truly is on our list every time we travel to southern california. Our kids look forward to walking around the peir and playing in the water. It is fun for the whole family! Also there is a Really cheap souvenir shop under the peir!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rebekahontherun
20,Cheap and cheerful,"I wouldn't be rushing out of my way to visit this attraction. There was quite a nice atmosphere with buskers plying their trade as you walk towards the end of the pier where - well, there wasn't much really. On the way, you pass a few shops and a kind of a fair with a Ferris wheel and roller-coaster (very tame). But it doesn't grab you (some kind of claim to being the end/ beginning of route 66 aside) and say, ""come and visit me again"". So I won't!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Copey53
50,Something for everyone,"Great pier, lots to see and do and there really is something for everyone. Not overly expensive either. Enjoy, we did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daveb315
10,Crowded! Crowded! Crowed!,Don't go. Very crowded and dirty. Too many vagrants on and around pier area. Not worth wasting your time visiting. We wasted 30 minutes of our trip there. Should have gone elsewhere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VizslaLI
20,Overrated,"I came by here with my friends the first time I ever visited LA and my oh my was it disappointing. Honestly, we’ve all seen the LA scenes portrayed beautifully in movies, posters ever other Tv show... and I just have to say, it’s full of unwanted crowd, tourists, people trying to sell you stuff, and just an unattractive herd of crowd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sediss
40,Love the Grande Ferris Wheel,"Very busy and crowded walk down to the pier, the walk down is ok, but that walk back up, it's like walking to school uphill in the snow only its hot. LOL Pretty view of the ocean and all kinds of food, pricey though. Nice for a sight seeing experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/15receptionist
50,Summer Vibes,Great Pier!!! the biggest one I have ever seen. Very nice restaurants you can enjoy yr food. Full of entertaintment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meltemh2018

20,Crowded and filthy,There are so many people along Ocean Avenue leading into the pier. There are people with designer shopping bags and absolutely horrible smelling unfortunate homeless people going through the trash there are people on the scooters which are not supposed to be on the past and there is absolutely no presence of any Authority police or anyone other than one woman staff member on a little bicycle telling people not to go through the trash the place needs to be hoes down wash and monitored so that people with large dogs are kept on leashes and that people who are going to the trash or guided or a skirted to a better place more suited for them to be taken care of rather than to be 2 inches away from a couple sitting on a bench trying to enjoy the view while they're digging through the trash it's very unfortunate but something needs to be done about it mostly everyday this whole park leaving in to the pier needs to be completely washed down and hosed to cleanse everything of the urine and the trash that is all over the sidewalks and even on the grass. There is absolutely no excuse for a city like Santa Monica not to clean and maintain this area better and to have our presence of nice smiling official people monitoring these parks and the entrance to the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Irvinggetthecar
50,Omg!,What a beautiful place!This is a must see in LA!Like in a movie!You can see everything!I feel in love!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/6vanja_

50,First stop on our American adventure,"This was the first place we (we is my friend and I) drove to after we got off our 14hour flight. Even in our sleepy state it was beautiful. Being summer break the pier and the beach were packed with people but it is still a great place to visit. The pier itself isn’t too long so it’s an easy walk, it’s jam packed with places to eat and drink and not to mention the Ferris wheel and the roller coaster 👌🏼There was a yoga class being conducted at the end of the pier overlooking the water and running crews coming and going throughout the day too.There were many places to buy souvenirs and street artists spotted along drawing portraits of people so anyone wanting the touristy experience, Santa Monica pier is a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samanthar632
50,Awesome!,"Iconic spot that is a must do when visiting Santa Monica! Crowded and high energy with great people watching, rides, churros and other classic beachy boardwalk classics. Love this place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelchamp1
30,"If you have never been, GO","If you have never been to the Santa Monica Pier, then you should go if you are in the area. The surrounding garages offer free parking for a two hour time period. The garages are easy walking distance to the pier. I expected a more beautiful area, cars are allowed to park all along the beach, which takes away greatly from the view. The pier is large and a nice walk, with several souvenir shops and restaurants along the way. Street performers are very sketchy, and I could see it being a rough area and not family friendly at night. The view out into the Pacific is very hazy, even looking at the shoreline was a hazy. If you have never been, GO, but not sure it's worth seeing more than once. Remember it is the end of Route 66, as far as you can go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Love2TravelUS

40,Great experience just few minutes away of crowded LA.,"When in LA this is the place that make you feel you are on holiday. Nice beach, surrounded by nice palm trees, restaurants and holiday atmosphere. The pier in itself is taking you to enjoy a great vista and a great sea breeze if you don’t want to go on the beach. Shops and entertainment will make everyone happy. Note that you can access the pier by car!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NabilBKK
40,Busy Crowded Pier,"Lots to see. Your typical pier with games, stands and eateries. Nothing fantastic but worth a visit just to take photo under the sign ""End of the Trail Highway 66""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/100christina
40,Nice place to visit,The pier was pretty crowded but easy walk there was plenty of entertainment including musical acts lining the pier. Rides are a bit pricey.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/merrudy
20,Not as nice as Venice beach,We visited Venice and Santa Monica pier on the same day. The pier is too touristy for my taste. We’ve decided that if it has a bubba gumps it’s not worth going. If you are there go. At Venice beach we played in the water. We rented boogie boards for $10 for 2 hours and the water the board walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lornam177
50,Fun,"What a great time we had at this pier! The beach was beautiful! The water was warm and lovely. The pier had other things to do as well. It is the end of route 66 which I found interesting. The bathrooms were gross but other than that, I would suggest everyone go and see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brockoli86
50,Just like I Imagined!!,"Had read so much about Santa Monica Pier, and it didn't disappoint. We were disappointed that the Adult Merry go round was closed while we were there, but the Pier was alive with small shops and buskers and artists. We thought it was great. The hop on hop off bus drops you right at the Pier. A great day out!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Judijelly
50,Buskers and cools kids,"The roller coaster is worth a go. Airtable hockey a must. Do both at nighttime.The best bit is the buskers that sing. Go all the way to the end of the pier, their is a outdoor seating area. Sometimes singers come and perform. Usually around 5-7pm. Well worth the walk there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeDimelow
50,"Quintessential old time/new time too Pier w/rides, cotton candy & the works!","Went w/visiting family this Spring (we live here but usually don’t go cause saving for the tourists:) The Ferris wheel was great—scary, but very safe, albeit expensive! Like most everything in SaMo, but lots of fun & worth it—especially if u have kids or are adults who celebrate their inner kids:(",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexsmom2016
10,Scary people,"Santa Monica has always been images of fun and sun but that has changed. On walking to the pier there are any number of vagrants and mentally ill (or possibly on drugs) who hassle you for money or are mindlessly screaming. It is no longer enjoyable getting to the pier, these frightfully bold individuals have ruined the pier experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sixxmom
40,Nice afternoon,Parking is a big problem unless you take a private public parking which can cost 15$ and more. Lot of music and perfomances.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/65ohadb

40,A pier full of character and things to do...,Highlight for us was the Victorian carousel which has been used in many films. Enjoyed and would recommend the traditional ice cream parlour. Spent a good couple of hours meandering along the pier watching fishermen and enjoying the vibe as well as view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garycritten
40,Great place to visit,"We really enjoyed our visit to the pier as it has a real American traditional feel to it. We parked in the car park and set off across the sea front and then circled back through the downtown shopping area. Be warned, that was a very long walk. I would recommend setting up an account for the Bird/Lime electric scooter loan scheme, because you can pick them up anywhere. I wouldn’t cancel a trip to one of the local theme parks to focus on the pier’s attractions though - it is too small/tame for teenagers, and the rides are more appropriate for younger families. Overall, we had a lovely visit though and would recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N1579POneilc

30,Family visit of Santa Monica Pier,"We visited Pacific Park which is an oceanfront amusement park located on the Santa Monica Pier, and the major cool thing about it is that it looks directly out on the Pacific Ocean. Apparently, it is the only amusement park on the West Coast of the United States located on a pier. There were a total of twelve rides in Pacific Park, including a roller coaster that is short and finishes in a minute or so but circles the majority of the park which tells you how small is the park. The roller coaster that you're allowed to do twice in a row is the main attraction with the wheel that we skipped. We bought bracelets that allowed us to access those attractions.A small ocean facing park that the kids enjoyed but you do only once for an hour or so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/500alexandrek

30,Touristy and noisy but worth a (very quick) visit.,"Visited a few times.Very noisy, food/drink very expensive but lots of it looked tasty.All very touristy with the rides, music, touts etc. But I guess you have to visit if you're a tourist heading to Santa Monica beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jomP5697RD
20,Nothing like the pictures.,"I found Santa Monica pier dirty, dated and overpriced. It was nothing like I expected it to be and I left feeling let down.

20,"Dirty, noisy, chaotic","On our trip down Hwy 1 we decided to check out the famed Santa Monica Pier. What a disappointment. We paid an astronomical $40 to park and made our way to the pier with thousands of other people. There were people hawking fruit for sale, Trump haters barking at people on megaphones, people shouting about salvation and the end of the world, and cheesy rides and tourist trap shops. The beach was overrun with people and you could barely stir them with a stick there were so many. Really commercial, noisy, trashy and dirty. Don’t waste your time or money on the stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenned17
30,Ok but thats all,Yes its a pier but a very busy pier with not a great deal else. Its free to walk along but very busy and noisy.Better off walking down the main st area with its nice shops and coffee bars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sidecarmark
50,Loved it,"This was the end point of our route 66 trip, so it was a much do trip. So glad we did. The weather was perfect and we thoroughly enjoyed walking the full length of the pier. We had some lovely food in Albrights before we left... Do it guys its a great day out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kassyoppa
50,First Time. Fun Time,A lot going on here. Super busy with people and parking took a little bit but we found a lot right at the entrance of the pier below a restaurant.Lots of good people watching and seeing the coastline The local music acts along the pier were amusing and talented and the. Mexican restaurant at the end of the pier was a perfect place to unwind with a margarita and some chips.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B5764INshawns
30,A Nice Diversion,"We parked on the beach lot, which cost about $14. There is a mall just up the street with better rates but it is quite a hike to the pier. The pier itself is crowded with a lot of vendors, restaurants and carnival rides. Ate lunch at Bubba Gump Shrimp Co overlooking the ocean. I found Huntington Beach to be better with its more friendly bike lanes and expansive walkways to stroll down the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josh_p01
30,Too Busy!,It is a nice pier but being there during the summer holiday it meant it was just too busy. Also the 100's of traders didn't really help! Might try it again when it is not high season.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paul-andrin
50,Nice&crowded,"Very nice pier full of good restaurants, bars. Very huge, sandy beach. It was very crowded, hard to find a park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/803melisaf
30,Very Crowded !!,"We found the pier very crowded, which is understandable in the Summer, but also a Police incident kind of spoilt our experience!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WilfandFamily
30,Just like the movies,Walking through the pier seems like you are in the movies. The amusement park leave much to be excited about but just the ambience at night is amazing. In the day walk along the beach to venice beach. does make one relax.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andrew998
30,Pleasant pier,"Enjoyed short walk along pier but very crowded. It is full of the usual souvenir shops, cafes etc. Didn't go to the amusement park as we had just done Disney. Pleasant views from here. Preferred cycling along the beach path.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathstevens2017
50,A must do,"You can’t come to Santa Monica and not go to the Pier! A true icon. Try the Pier Burgers! And Big Deans Ocean Cafe too! Grab an ice cream. Ride the Ferris, especially at night when the whole Pier lights up! Just stroll the Pier and enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveB689
40,Santa Monica Beach Fun,"This pier Is fun for youngsters. The Ferris wheel is beautiful especially at night. There are rides and food, and it isparticularly pleasing at night. There is paid parking nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichelleElyseLesser
50,Great weather. Great day at pier!!!,Very impressed with parking fees (right on beach) and the cost of meals. We ate at a restaurant that hat umbrella tables on the right when you first enter onto pier. Very pleasant staff. Good food. Great view!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dorisf98
30,Too Crowded,"I guess when in Cali one of the “musts” is to stop by Santa Monica Pier, so we did just that. We walked most of the pier but it was way too crowded. Restrooms are crowded and dirty. Restaurants on the pier are so so. Lots of vendors, carnival rides, and people trying to make a quick buck (a young man was selling back flips for $2). We have young kids (2 and 5 years old) so for us the Pier was not worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/madrehoodandoils
50,Nice day,Very scenic and nice the pier is so iconic being the end of Route 66 very cool to see and experience the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mcsbravo852
30,Too crowded,"Visited during the start of the school year in hopes of less crowds, but it was still too crowed to be enjoyable. Lots to see and do if you are willing to stand and wait.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tako9
40,Good old fashioned fun,"There is a large car park next to the pier so getting here is easy. Then you can enjoy the pier. It will be crowded but with a police station on the pier (where the jail used to be) it felt safe wandering around. There are snack bars, restaurants and rides - or you can fish off the end of the pier. There are the expected free toilets but also a sunscreen dispensing station! The pier also has a souvenir shop to mark the end of Route 66 which starts in Chicago. The beach and sea complete a fun day out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAF_Wales
50,Fabulous day,We parked near by and the beach was clean and beautiful. The pier is full of old fashioned but fun games lots of places to eat. We really enjoyed our day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/523gaynors
40,Good time on tge pier,I stop at the pier every time I'm in Santa Monica. Lots of people and entertainers on the pier. Gteat for people watching.Easy access to the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cvkuehn
50,A must visit for me.,My favorite place when I visit LA.Love the carnival atmosphere! It can also be peaceful and relaxing at the same time when you just sit at the end of the pier and fish or just take in the sunset.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ComdrJeff
40,Touristy but always fun!,"The pier is always beyond crowded, but it's worth the effort. Super view of the coast line, and if you can bear the lines, take one of the rides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suzmarch
50,Totally Worth The Time,"It's iconic if you are in the area make the trip happen it is worth the crowds and noise. Take your time, walk the pier and then walk the beach...it will be a lifetime memory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rwprevett
50,We loved Santa Monica Beach and Pier,"We visited Santa Monica beach and pier three times during our week in LA. Loved the beach, clean fun waves to swim and play in, great fun on the pier and a nice town too.We even saw filming of Grey’s Anatomy on our last morning at the beach too!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noela790
40,Fun but Expensive!,As with most tourist hot spots the prices for rides are outrageous...but if you can get past that it is fun!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Heather0313
20,"Cheap place, nothing great",Didn’t find the place special. Was crowded and the beach was not any good. Just spend few hours and left for Venice beach which is much better and happening.There are nice restaurants right across the streets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/771navink
30,"Kinda fun, bring your bathing suit.",Santa Monica Pier has some small rides and a couple of restaurants including a Bubba Gump Shrimp. Really known better for people watching and then utilizing the beach and ocean below. Official end point of Rt 66 and there is a marker indicating as much. Good picture opportunity.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/randyr498
30,Sunday night crush,Traffic was awful. Parking was really tough and took over and hour to navigate. See it during the week day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hess02025
30,Interesting to visit once but dirty and busy. Not our favorite beach.,"We had never been so decided that we wanted to visit. We went for dinner and to walk in the evening on the beach and pier. It was extremely busy and pretty dirty everywhere. Lots of food and entertainment options all around the area. Our kids didn't try the rides but we ate and looked in the shops. Our children are 12, 10 and 8. They thought it was interesting and liked people watching. We enjoyed the evening but wouldn't go again. Lots of public parking a few blocks away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kdzmom3
40,Fun seaside spot,"Went to the pier as we had go Los Angeles card and the fun fair is included (as is the aquarium but it on the day we went). The pier is lovely and there are a number of rides, stalls and food shops. There was a decent police presence so despite the crowds it felt safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E5199FSnickb
50,Electrifying,"I have been to LA countless times, but for some reason, never stopped by Santa Monica. While the area as a whole is great and worth a visit, The Santa Monica Pier is a definite must go. The place is electrifying. So much activities to do and things to look at, buzzling with people. It will now be one of the LA tour stop I'll have when friends and family come over the area for a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/294dannyv
50,Busy but funn,After a swim in the sea it’s worth a visit .There are rides and food . Watch out for the 7$ ice cream cone . They don’t do small here . It’s hot this time of year and rather crowded .There is a metro about 5-10 minute walk away .Maybe Venice Beach is better .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JGFIELD
30,Interesting but nothing special,"The Santa Monica Pier has rides, games and food that you would find at most boardwalks. So, if you like those things and are in the neighborhood it is worth a visit, but there is nothing unique or much above average to be found.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B5420FHdavidp
30,Expensive and run down! but good for sunset.,Its about time the Pier gets a renovation with new rides etc. The restaurants are expensive and even the photo both is $7 for 1 photo. Great location to watch the sunset.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prajyothm
30,Crazy crowded Saturday night,It took more then an hour to find a parking and it was very difficult to reach it.The pier is nice and interesting. On Saturday night probably too crowded.No way to find a place where to eat (we were ten people) every restaurant was full and none accept reservations.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hairfare
20,Don’t bother!,"Travelling from England with teenagers who were keen to visit the ‘fabulous’ Santa Monica. Don’t bother!The pier is full of strange people preaching anything from Jesus to Trump, the sea and beach are both filthy and slimy with litter everywhere and the smell of weed is EVERYWHERE (has made me realise why is should remain illegal). Complete waste of a day.Everything for sale was either over priced or sub standard - the churros were hard and dry and the rides were $10 each.Parking is a nightmare - they close the car parks with spaces still in.Only good thing was Bubba Gumps - as the food and atmosphere was excellent!Drive further to Santa Cruz - beautiful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebeccajmccabe
40,Fun Place to hang out,This is a fun place to hang out. Several restaurants are on the pier as well as souvenir shops. There are lots of locals playing music and people fishing. You can watch the surfers or go on some carnival rides. Relax and have fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/172mds
20,Over busy over priced,Personally I’d rather go to Brighton pier.The rides were pretty boring. You’ll pay $4 for a vending machine coke.Might just be the Brit in me but you shouldn’t walk along a pier without fish and chips in ur hand and that wasn’t on offer!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gemloucam
50,The Happy Place,"I watched this place a lot of times in a movie. Like my fave "" Raise your Voice and Kissing Booth"". I always want to see this place way back. The view is perfect. There is a Pub on the pier called Maria Sol. It is nice to just relax and get a drink there. There are people who plays instruments and playing classic songs.If you just want to be alone and enjoy the beach. The rides looks fun though I didn't tried it anymore. I love, love the place so much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CholetzTravelDiaries
20,Extremely Crowded Place - Maybe too much,"Even if the view is always nice, the place was extremely crowded.Cannot avoid to say that Area like whole LA is full of Home-Less which anyhow does not give a clean and nice image to the city also since sometime same are under effect of drugs and alchol and have extremely bad behaviour not nice at young kids eyes.Would recommend to be careful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/8Giac6
10,The absolute american kitsch!,"Filthy and kitschy! What a pity for this excellent location, just on a long broad and fine sanded beach, with unobstructed horizon towards the ocean!On the other, it is not surprising, as the US and especially LA/Hollywood are the inventors of kitsch par excellence! Everything is blink blink, but cheap and fake! The crowds though like it and keep cramming into it, in a vicious circle of lost quality and high visitor numbers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elenik392
50,Great experience,"Weather, sound of music and tasty food are few reasons to not miss the Pier! Easy to find it and to spend a wonderful afternoon there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrisChiriac
30,Too Crowded but Beautiful,The crowd is overwhelming and takes away the experience but it’s a beautiful place to visit and a beautiful beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I2199OOkimberlyp
50,Excellent View of the Sunset,This is a very lively place that offers a wonderful view of the ocean. Santa Monica Pier is also a great place to watch the sunset.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D_W_10017
30,Fun in the sun,"It’s the classic California experience to go to the beach, on the pier that has amusement rides and games on it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelinSuz
40,"ICONIC, EXPENSIVE, BUT STILL GOTTA GO","My 4th time there, have always gone on a weekend when crowds are at their peak. The pier is wall to wall people with long lines for the 2 restrooms(one in the middle, one at the ocean end) but makes for lots of interesting things to see. There was a fantastic live band, lots of cool kiosks, at one point a disturbance requiring no less than eight squad cars which came slamming in one after the other. (It is very safe, whatever happened they seem to have gotten it under control quickly.) There are lots of restaurants serving the typical burgers, tacos and pizza- prices are outrageous, though- $16 for 2 tiny tacos and two drinks. As always, I rented bicycles below and just to the right of the pier. There are several bike rental places for about a quarter of a mile towards Venice. $34 for two bikes for the two hour round trip ride up to Venice along the beach walk, past Muscle Beach and into Venice to ride over the canals. Plenty of less expensive places to eat in Venice via bicycle, and most rental places give you locks for free. There is a bike lane on the road in Venice and people seem to be used to tourists riding in the streets. Parking for the Pier is not usually a problem, even on crowded weekends there is usually room in the lot, $14 for the day and includes beach access next to the pier. (The beach was wall to wall people, also.)Ride tickets are $10 each ride or $20 for a ride pass. Lines for the rides move quickly, only a few minutes wait. Overall, will probably not be the best time of your life but still gotta go at least once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/631katrinag
40,"Beach, Sun and Fun💃🏻","Santa Monica Pier and beach was beautiful. Lots of activities going on like riding bikes, scooters, boogie boards, muscle beach sun bathing etc... the Pier lots of games, rides, souvenir shops, music and a seafood restaurant",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrendaB815
50,Good fun,A good short walk with shops and food or drinks. You can walk up until the Ocean and gaze at the waves or ride rollercoasters at the amusement park. Fun to visit with friends or family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crShelidon
30,Avoid the weekend if possible... a must do even if it’s crowded,"Santa Monica Pier has a charm to it because of movies, it being the end of Route 66, and well because it’s Santa Monica Pier. We recommend walking to the end first and then working back towards the beach. It’s crowded and everyone is selling their wares. Instead of getting caught up in the madness, go look at the ocean and listen to the waves and then find the cheep eat, souvenir, or whatever else you came for. You’ll be glad you did... you made it to the end of Route 66!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanFortune
30,Similar to the Jersey Shore,"This is a small version of a pier like you’d see in Wildwood NJ. There are rides, games, performers and eateries.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kris91
40,Great Place,We were in California and felt he had to go see the pier. We drove from Los Angeles with the kids. The views are wonderful. We had to put our feet in the ocean. OMG it is so cold and it was June! Crazy! We had lunch on the pier and took a lot of pictures. Then just walked around the beach. Fun place and we felt we had to see it. Oh and there is a great Mexican Restaurant on the end of the pier overlooking the water. Good food and service,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YoBob536
20,Went with Family (3kids and spouse),"We came on a weekend and it was very busy. With all the amazing beaches California has, there is no reason to come here for the beach since parking is a pain and the beach is very busy. The rides and attractions on the pier were very busy and not very good. The street performers were more like scam artists. The show we say, the ""performer"" refused to do the act since he felt he was insulted by the amount of money the crowd had given him. The shopping nearby is all the regular mall stores so why fight the crowds and traffic when you can just go to the mall. Overall, I don't recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EasyTravellerLam
30,Crazy Busy,We visited with kids on a Sunday not sure it was the right decision. We paid $25 for parking only to see cheaper parking at the pier. I don’t know where all the people come from it was just to crazy in the hot sun and chaos. I would recommend going late in the afternoon and maybe during the week. We didn’t get a chance to really experience the Pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/789bobbyt
50,What “A” DAY with my Wife!,After a short walk from the big parking lot at Santa Monica Pier we arrived at the perfect spot to fish. The temperature was so cool conmpared to the scorching Valley just 20 minutes away. This was our first time fishing here. For years we have walked past pier fishers and commented how fun it looked. Today was our day and what “A” day it was. We took chairs a small cooler and tossed our lines over while watching a perfect sunset on the Pacific. Babe would you like to come back; and we both smiled and said Yess!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mantis24
50,You must visit,Amazing atmosphere with all the street entertainersThe place was buzzing with all the LA locals and tourists catching the sunThe inside Vintage Carousel was fabulous and beautifully restored and maintainedAll the normal kiss me quick seaside stuff for those that like it!You even have parking down there for $14 all days which we thought was good if you a car full and make a day of it!A must visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gerard106
50,Awesome round trip at the coast,"We spend a fantastic day traveling around from Hollywood to Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, Venice Beach to Malibu!This day had everything. Shopping excitement in Santa Monica, great lunch at Bubba Gump at the Santa Monica Pier, a hot but nevertheless great walk to Venice Beach and a perfect finish at Malibu Beach with my beloved Gallery and Mr. Brainwash Pop Art. We all loved it so much",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karsteno76
30,Its a Pier / Tourist Trap,"It's okay, honestly nothing special. Souvenir shops and overpriced rides. Views are okay but lots of panhandlers trying to make a buck. Did get some boxed water at the pier from a yoga event.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacobs43
50,Fantastic Pier,A fun filled relaxed time with family. Great weather great interaction with locals and good food and great service,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleyshaw2018
40,Pier is great for a photo op but rides expensive,"The pier is lovely, very interesting to walk around. However the rides and games seemed very expensive.Lots of a great places to eat.There are nicer toilets in a nearby park. Do not use the ones just before the entrance.Lots of homeless people one of whom got in my face and made my sons feel uncomfortable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Babesb79
50,Super fun ever if you are here alone,Traveled here from Monrovia all alone using an Uber from Monrovia Hotel where I was for business for the week the weekend came and I stayed an extra few days went here on a Saturday about 6 hours has a nice Beach very busy not many seashells but nice Sandy Beach they also have an amusement area was a huge ferris wheel no you can't ride the ferris wheel alone no single Riders so made friends with the couple next to me who let me join them in their Ferris wheel cart I took their pictures and they took mine it was a load of fun 10 bucks for one ride real great views from a pie they also have other amusement rides since little stores would definitely go back,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Love2Travel100
40,Lots of fun!,I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the Pier. The rides were reasonably priced (compared to the food pries) and my kids really enjoyed it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmKay823
40,Bring your money cause it can get expensive!,5 hot dog on a stick and 3 lemonade was 50 dollars. Riding the roller coaster was 10$ per person. Parking was 15$.Otherwise it's a great iconic stop for everybody! They have really cleaned up recently! Barely and homeless people begging for change or eating out of trash cans or dead people under the Pier(long story).Use the bathrooms on the Pier though!!!If your going for people watching or just to enjoy a nice sunny day I highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SnakPak3
50,Lovely spot and worth the trip,"Beautiful spot! Must see for any tourist and the park down there is lovely to experience, especially with the big ferris wheel.Lots of places to eat, casual and dine in plus the beach walk is great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelBug_83Sydney
30,Very crowded but nice views at night,Well worth a visit but to crowded on Friday night. We only went for a ride on the roller coaster as the lines were very long. 10 $ each is a bit pricey. Lots of places to eat but we went elsewhere for dinner..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eddie-Sweden
20,Dated and in need of a facelift.,Iconic pier has seen better days. Rides are tame and expensive and the actual pier itself (from floorboards to toliets/showers) needs some investment.Beach is great with very strong waves.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helenpY2414QP
50,Superb!,"We are beach lovers at heart and the pier is brilliantly busy with a good mix of souvenirs places, food outlets and rides! The views from the pier are amazing! We went when they were promoting Shark Week and saw some treat pieces of art for Shark statues and got the mandatory free shark foam hat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nelzgirl
20,Coney Island California,"Summed up in one word: schlock.A veritable zoo of people. Hokey tourist junk vendors. Fun amusement park, gorgeous beach views from pier extending way out over the Pacific.Keep hands in your pockets and enjoy the sights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/exNYexMiami
20,Not impressed...,"This place was very recommend when we were in LA. We went there in the afternoon and thought the weather was perfect I did not like the place very much. It is dirty, crowded and not much to see. We enjoyed walking through 3rd street much better. It is much nicer, clean, nice shops and good ambience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NiceJoselyn
30,Landmark!,"We visited the pier as a starting point for a tour we did, how found there toilet lines ridiculously long, especially when you you a little one and I also have Crohns Disease. Given there is one of the most iconic beaches in the world right at your feet more shower blocks and toilets would be highly recommended. The beach was littered with garbage which is a shame for such a beautiful stretch of sand! Park was great although a little busy due to road works.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1385kw
30,Too busy,What used to be a low-key outing with a nice atmosphere turned into an overcrowded attraction where everyone wonders why everyone else is there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MatthijsK67
20,Nice but expensive,"Nice pier, great views, it’s best to cycle from muscle beach where there is plenty of parking.Everything on the pier seemed over priced the arcade are had a lot of broken, worn out machines and the staff were somewhat lacking in being polite.Rides were also nice, however way overpriced for what they were for 10 bucks 1 adult for a 2 minute ride.Even a small coke was 4 bucks.Go for the location, views and forget spending money here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/legodude1983
30,Overcrowded but worth the walk,This historical wooden boardwalk pier is worth a visit even though it is exceptionally crowded and full of the usual tourist shops and trinkets.There were some entertaining performers and some very good views of the ocean and the beach from the end of the pier. There is also a fun fair and other small attractions.Quite a nice walk as long as you don’t stop to buy.Also the end of Route 66!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnieM452
40,Great place to visit when you're in LA,We enjoyed a wonderful day at the Santa Monica Pier. The kids enjoyed all the rides. We also enjoyed some of the food and the atmosphere was wonderful. It's a bit of a tourist trap with too many people there at at any given time. The beach was also phenomenal and will always be in our memories. The pier is a place that everyone needs to visit when they go to Los Angeles,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisandlesley03
40,Nice family spot to visit,"Went with family, including kids and rode a couple of the rides they have on the pier, the Ferris wheel and roller coaster. It was very expensive but we all enjoyed it. It was full of musicians playing (some very good, some not so great) and a few restaurants and shops, people fishing and exercising. Full of life. We had a nice time here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidqtravel
10,Crap,"The beach, broad-walk and pier in Santa Monica were like a scene out of a Ballard novel (a combination of High Rise and Super-Cannes). Unless you are into some of the worst elements of what the American culture can produce then avoid Santa Monica and Venice Beach at all costs.Dangerous at night, grotty in the day. It is clear why most American’s chose Miami Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JasonB612
30,"Busy, busy, busy",Was nice to be by the sea but the pier is so packed. There are rides and eateries like you would find on any pier. A definite must do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Samadison1974
40,Park at nite,Lots of people but must be different at day to appreciate the pacific ocean.Lots of things to see and do.Kids friendly tooo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariehJ616WV
40,Satisfying,Santa Monica is a beautiful place.From the pier you can see these beaches full young people and families all having a lot of fun and stuff. It's very crowded though so I'd suggest either going there early or walking a little far from the pier.I can't say much about the theme park and the arcade games because I didn't go to them but they're very family friendly. You should definitely try them out if you have the time.The only disappointment was the aquarium below the pier. It was very small and pretty boring. I guess maybe if you have little kids it could be interesting somehow because there were activities for them but as a family with teenagers it definitely wasn't worthwhile.Nonetheless Santa Monica as a whole is still a very beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_salmaeliela
40,Santa Monica Pier is a blast!,"Our flight arrived early in the day so we headed straight to Santa Monica Pier. Parking was a breeze—we were there early so we were able to get extremely close and all day parking is inexpensive ($14). Rode rides, played games, it’s expensive but we had a blast. Ferris Wheel is a must as it offers great views. The roller coaster is kid-friendly, no big drops. Stick to the arcade games outside, the indoor arcade can easily be skipped. A lot of the games inside were out of order and some that didn’t have signs would take your money and still not work. Following lunch on the Pier we walked in the surf down to Venice Beach which is a people-watching paradise, then took a $6 Uber back to get the car. Great way to kick off an LA vacation!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/139laurae
20,There is a lot of better places to visit..mm,"This ia as average place about I dont want to write a review.... at all was average and dirty... is this famos santa monica??? Iam sorry... better places:manhattan beach,all beaches in Orange County....Really If You dont have a lot of time,dont go there... because its lost time here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vlk777alfa
40,Good traditional Boardwalk fun,"We spent a nice afternoon on the pier, enjoying the views and also some of there rides on Pacific Pier. The West Coaster was good fun and it was nice to have a look at the midway games and other rides. Something that you should try and do whilst in Los Angeles, you only need an hour or so and then you can enjoy the surrounding stunning beaches",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MCHMF
50,Fascinating,"Bustling with visitors, this is symbolic of the country’s pride in its attractions. I found historical interest as well as excitement in the views. Visited the room at the top of the carousel where they shot a scene for The Sting. Did not take the giant wheel or other rides. Next time maybe. An amazing place. By evening impromptu performances were just beginning.Read the book about it , they have copies on sale. I was lucky. Listened to the stories from the man who wrote the book. Priceless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sathyas914
50,Love everything about it!,"We love the vibe, and beautiful view, bike rental is plenty and not expensive. We used a public bike rental for only 6 dollars an hour, and 16 dollars a day. the dedicated bike trail along the beach is amazing. No need to compete with pedestrians !A lot of shops and eateries around. We loved the juice bar. Parking is relatively easy.Relatively clean and modern compared to some areas in DTLA.Venice beach is a bit over rated in my opinion, but worth checking it out I suppose. Like Newtown or Bondi.Warning! Police is on duty to catch any electric scooters on the bike trail!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/344mingt
10,"Dirty, gross","I came, I saw, I will never go back. Just nasty, dirty and filled with unsavory types. There is a police station right on the pier, what does that tell you? The rides looked chinzy, the souvenir shops were second rate and it just crawls with every type of tourist plus locals trying to scam you out of a buck. It was a nice walk on the beach to get there, but I should have just walked right on by!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TLDWeirton
50,Must see,"We visited the pier hive of activity people everywhere but a very enjoyable experience plenty of fast food outlets ,good views off the beach, fun park on pier is reasonably large, tourist gift shops that sell all tourist stuff,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterdV3835FN
40,Good day out,"Nice walk along the pier. Waves great , more powerful to the left of he pier. Muscle beach (the old one) gives people the chance to show their balance/ monkey bar and tightrope walking. We read the new muscle beach was down at Venice beach. This is like an outdoor gym and is only as good as the people who turn up to use it so was disappointing. Many laces to eat in Santa Monica and great shopping . It's got it all!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helenh376
50,A simple day at the beach,Took a beach towel and hung out with my kid at the beach and the pier. Rode the Ferris Wheel and ate at a hamburger stand on the pier. A beautiful day with some beach fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melodyd337
20,Overrated place,We stopped into check this place out it was so crowded I brought 2 bottles of water for 4 dollars down a little a lady was selling them for 1 dollar each what out for thatPushing through the crowd for what this place is known for there is not much there the little stores there could be more we did not want to go to the fun park the sign End of root66 that was it could be more to it but just disappointed had a quick look and left,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bjf62
40,Good to experience,"Not normally keen on piers but this one has something over others - certainly at sunset anyway. As busy as it is, you can still find peace and space if you seek it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harrison-F-Carter
50,"Grandkids on the Pier, What a great way to spend a beautiful Summer afternoon.","Ok, so for about 12 bucks you can get the kids a bracelet to ride all the rides, a bargain, especially in Southern California. We loved the rides, they were well run, clean and lines very reasonable. Don't ve scared off by the crowds, many are just hanging out. Park right at the pier, don't waste your time looking for parking off site. IT is 15 bucks but well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/840JohnB840
50,Shopping city tour,"This place is beautiful, wonderful, and lively. It has a playground and restaurants on the sea and when you visit the area you should go to the third Street shopping street in the area I advise you to hire bicycles to take a tour of the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/793ahmadz
50,A place of fun,It's one of those places you shouldn't miss when in Los Angeles. You can take a walk down the pier. There are restaurants and souvenir shops on either side of the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sridevit2015
40,Beautiful Pier,Everybody needs to go. Beautiful pier and amazing ocean view! I will just suggest to the city to check the wood screws. Some are dangerous and can cause a severe accident,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chickencita
30,Ehh,Of course you have to go because you saw it on a film or show and yes it's very well known. So by all means go. Just be ready for lines and lots of people as you should be. The restaurants on the pier arent so great but if you're not looking for that you'll be fine. Watch out for those on bikes or rollerblading and be ready to over pay for parking and to play any games.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeverANumber
40,Lots to do,A lovely pier with plenty of eateries and a great arcade! There are toilet (restroom) facilities too and a number of entertainers line the pier. Beautiful at night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justrach
50,Beautiful place to walk and visit,"The Santa Monica Pier is a true gem! We visited the pier nearly every day that we stayed in Santa Monica. It was walking distance from our hotel and there was so much to do. We went to Pacific Park and took tons of photos, we watched the sunset off the pier. It was really a magical place. I do want to make sure you realize that this is truly a ""tourism trap"" and that it is a place for people to sell things, we did purchase several items from the local vendors on the pier because they had good prices and it was all part of the experience. If you don't like touristy things, this may not be the place for you! I would highly suggest going to the end of the pier just before sunset and taking some photos, the view is magical. It is not the cleanest pier I have ever been to but I feel like that is expected since there is constant foot traffic.Sidenote, the corndogs just off the pier are SO GOOD if you need a snack!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ah0wland
10,Do not bother,"Beyond sketchy. Felt incredibly unsafe the entire time. Homeless and panhandlers everywhere. View is tremendous, but the crowd was enormous. Teens and 20-something’s May enjoy it. But not for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fappug55
40,Pier delightful,Lots of fun to visit to see all the activity on the beach and on the pier. Would recommend a morning or late evening stroll to get best views of sunsets and sunrises.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dkayec
50,Wonderful,"Very nice place! Loved, loved, loved the experience! This is one of the most iconic places to visit if you are travelling to L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hoxhakwin
40,Nice pier,"Wasn’t overly impressed but it’s a nice old pier. I enjoyed the old feel of the ambiance. View would have been really nice but it was cloudy. You do have to pay for parking, cash only.Good to visit once, we went super early so it wasn’t too crowded.Bought very nice smelling sunscreen at the gift shop. Nice to walk around, listen to find street music.Don’t know if we would go back but it was nice, quiet, and relaxing. They have benches along the way and some fishing areas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craziique
40,Had to Go!,"There is so much going on at the Pier, and it is iconic, so you have to go...ride the ferris wheel, check out some shops, and just take in the atmoshere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wade29
50,Santa Monica Pier,"The pier is very busy with various stands selling food and souvenirs. Many restaurants are also along the pier. It’s definitely worth seeing when in the area, not only to embrace the atmosphere, but also to enjoy the beautiful views from the end of the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missyk11
40,"Busy, busy place.",We had a meal and then went for a walk out to the end of the pier. There were heaps of people out enjoying the weather and there were plenty of performers and buskers to keep people entertained. It is iconic for the end of Route 66 sign as well and we had to do that. Well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kelvinl508
20,Disappointing!,"I was looking so forward to coming here with the kids. I honestly didn’t feel safe. There were a lot of people selling things, protesting, etc. the arcades were not clean. We took a picture of the sign the end of Route 66 and left. Wouldn’t take young children",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Momwholvsherkids
40,Get there before lunch or you queue for parking,"I parked on the North parking lot which is a bit further from the pier but I am ok with walking at $12 per day parking.The sea was cool but not cold for the 30+°c. Sand was hot under you feet and the beach stretched for miles. Water can be rough with wave knocking me off my feet.Beach facilities was good with rest room and fresh water shower on the beach near the parking lots.The pier was hectic but nice, food ok but souvenir shop was too expensive compared to elsewhere such as Monterey. So good to look We did.not feel like buying.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/328allenp
40,Ride the Ferris Wheel at Santa Monica Peir - Check,"We visited really just to ride the Ferris Wheel. Line wasn't too long on a Sunday night. Worth the $10 to say you did.We got there about 7:00 pm and walked the pier and then back to a restaurant with an upper deck - can't remember the name and can't find it on Google Maps for some reason. It was above a walk-up fast food type place. Waited about 15 minutes for a table, but it was worth it. You get to get out of the crowd!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/937paulettef
40,Standard pier,"The pier was nice, we went at night and it still seemed lively. There was a bit of a queue to park, but parking was fairly easy and standard LA price.We only went on the wheel, which was fun, but a little overpriced for a standard fairground ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/58elliem
40,Classic SoCal experience !,If you are visiting Southern California you've got to experience this place once! It is just a classic experience that you've got to try. Nothing extraordinary to do but well worth the trip,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/713jackc
30,Must see one time,The famous Santa Monica pier is a must see one time. Great views out on the pier of the coast line. It was very crowded. Bathrooms on the pier which was helpful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cw0108
40,GOOD TIME,We had a fun time. The pier is great. Crowds were heavy and price of rides is a bit high but it’s worth it for the photos!!!! Go enjoy!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theleespartyof4
20,"Crowded, chaotic, expensive",This is probably a must-do for the LA experience but it’s not very enjoyable. Masses of people and parking is difficult especially at sunset. Souvenirs and food are very expensive and not much variety. We enjoyed the street performers. Pretty at night but watch your belongings.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennyr358
30,Too crowded on a hot day,"This pier is more of an entertainment area. There are a couple of cafes and restaurants plus many small shops. The walk to the pier is nice, busy with people enjoying the beautiful scenes of the ocean and also sandy beach.The walk would be more comfortable on a less hot and sunny day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellingBoneDoctor
50,Great time,We got there at sunset so it was lit up. People were performing and fishing off the end of the pier. The food was a bit pricey though and not much room to sit. Parking was hard to find but it was a great walk and experience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaymarie12
40,Great nighttime visit,A very famous attraction that did not let us down. The neon lights at night and the whole seaside feel gives this place a happy buzz. Somegood rides and plenty pf places to eat. You are probably better off eating and parking around 2nd or 3rd streer and walking down.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joep735
50,Must see it,"There’s something about this pier that’s both kitschy and nostalgic. Even though it’s very crowded, it is a place to definitely visit while in LA. You don’t have to stay long, just long enough to walk to the end of the pier and admire the water views. Or stay awhile and ride the Ferris wheel for even better views. We found parking in one of the buildings just 2-3 blocks away, and parking was free if you stayed under 3 hours. What a good find.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toujourstravel
30,Famous pier failed to impress.,"Visited for a few hours as part of an organised trip. Busy spot in Summer time. Had a half hour talk giving the history of the Pier. Kinda interesting but not required.There are many amusements, food stalls, restsurants and shops etc located along the length of the Pier. Some of these more iconic than others. Do check out the Forrest Gump seat and the End of Route 66 sign. You will queue for a photo opportunity at both those spots.Public restrooms are available. Lines will exist.For us the best part of the visit was the fantastic sea views. The Pacific looked stunning and the sea breeze divine.Car parking is available but of course there is a charge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dsrob26
30,Tick - Pier Walked,It was great to visit as I suppose you see it featured in lots of movies. Enjoyed watching the locals fish off the pier and the buskers entertain. We didn't go on any rides or eat at the pier but enjoyed out walk. You could easily walk from the train station to the pier. It was nice to see the ocean and enjoy the summer breezes but full of tourists like us.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yvonneh203
40,Day trip,Great summer sunset & lots of events for the family to participate. Summer heat is quite unbearable so bring your sun tan lotion of lots of water to replenish your loss of water,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterjennypauljo
50,Worth seeing!!,"We loved our time there. Be prepared for traffic, parking issues and lots of tourists. But, it was all worth it. I’d suggest trying to find parking closest to the pier, there’s usually some great hidden parking stalls near the pier, you just have to be determined and patient to drive around a bit to find one. If you can’t find one close by there is a parking garage up the road from the pier entrance. There’s quite some interesting entertainers there especially at sunset. Best part of our time there was playing on the beach, eating churros, and watching the sunset. By all means, go enjoy the rides and shops too 😉",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judzv2016
40,"Nice place, lot of people","Good place for a promenade. You'll find a lot of thing to do.At the old arcade, yo'll find back oldies video games... I went back in childhood :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Olivier7411
30,Busy!,"We went to Santa Monica to visit the beach and see what the hype was about. It was ok, quite busy with tourists and some locals.Great for families as the kids can enjoy the rides or hit the beach.We had lunch at one of the food courts at the nearby shopping centers as there was limited options for food at the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swishmishS
50,A walk to the pier,"II was staying at a nearby hotel and decide to walk to the pier. Yes it's touristy but fun. Restaurants, ice cream, other nearby hotels. Plenty of rides and fun for all. Great views. Take it all n",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesmD8349HS
30,Checked Off Bucket List,"We saw a sea lion in the water and you can fish off the pier, but unsure about the exact regulations as we did not actually fish ourselves. There were live performances and people asking for donations. I can’t upload video, but there was a older man that was painted in gold and later taken by ambulance out of the area. We had some explaining to do with our children because we watch him perform, gave money to him, and he gave our Granddaughter a Slinky toy. She was upset to see this and we hope he was ok. There are people there trying to make a dime and just be prepared for that type of thing. Several people shouting how evil the world is and how you should repent before you go to that hot place. No matter what side of the fence you are on this it may be place that you discuss things beforehand with young kids. We ate at Bubba Gump’s and we participated in a trivia contest about the movies. Public beach, but we strictly were tourists that checked this off bucket list. Been there- Done that!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shereetravel
50,Great place to escape during layover at LAX,We decided to spend our layover on this trip at the pier. Definitely plan for traffic and on you way back. We had a great time at the pier. We partook in the amusement rides and games. We then walked the pier which was full of artists and musicians. We then went down to the beach for a bit to relax and enjoy the water.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z935GJgregs
40,Sunset on the Pier,Nice view. Lots of things to do. Rides...great sunset. Live music.I would go back. Good for all ages,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/125jacquelinet
30,Fun experience,"Recently took a couple of our grandchildren (ages 10 & 12) & they enjoyed themselves. Only a handful of rides however it the location that is the draw- right on the ocean. The ""all you can ride) ticket seems reasonably priced. Its an experience- not in the class of a major theme park but then again they aren;t on the ocean either.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pwood2018
50,Fun in the sun,"This is a fun place with rides, food and a relaxed, carnival beach atmosphere. Hit the waves or just view the horizon and waves... fun for all ages. Even more beautiful at night with all the colored lights",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/naneliz
30,"Too Crowded, Little of Interest","In former times this was an amusing place to go to, but now its just dense crowds and noise, punctuated with low-grade amusements. The carousel even operated without music.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MannyG2000
40,A Little Disappointing,"Considering all the hype about this iconic landmark I was expecting something much more impressive. It was nice to finally see it, but in reality it's just a small amusement park. I would have enjoyed seeing the historic carousel and other historic buildings there, but they were closed when we went. It certainly has a beautiful view and a broad beach below, so in good weather I can see how it would be a popular haunt.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryjon2016
50,Disappointing,"I can’t imagine how such a touristic place is not prepared for an electricity outage.The theme park had to issue refunds to all its visitors and the restaurants stopped serving people, so we had to leave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WassimZe
50,Another must see,This is another must see on a trip to LA. You can’t be mor iconic than the Santa Monica pier. Lots of shops and restaurants along the pier and all of the blocks around the area including the 3rd Street Promenade.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markmK1320UG
50,Fun,"This is a fun space for young people, they have food, souvenirs, an arcade and some games.There is a mall and good restaurants around and now they have some cool scooters that you can get for almost free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/954irasemad
30,Lively but noisy,"Have lived in Los Angeles 36 years and I have been here twice. The rides are good for kids. There is action and noise. As a localI rarely come here, but there are mobs of people who do. Convenient to the metro, so more folks can come from in from the LA sprawl. Sometimes there are nice events/ music.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dziran
50,A Complete Beach experience,"Once one of my very good friends shared an anecdote about Santa Monica, that the first time she saw it, she was so mesmerized by its beauty that she had decided to marry someone from Los Angeles only so that she could settle in there and visit Santa Monica anytime she wanted to. Well, I wasn't fortunate enough to visit it that early in my lifetime to think likewise :)In reality, I would still not blame her because it was one of the most complete beaches/ pier that I have visited in some time. The beach line is long and the background across the driveway is picturesque. There is ample parking and even if not the cleanest of all, it is a relatively well maintained beach. If walking on sand is not your cup of tea, you could take the pathway kissing the road to reach the pier. The ocean of course is a view to cherish and there are so many activities that children could do at the beach.The pier also was unique with the ramp nosing to a fair distance into the sea. There is variety in terms of places to eat, things to do and then just to gaze at things. I loved sitting on one of the benches and staring at the sea gulls, listing to the talented street performers, looking at the waves going past the wooden pillars.My little one enjoyed running around chasing the birds and even after spending a good 4 hours we were so not ready to leave. There were stunning photo opportunities and we did not miss too many of them.The only thing that did disappoint me was the quality of the food, If you have a choice try something in the city or maybe eat at somewhere where I did not( They were so forgettable that I can't remember their names)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SKaRoy
10,WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,"Unless you are planning on swimming and making a day of it and going on rides, huge waste of time. The pier is uneven and hard to walk on for seniors and those pushing baby strollers. There are vendors for food and people selling stuff, some blocking stairways. You wait in lines to park, pay $14.00 plus dollars, then walk to the end of the pier and back about 15 and you’re done. If I had to do it again, I wouldn’t!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/234normal
50,Depends on when you go,So a stroll on Sunday night was crazy busy! People everywhere! Returning Monday morning around 9 am was pleasurable because we could walk faster and peer over the fencing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HyMaryland
30,Nice to visit,We wanted to tick this off the list. It's a nice historic pier but gets very busy in the summer. They could do with controlling the hawkers selling buckets and spades etc as the block steps on and off the pier as this causes problems.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/26AndrewB
40,Beautiful and fun,"Nothing beats a walk down the pier with the ocean breeze in your face. There is every kind of fast food item you can imagine and some sit down restaurants. Amusement rides and games for the kids, street musicians and performers. We love going there at night because of the light and the singing/musical talent. We even say a Mariachi singer dressed as the President. It gets a little crowded, hold onto you kids. The beach gets a little sketchy at night with the increasing homeless population. We were never approached or panhandled, just be careful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/118randys
50,Great people watching,"Had a nice time at the pier at the end of a Saturday. Yes, it was crowded, but that was part of the attraction. Lots of fun things to do and see. The only problem with the pier is getting there. You really have to know where you are going to park first and then have about three other options because the lots are usually filled after mid day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/graycalhoo
40,Lots of fun,"Fun, fun, fun, with the park rides and game booths and f&b options. It is a very leisurely walk down the pier. The indoor game shop could be revamped for a better and more modern appeal and also some shops are closed for renovation. It'll be better if all shops are open.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alyf38
20,Very average,"Was described to me as the Coney Island of the west coast, it's not, it's crowded with a few fairground rides and fast food. Had the ticket as part of an explorer pass. Saw the price of the tickets, wouldn't pay it for what we got. The only one of our family that enjoyed it was the 5 year old and even she said the rides were slow.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richyintipp
20,Once is enough,"Ugh! I guess it’s one of those things you have to do if you come to Santa Monica but as soon as you do, you regret it. Honestly, if you can just stay up by the sign, you’ll be fine and say you saw it. You’ll miss a million churro and mango sellers, as well as being sweating hot and running into 5 thousand children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Millerdes
40,Needs improvement,"I was here last year and had an amazing experience. This year it wasn’t as good. It is very crowded, as to be expected. This time I went and I could smell a lot of weed, like it was making me nervous because I don’t want it to show up on a drug test type of smell. There were a lot of passed out homeless people in the area. They weren’t bothering anyone, but it was very disturbing to see people just laid out on the way to the pier. Guys with signs begging on the pier. I hope they can clean it up and get some help for the homeless people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StephanieSelene
30,Mainly aimed at children,The rides here are most suited for children. The pier gets rather crowded however you do get very good views both towards the land and the sea.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Betula103
40,Enjoyable walk,We spent an enjoyable couple of hours wandering around the pier. We had a go on the roller coaster which was fun. Lots of tacky souvenirs to buy and lots of wacky people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/803mattp
40,A landmark for all times of day,"We stayed just a 20 minute walk from the Pier which we walked towards most days. Iconic landmark and a night looks stunning. It's a bustling hive of tourists and locals, offering fairground rides, food, live music from organised to busking. It's the END or BEGINNING of the famous Route 66. You can park on the pier too. People fishing, movies being shot or just to sit and while the time away. It's a living breathing community. I have been there as a lone traveler and also with teens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurawU8531TO
50,Santa Monica Pier,We had a blast. Lots to do with teens. Don't forget to bring a jacket as it gets a little chilly when the sun starts to set.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/156biancae
40,Iconic and scenic,"We went to the Santa Monica pier on a Sunday morning around 10:30AM. It was very crowded since it was a weekend but we still took our dog and walked all along the pier. It was neat seeing the iconic pier and had beautiful views on the beaches and Santa Monica. We enjoyed listening to a child violinist who was very talented as well as a singer at the end of the pier, and there are all kinds of art/souvenir stands in addition to the typical fair food vendors and fair rides. There was no parking close by that we could find that was under $20 but we parked at the civic center for $2.00 and walked which was very convenient and saved money if you are willing to walk a little to get there. It was neat seeing the end of Route 66 sign and taking photos with that and the Santa Monica pier signs. Might be a little overrated but it is iconic and worth it if you are in the area already (and would be fun to take kids as well).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilytO6138AN
50,Iconic and beautiful,Santa Monica pier is a must-go-to place if you’re planning on visiting. It exudes an air of hard to find true remaining authenticity in Santa Monica spirit that was here during early times. I would recommend coming early in the day avoid most of the crowds or late in the evening to see the sunset and have a margarita at the end of the pier!In general the restaurants that are on the pier are pretty decent and I would definitely go for a few rides if you have the chance. It can be a memorable and romantic experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MLondon26
40,Family fun on the pier,Certainly something to see - bit of a circus sideshow atmosphere but fun - exactly what you would expect and without the sleaze factor of venice beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mchaleassoc
40,Fun place to spend an afternoon/evening,Beautiful beach and surrounding scenery with food and fun. Likely one of the most beautiful areas in S California.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skiang
40,I love Santa Monica Pier,"Okay Santa Monica Pier can be a nightmare full of too many people and long lines. It also has a great theme park on the pier, how many places can you ride a rollercoaster next to the ocean. Love the games and walking the pier just brings back good memories. Plus it's fun to watch the beach goers from the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimikor
40,Better than Venice Beach,"It was one of the better beaches I have been to, lot of attractions, food, music, arts and people even the strange ones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dameont2018
50,Amazing Boardwalk,"This was on my bucketlist. I am so glad we went. It was crowded, but we loved the boardwalk. The view was spectacular. We walked around the beach too. It was a lot of fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fearless57874521571
50,Great views,Walking on the pier we were able to see far out into the ocean and some of the houses built into the hills. There was a lot of rides and entertainment for small children and adults. UCLA also provides a sunscreen station that or provides free sunscreen. It is very pretty when the lights are in at night too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oharac2017
30,Nothing too exciting about it...,"We're glad we visited it, though there wasn't much to see. The rides were definitely targeted towards children - so we would recommend visiting here if you have young kids. But the adult scene wasn't super exciting. We saw all we needed to within 30 minutes of arriving. Gorgeous view of the ocean and clean beach nearby, though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Sharks88
30,Sightseeing,Crowded and a ton of kids playing pokemon Go. Food is a little overpriced but still good. Not a lot to do but the scenery is amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DamienWayneRR
20,Santa Monica Pier was a let down,"I took my grown daughter to the Santa Monica Pier, as I enjoyed it years ago at night. Driving there on Sunday morning, there were so many homeless people, she did not even want to get out of the car! WE drove all the way down and she kept asking me to leave, that is how bad it was. It was Sunday morning around 9:30 am. I felt bad even taking her, as I had no idea what it has turned into since my last visit years ago.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ddunngross
30,Crowded and loud,"It was interesting to visit and nice to be able to say we've been there since it is an iconic part of American roadside history, but really it's just a pier with rides on it. Every 50 feet or so you pass another extremely loud performer- really I wish they would have a decibel limit, it would be so much more enjoyable.We walked to the end and back and then spent the rest of our time on the beach and swimming- which was much more fun.Traffic and parking was a complete nightmare.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gypsymamma
50,Amazing view at sunset,We went there on a Sunday night.. parked a ways away..but who can complain when you are walking next to the ocean.. lots of people to watch.. we just came to see the sunset and was not disappointed. It is a really cool place to visit and it is a short walk to a mall area..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikegjones79
30,Very very crowded,Similar to Jersey shore boardwalks we frequently visit back home. We went there to say we did it. Went on a Saturday afternoon and it was bustling with people. We took our pictures and left. Definitely get a taste of local culture on the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amcarpenter123
40,Last day walk around,Good old traditional pier as described. Visited on a Sunday and traffic was mental. Loads of cars bumper to bumper. Very busy and buzzing area. Defo worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobster1973
30,Over-rated,"Yes - good to see this famous pier, but really over crowded and over rated. Imagine the amusement park at Southsea put on the Bournemouth pier on a good day in the summer and you’ve more or less seen it!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R1625SRdeborahh
40,Iconinc pier worth the stop,"Pacific Park has some nice rides, and the price didn't seem to be too outrageous as far as theme parks go. Good assortment of amusement park food and entertainment. The view from atop the Ferris Wheel is great! Make it a part of a day on the Venice Beach Boardwalk (about a $5 Uber ride - or a long walk - away).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dan1724
30,Too many tourist on the pear,"The pear lost its end of route 66 spirit with so many tourist and small vendors here an there. If you want a fair, let's go there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benoit2soulie
40,Summer Holiday,"Very busy place, got there morning time and beautiful pier and beach, water around pier is quite dirty from rubbish and we did see a few homeless people eating out of the rubbish bin. Must do is a bike ride from the pier to Venice beach it takes around 20 minutes and can do at your leisure, lots to see along the way and if an eye opener but so glad we did it !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/979mandys
40,Iconic pier amid nice coastal area,A pier is a pier and SM is tacky just like the rest of them. Rides are in expensive and not very thrilling so I would suggest saving your money and people watching before having a drink at one of the cool bars along the front.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marklound
10,Drive-by and keep going...,"We decided to stop at the famous pier while driving Highway 1. What a mistake! This beach town reminded me of Seaside Heights, NJ or Wildwood, NJ. I felt very uncomfortable walking around. It was very crowded. Nothing special. There were rides which we avoided. Honestly just couldn’t wait to get back into the car to continue driving. Traffic was terrible and easiest parking is the parking garages. We parked, walked to the pier, walked to the end of the pier, then walked back to our car and left. There are so many other pleasant beach towns along Highway 1, skip this one and head to another.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/676terrianner
50,"Busy, hectic, a blast","My husband and I visited on a very busy Sunday evening. It was heaving with couples, families and groups of friends; and there were a few buskers too - enjoyed the older violinist doing covers of pop tunes. We walked all along to the end of the pier, past lots of kiosks selling food or souvenirs, enjoying watching the visitors on the beach and in the sea. There are few restaurants including a Bubba Gump. The fun fair glows as the sun goes down. A proper tourist icon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenm442
50,Check off the bucket list!,"I absolutely LOVED Santa Monica Pier! Ever since the Lost Boys came out when I was younger, I had always wanted to go see this place! Lol it’s beautiful! The water, the pier... loved it! I love people watching also! Rides are a bit expensive, but we did the Ferris wheel of course, and it was great! Although the only down side..... I didn’t see any vampires here... haha go see this attraction!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shelly0310
20,Stay away,"The first thing I noticed on the pier was the noise. Loud announcements were coming from a speaker telling people that Jesus could save them. Two people were handing out brochures about Jesus. The walk to the end of the pier was crowded and claustrophobic. We passed cheesy souvenir stands and musicians ( some were great; others were horrible). At the end of the pier where people were fishing we were rewarded with a nice view of the ocean and a cute little sea lion swimming around and poking its adorable face out of the water. There are not too many places to just sit and people watch. It’s like being stuck on one of those moving sidewalks at the airport. There is a swimming beach nearby. I heard the water was freezing so we didn’t want to try it. But some people were in the water. There is a lot of nice shopping near the pier, especially the Third Street Promenade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WherecanI_gonext
40,Start of the day,First thing we did in Santa Monica once parked. Obligatory pictures in front of the Route 66 sign. Long pier very similar to those in England. Therefore expect all sorts on it. And that includes the people. Plenty of tourist shops and places to eat. Lots of rides but not open at 9am. Big Parking lot right in front of it handy and $14 all day parking. A must if visiting Santa Monica.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnselmColom
40,"Off the plane, to the pier....","This is a good place to stretch your legs and start to appreciate what LA is, a huge city, with a stunning coastline and natural beauty, and lots of people out in it. The pier is the end of old Route 66.The pier and surrounding area are very walkable, and the little amusement park is recognizable from several movies. There are places to eat, public restrooms, and, of course the ocean.When approaching, keep going towards the pier if you want close parking. Because of the elevation change between the town and beach, It appears the road ends. We ended up parking in town an walking, which was actually a nice stroll. Santa Monica was actually cleaner and newer than I expected, and there were renovations happening on one of the main streets. Lots of folks walking and biking. There must be some homeless issues still, because some sections did smell like an outdoor urinal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BuddyV_12
40,Santa Monica Pier,"Visited to join star's home's tour. Plenty small barrows selling tourist items. Can be busy, and we didn't get time to tryout the rides, completely,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/262vall
30,Nice place for a quick visit,Nice historic pier that is crowded. Lots of touristy souvenir kiosks and street performers along the way as well as several restaurants and ice cream shops. Fishing off the end. Seemed to be mostly tourists when we there during day and early evening and not a lot of locals. Parking for $15 is nearby on beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/233DougR
30,Nice walk,"I went early before the evening crowd. Its a nice Pier with Playland arcade for kids and adults if you like rollercoaster or wheel tours. There are a couple of restaurant directly on the Pier, Bubba Gump shrimp,Mexican Mariasol, and more as you step on the Pier. Lots of gift stores. I walked to the end. I enjoyed reading the history of the Pier, and finding out Santa Monica claims ""Popeye"" the sailor, cartoons I watched as a kid, was based on a real sailor's life in Santa Monica, Olaf Olsen. Really! I thought ""Popeye"" is from Chicago! I thought the place too touristy. Its worth walking to the end. Bring towels to hang at the beach after or before.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancyDayton_Ohio
40,"Oceanfront amusement park, housed on an over-sized pier","Oceanfront amusement park, housed on an over-sized pierSanta Monica Pier is packed with eateries, rides, games and other amusement park attractions, and also a portion which is like a normal pedestrian pier. We came here with young kids, so it was exciting for them, and we got much joy watching them being excited, happy and enjoying things not available to us when we were young. I’ve been here many times, as I used to be associated with a business located nearby, on Santa Monica Blvd.This is a pier like no other. About 70% of the surface area of this irregular-shaped pier is over land. It is home to eateries (including Bubba Gump Shrimp Co., Mariasol (Mexican), The Albright (seafood), Pier Burger(Had burgers and fries here. They were great.), Ristorante Al Mare (Italian), Rusty's Surf Ranch (seafood and bar eats), Coffee Bean, lots of fast food eateries, and more), Pacific Wheel (Ferris wheel), Guro Loop (This made my head spin), West Coaster (roller coaster), Pacific Plunge (cabled free-fall ride), Sea Dragon, Santa Monica Pier Carousel, souvenir shops, Pacific Park’s rides for little kids, entertainment arcades with over 200 games, and more. On weekends and holidays, the pier is very crowded.At the deeper end of the pier, we saw a few people fishing, and some had caught fish.There are many things one can do in the vicinity of the Pier. The biggest being enjoying the beach. After enjoying the Pier, we walked two blocks to 3rd Street Promenade, for shopping and people-watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KodoDrummer
50,Great time.,"Fun, lots to do, plenty of restaurants nearby. Loved Bubba Gump's right at the pier, plenty of night life, shopping, bars, restaurants, so much fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/newmansa09
40,Good to Visit at least once,The pier was really cool with the rides on them. It was fun to drive onto the pier in park there as well. The rides are not that great if you've gone to Universal before or while you're in Southern California unless your kids are pretty young these would not be exciting rides. Not as many jobs as I expected but the beaches were nice and clean and the bike paths were nice the exercise areas where need so it's worth a visit at least once.Now my best advice would be to spend one day here and then spend the rest of your time in Huntington Beach. Huntington Beach is so nice compared to every other Beach we went to lots of room tons of beach very very clean and lots of shops and places to eat. Huntington Beach was the best place we saw and we will stay there next time we're in Southern California,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrishN1267WN
30,Good place to see,"I visited Santa Monica Pier during my trip to LA. I didn’t stay very long so I wasn’t able to experience the entire area. However, the area is a major attraction with lots of things to do and the normal street performers. It gets crowded in the evenings and finding parking may be a little difficult. I didn’t see any free parking close by so be prepared to pay about $15 for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dean156
30,Average/very good,First of all we enjoyed this and recommed going to have a look. But the ride prices we felt were over the top. Maybe this was because we had been to universal studios the day before. We did enjoy visiting this iconic location and worth a look.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/damoswan1
20,TMPJJPP,"We were excited to visit the Santa Monica Pier, we have been to the Santa Cruz Board Walk in the past. We were very disappointed. Very crowed, very few rides, and very over priced! I guess it’s nice to say we’ve been there, but save your money and go somewhere else!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tenellep
40,My the sea,First do not miss the carousel. It is old and beautiful and free. The ice cream parlour has good drinks to cool down on a hot day. The pier is definitely a hub of activity. The buskers are good fun to watch. The amusement rides are good fun. The stalls have interesting gift options. Do not forget the end of Route 66 sign. A perfect photo opt. A great way to spend the afternoon. You can even go fishing off the pier if you want to,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/415elfriedem

Traffic and parking is very tough to manage.FYI sometimes they shut down traffic heading down to be pier because of crowding. When leaving we had to meet our Uber driver at the top of the pier.Overall it was a neat visit. Plenty of street entertainment, lots of eateries and excitement. The sunset is beautiful as it sets over the hills.Unfortunately not enough time to visit the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/263jasonb

My first visit in Santa monica pier is 10yrs ago but it wasn't as crowded as it is now. It's still a great place for a side trip if you dont live in LA, it's worth going, just to see it for yourself since this place is always featured in many movies and TV shows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/498gaill
40,Touristy pier. Dirty beach. But good people watching place.,"We visited back in September 2016 (TripAdvisor wouldn’t allow me to put time before sep 2017) and had a fair experience.

40,Nice for a couple of hours!,"We chose our hotel based on being near the Pier. I must say, I am glad I saw it, however-some restaurants, rides, shops....DONE. Definitely not a destination.

40,Iconic Location,"It’s old, but that contributes to its charm. A must go to spot at any time of day as part of a trip to Santa Monica. Features some rides, arcades and everything a pier would have in its prime. They even have Zoltar, which definitely took me back to my child hood",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GavinWongUK
40,Crowded but Fun,I always feel like I am stepping back into my childhood even though I did not grow up in LA. It is because they used the pier in a lot of TV shows. Especially 3's Company. The carousel is still there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HungryDave1

50,A must do and see while visiting California!!!,"I came here on a Thursday afternoon while visiting LA. Commuted here from the 7th Street Metro Station downtown LA and took the Expo Line and this was the last stop. This is a very convenient way to travel to/from without the hustle and bustle of driving and trying to find a parking space. The train station is a block from the entrance of the Santa Monica Pier, once you walk over the bridge you are entering into a fun filled adventure which takes you back into time of a old timer boardwalk. I live in Chicago and we have a similar attraction called Navy Pier its nice but not as much to do and see as they have here.We walked the Boardwalk grab some food, took lots of pictures which is spot on for a good scenic op and headed down the walkway towards Venice Beach. This route was so nice, everyone walking or taking in the scene by renting a bike or scooter which is a brilliant idea. However, we just walked there and enjoyed the route. Once we made it to Venice Beach there were a lot of vendors, stores and eateries. We spent the entire evening there as the sun went down. We opted to do the scooter rental back and that was nice because after the long walk we enjoyed the ride back. Again, this is a definite stop while visiting the area. I highly recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ez2cyunvtee

The amusements are mostly for kids, but hey: a ride at the Ferris wheel is a great thing if you wanna look on things from above. The rest? No, I’d say have a look at it from a distance and save your money for some shopping or hire a bike/electric scooter for a tour at the boardwalk instead.

30,Meh,"As a Chicago native with the exception of the ocean vs our lake, I find this to be kinda meh. For kids it's probably a lot of fun, but it's not horrible. The rides are just 'ok' and the carnival games are what they are. However, the view and the performers make it decent. I heard a very talented 9 year old violinist here.Another addition on the rides- I personally think they're overpriced. I got a wristband as part of the LA Go pass so I tried out 3 of them. The ferris wheel is always relaxing, but I wouldnt pay the 10 bucks they charge tbh.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imrico
50,End of the trail!,The views are great from the pier. They have limited rides & games but we still enjoyed our time there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisav974
40,Great time on the beach in family,"We were not lucky, by the time we got on the beach, it was cloudy but we still enjoyed the atmosphere at the beach. Lot, and lot of people. If you get there by car, expect to pay $15 for the parking. There are many restaurant along the beach where you can eat. In terms of the beach, it is very clean despite the number of people who visit. I preferred Santa Monica beach to Venice Beach, specially if you are with kids. Venice beach are more for teens or young twenties. Santa Monica Beach has an entertainment park which kids below 10 will love.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clippe
30,Not worth the effort,"If you have time on your hands in Los Angeles, I suppose it's worth the effort, but I wouldn't bother. It's not nearly as interesting as the Fisherman's Wharf area of San Francisco, and is very touristy. Go if you're desperate to see the end of the old Route 66, but that's about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DRCsydney
30,"Fun to visit, not a must see",The boardwalk has many visitors from all over. Street performers and political activist. Food vendors and some dated carnival type rides. The ferris wheel did look fun but $10 a ride seemed a little steep. It was an ok visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/royalpalmshade
40,Very touristic ....,"Very touristic, nice view but nothing special, especially at busy times. We liked more the biking along the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yolyni
30,Rather crowded,"It is one of those tick the boxes place, if your in Santa Monica you have to do it. I've done box ticked",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelkQ2088AE
30,Old and crowded,"I could not tell if this is the place that locals go or tourist. As a tourist, I would not ride any of the rides. I did not even look at the prices, but I am sure they would have been disappointing. The pier could use some updating as far as maintenance goes. Maybe if I was a teenager, I might have enjoyed it more, but then again, the kids all said it was boring. We paid $15 to park, so we decided to leave the pier and walk around downtown. That was slightly better. Found a few good places to eat and it made up for the lacking pier. There was also some kind of police activity around all the electric scooters on the trails. There maybe some restrictions about renting them and were they can be used.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelarH6496UI
30,Touristy,"We went here in December, and it must have been the best time to visit. While there were still people around, it was nothing like the amount of people in late June / July when we went again. It was hard to even walk to / from the pier and the beach because of the amount of people. Smells of urine and pot all around, which was disgusting.Lots of good people watching and being next to the ocean was awesome, but there are better beaches in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luv2travel22018
30,Disappointing,"A bit dirty, too tourist. Thought it would be better maintained, Santa Monica beach...a variety of restaruants",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ariehe2013
50,FUN. FUN. FUN.,"You have to visit this place at least once in your life. It's like stepping out of real life and into a movie or video game!The pier has food, fun and music, it's a thriving and great place to hang out. From the rollercoaster to the famous wheel, even the food and coffee is great! There are a range of activities for kids too young for the rides including a huge arcade and multiple fairground games!I really think the pier is perfect for a couple first date, or a family experience! Also check out the shrimp at Bubba Gump, even if you're not a seafood person, it'll surprise you ;)GO AND ENJOY IT!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngelXena
50,Great family fun!,"We had such a fun time at the Pier! Parking was super convenient and not too pricey. We paid $12 for 4 hours. We decided to get wristbands so we could go on unlimited rides (they were super pricey if you paid for each ride). The rides were like what you would find at a carnival, but we had a blast. The short lines were an added bonus (especially after spending 3 days at Disney & Universal). There are lots of places to get food from sit down restaurants to quick bites (hot dogs, pizza, hamburgers, etc.). We were a little bummed because it was overcast when we were there, but we'll definitely return so we can spend time on the beach as well!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MamaLulu520
40,Pretty fun!,It seems to be mostly for kids but the pier rides were still fun. Def get an LA go card for the deals here. The ice cream at Scoops was the best thing but it's expensive- 7 and some change for one scoop! But I could barely finish it so I guess its worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C4904VQkatiew
50,Fun day at the Pier,"My teenagers were big Hannah Montana fans years ago so they wanted to visit the place where the final scene was filmed. The Ferris wheel was so much fun and the roller coaster was a great thrill! We had a nice lunch at the restaurant on the pier, and we even hungout on the beach for a few hours. Definitely worth a day trip here if you are in the area!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shaydel4kids
20,Not what we were expecting,"All of the family thought this visit was a bust. We have teens and a 7 year old. While it was enjoyable to see and get a few iconic photos, it wasn’t the great pier amusement park we thought it would be. Personally I was expecting a bit more old-timey and classic. It was more modern carnival. Prices were high, which I wholly expected for this venue. It’s a crowded place (we were there on a Wednesday morning). Parking was easy and cheap (I think we paid $2 for two hours). I am glad we stopped to experience the pier, get a few photos, ride a coaster on the pier, and check it off the must-visit-list. We were there less than two hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayBird411_MN
40,Iconic place in Los Angeles,For me it's a must see in Los Angeles. Very very crowded though (we were there in July). Lots of places to grab a snack - nice,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kalwf
10,"Dirty, but fun.",Is it really necessary that everything on this pier has to be so filthy?I guess it’s better that the alternative of washing it all into an already dirty ocean because of this pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChefRudiPicard
40,So great!,I wish there was more to do there but it’s really great to see it. It’s special in its own way and really great. Lots of food and shops. A ton of people. Like crazy amount but still great. Its a quick stop nothing long. But we just walked around the beach after.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristinamoskv
30,Lots of people,"If lots of people in confined spaces is your thing, then this is the place for you. Just people everywhere. Too many for my liking. Neat to just say that's somewhere you've been.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meganlucas09
50,The end of the road.,Santa Monica pier was everything that we had imagined it to be. We visited it on our last night of our whirlwind tour of the USA. We had a go on the big wheel then our last meal with our fellow travelers at the Bubba Gump restaurant . With this being the official end to Route 66 it was a fitting end tour our Journey across the USA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fraserfritz
50,Trip to Santa Monica Beach and Pier,"We had a blast at the beach and pier in Santa Monica! The beach is big and clean and the water was wonderful! That night we went back to the pier, bought wristbands and stayed until closing time! This was the best day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristinkeith2018
50,Very Exciting for people watching,This is a very crowded place but worth the experience. Very interesting people around and beautiful beach views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/963ShelleyC963
30,It’s a busy pier,With all the tackiness of a busy pier. So you know what you are getting when you head down. No surprise really busy at the weekend and pricey given the captive audience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ndwalsh
30,Overrated and crowded,I highly recommend to visit the pier during the week...otherwise you will be stuck on the pier without doing anything...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bofa81
40,Traditional,Nice place to slide back in time - still a miracle with the big ferrywheel over the ocean - opens at 11am for fun,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dennys34
40,'End of Route 66',"As my partner and I had just finished driving Route 66 after 3 weeks this was the 'finishing post' for us.We were there 4th July weekend so very busy, but there was a great family atmosphere, everyone enjoying themselves.We had our photos taken by the guy in the Route 66 booth and claimed our certificate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susieb20
50,Nice atmosphere on a sunny fah,Well worth a visit for a great atmosphere on a sun shining day. We love the walk from Venice Beach to Santa Monica Pier and will always come here during a visit to LA. Definitely the nicer part of the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlotteKirsch
30,Family holiday,Was a little bit underwhelmed with the whole Santa Monica Pier. But saying that I’m glad we went and experienced it. Would still recommend for others to go and experience it too,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jaimeerol
50,Gotta do it!,"Can't think of a reason not to visit Santa Monica Pier if you're in the area. It's free! I think the weather is just about always lovely! Best people watching! Random acts-music, magic, art. Fun snacks. Easy breezy vibe!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RetiredMJJ
50,Gorgeous,"Came her to watch the sunset, managed to catch it while on the wheel. Absolutely magical! The fair itself isn’t anything spectacular but the views and the whole atmosphere of the place is wonderful, an absolute must see",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glos690
50,I loved it!!,We visited Sabra Monica pier at the sunset and I fell in the love with the place. Amazing view of the sea and the colours in the sky. Like in the movies ;),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jen_pss0
30,Nothing special,"Went here at the end of our Route66 trip and were seriously underwhelmed. A nothing special fairground, some shops and several places to eat. Kind of expected a bit more. The best part was the views of the Pacific and along the beaches.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/839iaina
50,So Serene!,"I visited here with my husband and son late afternoon/ early evening. We sat on the pier which was so lovely, looking over the beach, watching the sunset as live jazz was being played in the background. I felt so at peace there.We loved that there was a park right next to the pier. Our son enjoyed this! We also managed to find a fantastic restaurant just opposite.Overall, lovely evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FoodieL_13
50,Busy busy pier..,"Extremely busy pier. Seemed like a huge tourist attraction, was really nice to see. Lots of sellers by the side selling art, drinks, food, plenty of food stalls around the place. Plenty of restaurants to eat at. Bubba Gump restaurant was excellent. There is also a little carnival 🎡 rollercoaster was $10 p/p they let us ride it twice which was great because it was over quick enough! Nice to see, but wouldn’t run back in a hurry due to the fact it was so busy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ceallachain
30,Family vacation,We enjoyed our day at the Pier during the heat wave. Great way to beat the heat as it was 15 degrees cooler here than at our hotel near Universal. We spent the day on the beach and rented umbrellas and chairs in the pier (which made our day!). We had great burgers and ice cream for lunch as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/285dawnf
40,Great Adventure Day,We went during the week so hopefully less crowd. Get their early (we arrived about 1 pm) to park right on the pier. The cost was about $15 all day. The beach was great and the water warm. Fun to walk along the shoreline and under the pier. When the sun went down there are a few restaurants within walking distance. We grabbed a bite to eat and then afterward took a walk along the pier at night. The sights and sounds plus the all the people were great. If your looking for a day and night adventure this is one good place. The only bad part is the traffic. Have patience! Enjoy!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mavrick71
40,Great Spot - Always Busy,Spent some time here recently with my family. It is always busy no matter when you come. We arrived early in the evening and caught the sunset which is great from this location.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChargerNgo
50,Fun place to spend an afternoon,"We spent an afternoon here shopping, riding the rides, and enjoying the views. We were there on a Sunday in July so it was very, very crowded but it was still fun. Be sure to walk thru the park leading up to the pier for some amazing views!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuzyRW
40,"It's Great, If You Don't Expect TOO Much!","For what it is, the Pier is GREAT! It's a kitsch, crowded, touristy state fair surrounded on three sides by the ocean! Personally, I love it, but I know not to expect too much from it. The rides are fairly expensive unless you get a wristband and do a bunch of them, but I still jump on the Ferris Wheel every time, just because it is fun (especially with all the lights at night). The people-watching is great, the food is fun, and who doesn't like standing out at the edge of a pier and pretending you are Leonardo DiCapricio in Titanic: ""I am the King of the World!"" Read up a little on Historic Route 66, and it is a bit poignant to stand on the spot where it once started/ended. Plus the street musicians and performers give you plenty of live entertainment.You can rent scooters or bikes if you want to range farther down the beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gratefulz
50,Absolutely Beautiful,"What a perfect place to spend the day! We rented electric scooters to get around, inexpensive and worth every penny. Loved the views, the entertainment and people watching!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/396shellyc
50,A complete outing!,"I am a admirer of this beach and simply love this area of Los Angeles. There is so much positivity , hustle bustle around this place. The true spirit of California is seen here. The pier is very enjoyable for all age groups.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/namitajainisme
40,Good,Vibrant fun place to visit. Lots to see on the pier. Plenty of street performers (Magicians etc)Great views of the beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tom2626
40,Nice place!,"Nice place for friends and family, many games and attractions you can do for the weekend and the beach is there as well. The parking lot is big and you don’t have to walk that much to get to the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eugesada
50,Well worth a visit!,Loved it here! The beach was lovely and it was great to see muscle beach! The scenery is so accurate to the game ‘Grand Theft Auto V’!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisGower1975
50,Santa Monica pier,Nice place for kids and family! Enjoy the beach and the pacific park. Lots of little shops. Nice place to spend the day!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tammyp694
40,"Nice views of the beach, carnival feel","We walked to the pier from our hotel, which was just down the beach along the bike and walking path. The pier has all the typical carnival-type amenities, ice cream, funnel cakes, Bubba Gump Shrimp, rides, souvenirs and the famous ferris wheel. Fun stroll for a family of four (two teens). Worth a look-see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelbugMelB2015
30,Worth a Quick Trip - Better from Distance,"Hard to go to Santa Monica without at least walking through the Pier. It is a worthwhile walk-through but not worth more than a hour or so. Very cramped and, at times, bordering on seedy. However, not dissimilar to many amusement park-like attractions. The view of the pier and the Ferris wheel from a distance is spectacular. Closer-up, less so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/706rickk
50,Santa Monica Pier,"Wow! Wonderful LA Icon. Crowded to the hilt and kitchy as hell, but a true LA experience. I fondly remember a quieter boardwalk from my youth but those days are over. This pier is bustling with young families. Families dressed to impress along with families crusted and dripping wet sand as they cap off their day at the beach. Bubba Gump, Japadog, various small food vendors and the occassional churro and fresh fruit vendors hawking their goods to a buying crowd. Halfway down the pier you have iconic Pacific Park which is a small amusement park for the whole family. Follow the pier to the finale which is a Mexican Restaurant and a fishing area. The pier is a must see if you are a tourist or just an Angeleno poking around their beloved town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4Martinez
30,Not much to see,"Really wasn’t much to see, just a pier with a few rides, arcade and some stalls. Great photo opportunity though",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Taneecia

50,Excellent visit!!!,"Drove 2 hours from San Clemente to get there, the parking lot was almost full and the pier was packed with people going back and forth; plenty of shops and places to eat, the view is amazing and the feeling to see the waves smashing the pillars is awesome; the perfect place to visit if you are in California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hambch
40,Neat to see,We went just to walk the pier. The beach was really crowded. It was neat to see the view from the Pier. Ate at the Mexican restaurant at the end which was good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z7249OUshannonw
50,Always crowded but always fun,"I’ve been here a few times, most recently with a friend from out of town. It is always packed, but that’s part of the charm. It was hot as heck the day we went , so always being sunscreen and an umbrella if you are going in the heat of the day. I haven’t had a chance to go to any of the restaurants, but I did go on the carousel on a previous trip and it is fun. The street artists are always good fun. We walked all the way to the end of the pier this time, and it was oddly *not* crowded, and a street musician was playing some chill music in the background. It was nice. I do plan to come back to the amusement park in the future for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveleranon330
50,Boys family trip,"Great day overall. We were 5 boys on a family trip ages 70, 39, 17, 12 and 9. There was something for everyone. Beaches were nice with great waves for boogie boarding. Kids enjoyed the arcade and going for a bike ride along the beachside bike route. Did a leisurely bike ride to Venice beach and back followed by ice cream. I recommend getting to the beach around 10 or earlier if you want a good spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G4751IAvincentb
40,A Must do in Santa Monica,"Full of atmosphere and views of beach, this is an excellent spot to walk around and get into the holiday spirit. Whilst we didn't eat at any of the venues on the pier, we just soaked up the atmosphere and excitement of the fun fair.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fionnersg
20,Looks better in photos,We came here as we were staying close by in LA. and thought we should come out and visit. It was pretty average. Looks like an old fair ground on a pier....I couldn’t see why people would come here although the beach was lovely.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellabella1980
30,Nice ambience,"Not a great beach if you go by the hype, but good for a casual evening trip with friends and family. Too much crowded by the way. Parking is mess.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deecee1987
40,A Place to Visit...,"We are not a Disney Family, but we did like this place. It is the iconic end of Route 66. An America Landmark and a place if you are in LA that you have to visit to really enjoy the Beach Culture, epic views and people watching. If you have kids the will be totally into the amusement part, food and fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TampaTravelers1234

30,VERY crowded!,"I have been here on at least two separate occasions while visiting CA. The most recent time was insanely crowded. Maybe because it was during the peak of summer? It was way too crowded for my taste, but it's definitely on the ""must do"" list if you've never been before. I would say plan to come during a slower tourist season maybe.They have people selling water out of coolers for $1, which is nice if you didn't bring any water with you. Very hot and sunny in the summer so make sure to wear sunscreen and maybe a hat and sunnies! Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ree_EXO
50,Awesome Area!!,Santa Monica Pier is a must see location. Beautiful views and so many things to do. Highly recommend visiting the pier. Get there early as parking fills up fast!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Porterhub

50,Well maintained yet quaint,"There are plenty of amenities including a funfair on the pier. We found drinks, games and giftshops as well as karaoke, all with the magnificent beach backdrop. This adds to the range of attractions on offer at Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lottie03
50,LA Must,"I’ve visited LA many times. The iconic Santa Monica Pier is fun for all. Rides, shopping, restaurants, fishing, entertainment. It’s absolutely a great place to go for a day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/880BarbaraM
30,Interesting,Lots of people. Lots of street performers. Talented folks. Glad to say I’ve been there. It probly appeals to the younger crowd,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mwmvar
20,"Overrated, crowded and smells like alcohol and ...","Heard so much about this place. Went at night. Found it to be dirty, over-crowded, and highlighting the city's ever-growing and depressing homelessness crisis.This place is no different than a state fair with the addition of untalented street performers. Lots of unfortunate homeless folks around, some passed out on the beach. Very depressing. While these poor individuals suffer, the rest of us rack up credit card debt on useless paraphernalia (things that will end up in the dumpster or a garage sale) and food that neither tastes good, nor is it worth the price tag.LA, in general, is a disappointment. I visited here as a child a couple of decades ago and had so many fond memories. Now its a big dump that stinks of excrement and glorifies the unrealistic dreams of so many disillusioned individuals who come here with high hopes and end up passed out, homeless, on the beach.If you do decide to visit the pier, free 90 minute parking is available 8 min walk away in a large parking lot on Broadway and 2nd St.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DocMoMan
40,Lovely place,Such a lovely pier with lots to see and do it has street entertainers a few rides and some lovely handcrafted pieces for sale. Totally worth a visit if you are in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/siobhansmithis
50,"Fun, lively place","A really unique place to visit. Food, shopping, street entertainers, carnival/amusement rides. We did not eat during our visit so I cannot comment on the food but the ambience was great! We enjoyed a couple of songs from a band called Liliac. Once we were finished enjoying the pier we ventured into the surrounding downtown Santa Monica area. Lots to do & see! You will need to pay for parking but it’s not too pricey for a few hours of fun. Definitely worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Southerngypsydreams
20,Carnival mixed with chaos feel,"Second most visited besides Disneyland! Insane chaos. So many people. Typical tacky souvenir places and carnival typeAtmosphere. Worth seeing but if you miss it , not missing much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TorontoFanula
50,Great Place,"My advice? Go! What a great day we had. I think you should buy the unlimited ride tickets for the kids and then enjoy them enjoying themselves!Roller Coaster was a big hit along with the Dragon ride.Parked at the main lot for $15 all day. Close to the pier and the park.Ferris Wheel is awesome and it is powered by Solar. Pretty cool.You can enjoy the pier, go to the beach, have dinner at some nice places and not spend a fortune.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RIVERMAN63
30,Not impressed,Well we had to come and say we saw. Parking was very challenging and the crowd was large. There were street performers and vendors along the worn beaten wooden boardwalk. Being from Florida it is hard to compare the beaches anywhere else but this definitely is quintessential LA! If I had younger kids I am sure they would have loved the playland area on the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jazna5
40,Great spot even if it is a bit touristy,This is one of those touristy places that you have to visit while in Southern California. There is so much to do and see. It was a nice break on our vacation to spend the afternoon at the beach and on the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelleg436
40,Cool old pier,The scale of the pier is the first thing that strikes you as you wander down. There are lots of vendors and musicians along the length of it. There is an old school fair.It’s iconic but actually a worthwhile diversion.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gsutherl
40,"""Monica, Don't Leave Me"" Please! ""Santa Monica Stay With Me""","At the end of the day, the family and I, just did not want to leave the Pier. We had a wonderful time enjoying rides over and over again. Mingling with the talented music entertainers and photo paint artists. The pizzas was expensive and small, (one size for all), but good. When leaving, I thought of (The Fast and the Furious) (MONICA,,,,,,)!!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/828abrahamf
50,"Mornin g, afternoon, & evening","We started out day with trapeze lessons for our teenage daughters. An afternoon at the beach, and spent the evening riding rides and playing games. The pier made for a day of family fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ciffus
50,A Los Angeles classic pier by the ocean!,"If you go to LA you MUST go to the Santa Monica Pier! We learned the interesting history of the wooden wharf is the place to be, with its eateries, shops, high-tech arcade, roller coaster, giant Ferris wheel and other rides, famous 1922 indoor Looff Hippodrome Carousel which is a National Historic Landmark, and had fantastic views of the bay and the mountains. There is also a landmark sign that says you made it to the end of Historic Route 66. We didn't get to go in the evening but others say the sunset is beautiful from there as well as the Pier all lit up also. The views of the ocean and Santa Monica beach next to the pier are so worth the visit also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ebbark
50,Pretty,"I enjoyed the Santa Monica Pier, the view is stunning! You get amusement park, beach, and mountain views! It’s not far from the “Barbie House” (pink/purple beach house) and it’s within walking distance from Third Street Promenade’s shops and eateries.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelaz428
40,Bustling place to be,"We went there on a weekday evening and was quite amazed to see the crowd even in the middle of the week. It was a nice experience to see how folks were going about with their activities, be it a roller coaster ride, fishing on the pier, getting tan, enjoying a snack or even splashing some water....It was quite a difference from DTLA we were seeing for the whole week.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/satlakhapu
40,Best pier around.,"We enjoyed this pier the most on the west coast. We rented bikes from Venice beach and ride to Santa Monica. It’s an awesome ride, and the pier is great. Super views, great restaurants and attractions. It’s also the end (or start) of Route 66",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lloydmars10
40,Grand old Pier,"Supr busy during the summer break when we visited, ikon landmark foe the area on the large big beach and of course end of route 66.Lota of trinket type shops and booths, cafe, restaurants etc. And of course lots of people. I must do check out of this old girl and stand out landmark your can't miss.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robcX898NR
50,Kids love it!,We had promised the kids and our nephew and nieces to take them to the Santa Monica pier with its Pacific park amusement. They loved it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marko_van_der_Smitte

50,Wonderful Visit,"The pier is very active with families, beach-goers, musicians, and revelers. There is plenty to do and experience on the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveUFLoveFLA
50,So much fun!,Yes the pier is packed with people but it really is a fun time. All the shops and places to eat and performers on the pier were great. They do have public washrooms as well. It’s a fun thing to do during the day or in the evening. Great to walk around the whole area including checking out muscle beach! Rent a bike or a scooter and travel up and down the paths!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DubStub
20,Novthanks,"Too crowded, too many people with religious fervor and unofficial food vendors blocking the flow of people, the street performers were not impressive, rides looked sketchy. Probably worth walking to the end once, I am glad we did, but really unimpressive overall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoFryGo
30,Meh!,It was super crowded and not with great people. Beautiful sunset but I think you can have that sunset from much less crowded and cleaner places that are easier to get to and are less populated. We went to check it off our tourist list but could have better spent the time somewhere else.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S2336BDamandac
30,Don't know what all the fuss is about,"Average pier and beaches.... restaurant choices also not the greatest if you are planning on coming here to see it, it really is a non event",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlessioAllegrucci86
50,A must see,It's a perfect tourist trap and no trip to SoCal is complete without a visit. A perfect spot to have lunch and people watch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jihanp2018
40,A Fun Place to Spend some Time,"Ideal place to spend a couple hours on a sunny day or at night. There are some great opportunities for pictures here, along with good food, as well as cool places like Downtown Santa Monica and Venice Beach just within walking distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aneil4lom
40,Landmark,"Visiting this famous landmark is a must when in Santa Monica, it has a variety of funfair rides, stalls and eating spots we had a look round before descending the steps onto Santa Monica state beach were you can walk a few miles to Venice .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lpaganuk

50,Must visit,"Spent a few hours here and loved every minute. There is so much to see and do, especially with the little theme park, great spot for lunch and then some fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crystalmariep
40,Can’t Go Wrong at the Pier,"Whether you have $150 to spend for your family’s fun day or zero, you can all be enterained at the Pier. For free, you have the view, the beach, the ocean, the great people-watching, street performers, an acrobat school, & the joyous squeal of kids on the carrousel. For just a few bucks, you &/or your kids can ride the legendary old carrousel or y’all can check out the awesome Heal the Bay Aquarium under the carrousel, or enjoy a ride on the iconic Ferris Wheel. And for about the price of 1 adult admission to Disneyland, a family of four can get unlimited ride wristbands for Pacific Park Amusement Park at the Pier.Food options range from cheap-yet-overpriced amusement park junk food and lower-priced burger n’ beer-type joints to mid-range Mexican and seafood places all the way to high-end establishments like The Lobster. Plus some eateries adjacent to the Pier, including the first (I believe) Hot Dog on a Stick (it may not be the actual original stand but it is near the original stand’s location).Overall, with the usually wonderfully pleasant weather, it’s an affordable way to spend a fun afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SpencerP0721
40,Neat!,"Came to the famous Santa Monica Pier on a solo visit from Ontario Canada—first time to California. It’s a really neat place, very eclectic. The earlier you go the less people around which makes it easier to navigate. FYI like most tourist attractions things are over priced—forgot my sunscreen and it was $15. It was a neat experience and great photo opportunities there as well along the walkway prior. And 3rd Street Promenade is a very short walk, a place worth seeing too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NFMTravel
30,Okay place to visit,Santa Monica pier is kind of a must to visit when in LA. But it is crowded and there's really not that much to see. Okay shops and okay places to eat. Nothing more and nothing less.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/518gryf

40,Family day out,"Myself and my family visited Santa Monica Pier one evening. Well worth a visit if you are in the area. A lot of the locals doing their activities(singing, magic) on the pier.

30,Iconic but not my thing,"This is a classic site to see when in Santa Monica but it's really a carnival, yet a nice view from the pier",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/892TerryS
40,Once is enough,Extremely crowded. Can check this off the list of iconic places and feel I never have to go back again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dragonflystacy

40,Must see in LA,Going to the beach should be a must for everyone and going to Santa Monica Pier is a good option. The iconic boardwalk is a must see and yes there are lots of people but it is a part of the atmosphere. We went to see and to go swimming in the waves and ended the day by eating on the pier watching day becoming night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelEsmann
50,Beautiful day with great friends!,"Walked the pier and the beach, typical touristy shops but a great walk and fun people watching. I need to bring my fishing rod next time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/752karig
50,The End of the Road,"You can’t visit Santa Monica and not visit The Pier, would you go to Paris and avoid The Eiffel Tower? Or Rome and not see The Vatican? Well then you have to slip on some comfortable shoes and walk the planks. These planks that are a century old and have had thousands of happy visitors and locals alike spending time riding the rides, eating fun foods and even dancing the night away under the stars. Yes it’s a typical tourist trap with overpriced souvenirs, junk food, and peddlers of photos, knick- knacks and portraits, but how many folk can say they where at the end of the famed Route 66, even better have their photo taken with the historic sign. Santa Monica Pier is fun, iconic and a must if your lucky enough to make it to L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O9529OIlindam
40,Worth a visit,"This was a nice place to walk around and spend a few hours. The pier is nice, great views, the usual tourist stuff, good people watching, the beach is clean. Worth a visit one time while in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blackbear25
40,The End of Route 66. Muscle Beach. On the California must do once list. Beautiful Old carousel.,"Beach is clean, pier has overpriced souvenir shops, nice for a quick visit, but check out the old wooden 100+ year old Carousel inside the Hippodrome. I think what i like best about here was after having visited Chicago and finding the start of Route 66, and then driving some of it after camping in the Grand Canyon, to find an End of the trail sign for the end of route 66!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronchelleb
40,Nice place to spend with friends / family,"I liked the Santa Monica Pier. It is a good place to spend a few hours there with friends or family. We had ice cream there, which is always good! It also offers nice views of the beach and coastline, and a romantic place during sunsets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Holidaywhisperers
50,Nice view,Really nice view.That is all i got from here.For photographers - this is the best point for sunset.However hard to swim or whatever inside the ocean - interesting smell and massive bugs in the sand. Yaaak...😁😁😁,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evae960
50,Bright and buzzing,Plenty to see do and eat down this pier. The good/big rides are $10us the others range from $5-$8us. Perhaps stay away after 8pm with young kids as it gets quite “colourful” at night!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katpirpinias
30,Good place to visit once !,Nothing special rides are ok nice to say you have been but wouldn’t return as busy busy with nothing really to see,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulG2403
40,Old Fashioned Pier,"Spent an hour on the pier as part of the LA Tour, headed straight for the Mexican restaurant at the end with the yellow roof, to drink several margaritas. It was a hot day and for a Monday the beach was packed but still a pleasure to walk down the pier",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Laurel_265
20,The town is nicer than the pier,"We felt the town was much nicer than the pier area, it has nice shops and is kept well! It’s a refreshing break from Hollywood area!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robjames84
50,Still a nice place to take family and friends,There are a variety of activities to keep everyone happy. The place has been around for awhile but it has been well maintained. You can enjoy the scenery and people watch for free or blow your whole paycheck. It's up to you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HarperVoyages
30,Evening stroll,"Walked about 1/2mile along promenade to pier. $14 dollars parking. Promenade is run down and dilapidated. Closer parking is available. Busy with visitors but generally happy, relaxed atmosphere. Funfair with stalls and rides. A little expensive in my view but seemed popular but no long queues. Fast food stalls and drinks. Buskers and portrait artists.Nice view from pier.Sandy beach. 200y to sea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/apb180868
30,Fun Stop,"Didn't ride the rides, some looked a little sketchy. Walked the pier. The arcade was our highlight. Classic games, plus new. Skee-ball, coin games, etc. Great views. Great beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anilizzy
40,Must see when in the area,"This attraction is very popular with tourists and locals.

40,First time,Cool place lots of stuff to do you know it's a tourist trap but who cares you go for the experience . The environment feels more friendly than Coney Island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RGomez1989
30,Very touristy,Nice boardwalk and good for families but it’s very touristy and you’ll need to deal with the crowds. If you are looking for a Californian Beach experience head to Malibu.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haze73
50,Fun day trip from LA,"Had a fun day in Santa Monica while visiting LA. We strolled the pier, then rented bikes and rode them to Venice beach. Very easy, short ride along the boardwalk. Great day! Highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kelly32963
40,Great in the off season!,"As a local, we frequent the pier. Our son loves the arcade, the amusement park and we make it a fun family night. I definitely recommend a visit, but only if you are visiting in the off-season (NOT THE SUMMER). We recently went in July and were so disappointed. Not only had our favorite little Italian restaurant been replaced by a seaside cafe, but it was super crowded and filled with several homeless. Granted it was a record-breaking hot day, but not what we expected. Avoid it in the summer months, but otherwise a very fun place to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maxxw2013
50,"Nice pier, something to do for everyone","We enjoyed the pier, rides were fun, a little pricy. Cost $20 for 2 of us to ride the Ferris wheel. Went on a Wednesday, and it was packed. Little scooters all over to ride, that was fun as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/464amandao
50,Great place - must visit!,This place is a must if you're around LA. The ocean breeze is fantastic and relaxing. Also a great place for photos. You can buy some souvenirs and have lunch there as well. Beatiful!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/735tiagos
30,Interesting people watching place,"This is worth a stop just for watching the people, vendors, street performers, etc. Parking can be a bit difficult though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ERL972
40,Fun destitation and a must see,"The pier was one of those must see places. It is a iconic location often seen in tv shows and movies. It is a very happening place with much to do whether it is the rides, the restaurants or the museums. A lot of fun and awesome sunsets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertbS9031GQ
40,Crowded but fun,"Went on July 4, so probably more crowded than usual. There are a few rides, but very expensive, so took a pass on them. Lots of food vendors and carnival games. Not a peaceful, relaxing place. Big beach area all around.Still fun to walk around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andy4AZ
40,Instagramable,We went to the Santa Monica Pier just to have fun and hang out for a bit but it turned out to be a great insta pic spot. Totally didn't expect such great pictures (also due to the perfect weather).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/uniashkie
40,Back to see the changes in last two years,"It’s two years ago since we were last here and a few things had changed but much the same.As we drove down from Getty Center we had to get parking, we use large public parking area to the right of pier. This is an all day price which was $15 and there seemed to be plenty parking. There is parking on the pier it’s self and I think this is on an hourly rate not sure of the price.There are plenty of places to eat from very cheap to mid range pricing.The thing you will not see on the pier are Sea Gulls, plenty of Pidgins but no gulls.Great place for kids or adults.Again an other must visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blc45reb
50,Cool & worth repeat visit,"It’s worth visiting, during our first visit to LA we planned an afternoon trip in the month of July. It was bright sunny day but it was chilly.There is ample parking space, work repeat visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NavinPuri
50,Lots to do,"We love going toThe Santa Monica Pier and watching the people go by and just watching the ocean. Such a great place to visit, people watch and grab a bite to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IndySig
30,Pop by have a wallk around,Since you're here might as well pop by . famous spot for a wallk . bit overcrouded if you ask me . too many people trying to sell you junk . bit of a rip off prices . just go for wallk ignore all else,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danny10002
40,Must See If Your Visiting,"Its a fun place, very popular, great views and some nice restaurants, plenty of places to buy a t-shirt and the rides are fun. Its crazy busy on the weekends, we were there on a Sunday and a Monday, Sunday was Fathers Day and it was a zoo but Monday was pleasure. We walked from the pier to Venice beach and back. Its a fantastic walk with lots of shops, cafes, places to eat, muscle beach. Do yourself a favor and visit on a week day if you can.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pokershark
40,Crowdy and cool,"A rwally cool place and a must see. But we went there in the weekend and it was very crowdy. A lot of fun to see,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Haggis170
30,Too crowded on a weekend!,"The iconic Santa Monica Pier is lovely to visit before the crowds arrive. If you prefer to stay away from the crowds, go north along the beach towards Palisades Park. We did some biking there which was awesome!Frankly, I prefer exploring the shops along 3rd Promenade which is just a stone’s throw away from the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YChan2016
50,Quaint carousel,"The pier carousel is a must visit, so quaint and antique with an old style soda stall next to it. The general pier itself is lovely with some fairground rides and stalls a coffee shop, food stalls, burger bar and a couple of souvenir shops",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauz012001
40,Pretty much as expected from movies,The pier is buzzing with activity and my kids enjoyed the rides as the roller coaster and wheel offered great views over the beach and pier. The beach close to the pier is not the cleanest so better to go further down to the Pailsades area. Food vendors pricey and very average.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Culinarykids
50,Santa Monica beach,"Bay watch beach big but not clean beach , urchins and homeless people thron the area , we were warned by our tour guide to stay in group since these people try to snatch from tourist their bags. Water on the floor and beach was not clear and clean...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kazish55
50,Fun for kids,Kids really enjoy going here and experiencing all the rides. Its best to go when it's not crowded like it is on the weekends in the summer. Great location near Third Street Pronenade and the Tree Beach which has fantastic views. The pier is a great experience atleast once.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UdiyaR
30,Nice place for a walk a to watch people,Nice place for a walk. We did not visit the shops nor the restaurant as they look pretty touristic. Interesting people and artists to watch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dremaster2016

40,Real Pier Experience,"My husband and I visited our son’s family last weekend. Our 18 year-old accompanied us and our son has a 4 year-old. There were plenty of exciting things to see, hear, and eat. A lovely breeze refreshed us from the unusually hot weekend, rare for Santa Monica, we’re told. Overall, it was a wonderful time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evaw822
40,Great Views,"You get some absolutely beautiful views from the pier and have easy access down to the beach. There is a mini amusement park with rides to keep kids and adults entertained. Please of food options, but not the healthiest choices. The games in the amusement park area are so expensive it's offensive, so beware.All in all, it can be a part of a pretty fun family day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G4524ZIjd
50,Can’t Miss Views & End of the Famous Rt 66,We love coming to the pier and bring all our family & friends here. There is a marker/sign for the end of Route 66. Check calendar in the summer for concerts on the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/calgal405
30,Crazy busy of a daytime,"the pier is probably best to visit late afternoon-evening time. It was extremely busy when we visited sunday mid-day, so we couldn't really enjoy the pier fully",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V142RZsaraha
30,Nice but very crowded,I was very excited to go to this iconic pier but was kinda let down. It was very crowded and we had to pay $14 to park in the lot near the pier. The carnival on the pier is jammed together and $6-10 per ride. The food places had long waits and pricy snacks. Overall it was just ok...but I saw it. Wouldn’t go out of my way again to see it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunshine816
50,One of the nicest beach areas in LA,"You won't be dissapointed by visiting this place, there are so many things to do there, a lot of activities and sightseeings...and it's famous because it marks the ending point of route 66. Also the beach area is amazing, the sand is soft, pleasentful...If you are looking for a place to chill, this is it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/szabotony93
30,"View of Ocean & Beach, End of Route 66 sign. Otherwise kind of overrated!","Visited with other young adults and no kids.

40,Always Buzzing night or day,"I visited the Santa Monica pier after swimming at the world famous Baywatch beach so we were looking for some warm food and drinks after the swimming. We had no problem finding both of these and a whole lot else at the Santa Monica Pier. The place is always buzzing with activity you have to wonder howcome nobody seems to have to work at this place. Anyhow we spend some time trying a few rides which my 8 year old enjoyed tremendously and we walked the length of the pier enjoying all that it has to offer. There was also a private party being held at the pier which added to the vibey feel of the place! Look not everything is beautiful and there is a seedier side to the place that you should look out for and be aware off, but on teh whole it is still a family friendly place to visit imho.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thanesh2016
50,Great at sunset,Ransom of success it's overcrowded parking is quite difficult but at sunset it's a great place to walk around it worth the effortUnfortunately like almost every where in US it's loaded with disgusting fast food,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pierrec577
40,REQUIRED VISIT FOR ANY TOURIST,"You won't get out of there without stopping here. Its well worth it, and a big hit with kids. From here you can walk over to Muscle beach area to take a quick look, and hang on the beach probably on Santa Monica side if you like. The pier was once called POP before a fire burned it all down and it was rebuilt in better quality.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Inca1533
30,Tourist trap,"We were tourists, expecting a tourist trap, and this place was too much even with that mindset. People were everywhere, so crowded. We did it just to say we did it, but got out of there pretty quickly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raychampagne
40,Old fashioned sense of fun. Worth a walk,It’s still like the set of a 1960s movie a little faded but still a great walk out to the sea. Great views. Better off dining back on the main strip better food available at lower prices!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisonwY9974AZ
40,Business Trip,It was neat to see. Not a whole lot to do. The view was a bit hazy but pretty. I'm sure it may be busier at other times of the year.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adventuremomm
30,Busy pier,"There was a lot to do here, and since it was so crowded it's hard to get in to do anything. The view of the ocean is beautiful, so that in and of itself is worth the visit. The pier is crowded but is full of restaurants, stalls selling souvenirs and snacks as well as activities. It would be a fun family outing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisiyag2017

50,Santa Monica Pier,"Located at the west end of Route 66. Wanted to see at least once. It’s busy, crowded, plenty to see and do. Has an amusement park at end, at night it is lit up and looks cool. Several food options available. It was nice to see, only spent a few hours out there, probably don’t need to go back for awhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Connector561395
30,Nice beach and fun activities,The pier at santa monica is full of activities and amusement park rides plus good restaurants. The beach is nice and cold.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tarun2k5
10,Big disappointment,I don’t know if this place was crowded because it was July or super that day but what a let down. Just gross and stinky. Traffic is awful. It reeked of urine. A lot of homeless people and drug addicts. I saw addicts vomiting in public. Nothing against homeless people because hard times can happen to anyone but it’s just sad to see a tourist attraction riddled with junkies.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/starlenaw
40,A must for movie lovers,"Just like from movies. Vibrant, crowded, colorful gem on the Santa Monica Beach. Plan your time wisely as traveling there might be a pain in the a...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joonas2014
50,Iconic,"Looked forward to this most of all on our west coast trip. Enjoyed the walk down the boardwalk and managed to catch a picture perfect sunset that evening.Things I didn’t like, watched a guy catch a shark and then kill it there on the pier. Once again the parking in So-Cal takes forever and the crowds hamper the entry and exit from the pier. Thought about the Ferris wheel ride but it was so over priced that I decided against it.I would suggest going there late enough in the day that you can catch the sunset. It really is one of the great places to do that.Probably my most favorite memory of our west coast trip so far.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeMc33
40,How could you not visit if in LA?,"An iconic place to visit and made the trip on Independence Day eve and despite the large crowd, it was well worth it. Take in the vista, enjoy the roller coaster, have an ice cream and take a photo and tick it off the list. There’s also lots of good places to eat on the pier and nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ken-230910
50,"Fantastic atmosphere, great buskers and lovely breeze off the water","Lively place to visit, buskers were amazing, lots of people but it didn’t seem overly crowded. Man fishing off the end of the pier and a great walk after travelling. Had lunch at Bubba Gump Shrimp which was fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julieo664
50,Ever Refreshing Pier,"My family’s been to this pier several times before but each time is still so refreshingly entertaining! We love the many variety of baskers, the food esp fennel cake, the relaxing walk and just the atmosphere is fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripreview777
50,Fun,"We have all seen the pics of this California pier, a must see, although very touristy, recommend hiring bikes to cycle to Venice Beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hilary005
40,Always enjoyable,"We always enjoy our trip to the pier. The rides and games are cute, and it’s a fun evening or daytime activity for the family. Definitely a must-do while in Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kandrews74
40,Hangout and relax,We spent the day biking along the path which was fun as expected however beware of small children and pedestrians wondering onto the bike lanes during busy periods.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MK5402
50,Iconic,"It’s where Ryan Gosling walked along in La La Land and had a waltz with a lady before her husband gave him daggers.It was larger than I expected, a fairground on it at the beginning with a Ferris wheel.Great atmosphere and people fishing, selling donuts, candy floss, drinks, etc.A must visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnTripAdviser
40,Kids enjoy a couple of hours of fun,Nothing special but nice if you are with kidsand plan time on Beach and Venice anyway. Parking available closeby.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenGlesener
40,Nice ambience to enjoy sunset,"We enjoyed sunset and liked the ambience during summer time.. There are lot of food vendors, snacks and a many games for kids around the ferris wheel.. there are also plenty of souvenir shops around .. We stayed until dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arsu_12
40,"Santa Monica Pier... great ocean views, good food and amazing amateur performances!","I have been to this pier, several times before in the past. But this trip was fun, because I had more time to spend at it, by myself. The Russian girl with the violin was wonderful, the man who played guitar, wearing a full headed Don Trump mask... That was my favorite... So funny... especially singing in Spanish. The only part that disappointed me was that I bought a chili cheese dog, but the vending booth did notbother supplying plastic utensils!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y2659QRdarreng
40,Fun and a must visit (2hrs is good),Fun. Quintessential pier setting w hotdogs and pizza and musicians and street acts and little rides. Fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maelkimo
40,A happening place,It was more kids but it was still fun to walk around and people watch and great views of the shoreline when your way out on the pier,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twin411
50,Must do!,Went there today and it’s just beautiful! Crowds were in full force due to holiday but still manageable. It’s pricey to park- $14 and rides can be up to $10 a piece. Wrist bands were I believe $30. But the history of this pier and the views make it worth the stop. Beware of traffic getting here- 1 mile took 1 hour for us. Food on pier is plentiful but pricey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/412christier
50,Great place to hang out,"Loved Santa Monica! It’s beautiful, clean and lively. Next time we come to LA we will definitely stay here. The pier is retro fun, the beach is beautiful and the bike path is great. Awesome time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolynl393
50,Amazing,"The views and attractions, great combo for a sunny morning!The rollercoaster is ok but not really trhilling. Anyway, it is super worth it and it’s a must see in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oliveira_de_figueira
50,Great atmosphere,Were advised to give this place a miss on weekends as it’s too crowded. Glad we listened. We went on a Monday and whilst busy - not unpleasant. The pier is a nice stroll out with views of water.The stalls selling souvenirs on the pier are far more expensive than the ones down tvs main strip at Venice beach. My daughter bought the same jumper she looked at on the pier for half the price down the strip at Venice beach.The amusement park has a great atmosphere but if you want ‘scary’ rides you won’t find them there. But a great thing to experience.Hired bikes from down on the bike path (Shutters) and then rode to Venice beach and back. The electric scooters for hire are very cheap but we didn’t have time to give them a go but they appeared very popular,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissKirstsTravels
50,A fleeting visit - not long enough,"This place bubbles with activity. It’s full of vibe, and freshness, and enveloped by warm Pacific Ocean breezes! A def must for those visiting California!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zorbacfp
40,Pier Amusements and great view of the coastline,Santa Monica had a great array of restaurants - pier has an amusement park and loads of souvenir sellers and artistic performers.There is also an historic merry go round that is working and worth a look.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/campbellw300
30,Iconic,"I grow up seeing this place in many films, now I Finally got the. Chance to come here myself, a truly iconic landmark with beautiful Scenery. You ain’t seen California and till you come here, good vibes nice people family amusement park what more can you ask for, beach on both side shops in the middle Venice beach 15 mins walk away. Also Opposite the pier is a outside Chess club and outside gym love this place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/82lloydm
50,The end of the road!,"We visited here at the end of our epic Route 66 road trip. We got here early so it was reasonably quiet - that meant we able to get a parking spot on the pier itself.As an end point (albeit not 100% the true original end point!) of a 2,400 mile journey on the mother road, this place seems just perfect.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DorMart
40,Sunday at Sta Monica Pier,"I had a layover flight of 9 hrs, so I decided to visit Santa Monica (one of my pending stops in LA). From the LAX airport is a free shuttle that dropp you off next to the bus station of the Santa Monica bus (the tkt is $1.50 one way -- take cash and singles, the machine do not give change). The trip by bus is around 40 min.I enjoyed a nice sunday, sunny , people on the beach, was really cool! Good for a nice walked , have lunch and enjoy an ice cream.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/slstraveller
50,Santa Monica Pier,We only had about an hour due to being on a bus tour. The place is busy but well worth the effort to go there. There a number of eateries and of course there are the rides. It’s a must do when visiting LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColScott
50,Iconic place. Well worth a visit,"Visited with family. Nice place known from movies and an important part of LA for all. Easy to recognize and easy to like. Diffirent small businesses and local artists colored the day without impressing to much. Parked at Venice beach and walked to the pier. Approximately 2 kms. Pavement for walking only, separated bike lines. You can even park at the pier. Plenty of parking space on weekdays. Close by the pier if the pier is full. The parking is affordable (9-18$ pr day)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/386gustavl
40,World famous pier / homeless haven,This pier is amazing eclectic. The musical pier entertainment always impresses me. LAviolin artist left us in awe. The rides are a little better than a roaming carnival but $10 each for the bigger ones. For some reason there were more than I could imagine homeless type people that weren’t physically aggressive but when you come in their vicinity their stench was more than words could describe and quite an impression one would not want for this establishment. The Dippin’ Dots and funnel cake hit the spot and left us happy despite all else. Enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dkboyer2000
30,Crowded but worth a visit,We were here in December 2017 and January 2018. On our second visit the crowds were ridiculous! Very touristy but if you're staying nearby it's worth going for a look as it's such an iconic spot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davewilloPerth
30,Dirty & Expensive,"Perhaps it’s because we had just visited Destin Fl but we were all surprised at how dirty the beach was- my son described it as looking like mud. We had a unique expedience but wouldn’t go back. The prices for rides was crazy, $5 per ride. The beach was crowded and dirty. We were surprised at the number of people trying to sell mangos, toys and other items on the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristyE862
50,Must see and enjoy!!!,"A bit overcrowded on weekends, but is an attraction in itself. Cheerful atmosphere, any kind of performers, nice places to eat, it's all amazing!!!! Don't miss it!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/medoc23
40,Family Adventure,Family of four (two 16 yr old boys) visited the pier as part of a tour. It was fun / interesting seeing all the odd folk on the pier. An hour is enough but would have tried the seafood restaurant if we hadn’t been on such a tight timeline.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DennisKilian
50,A perfect attraction,My favourite part of visiting Los Angeles was going to Santa Monica Pier. It is a lovely (and clean) beach and it is a much nicer experience than Venice Beach. There is a great midway with lots of cute shops and restaurants. Lots of families are around so it feels very safe. The view is very nice and it is the perfect place to relax. There is cheap parking nearby at the mall and there are a ton of great stores for the whole family. I could spend an entire day here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jabri
40,lots to see and do,"I was here on a Friday night so it was pretty crowded, but saw a nice sunset and lots of entertainers. Several places to eat and lots of people watching and nice views of the ocean and the shoreline",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Misterjag
50,The Western Terminus Of The Famous Route 66,I like the Santa Monica Pier even though it's crowded. There is a good deal of shops and activities. Little hard to get on to the pier from the parking lot. It's crazy to think this is where Route 66 ended. It's also not far from the western end of I-10. Definitely a good place to visit and see the Pacific Ocean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CalebJ896
40,Has to be done - but maybe just once/twice!,"This pier is iconic but until I got there I had no idea it was the 'finish line' for Route 66!In common with many US piers, you can drive onto it and park and on the day we visited, there were a number of people photographing their cars having completed their Route.Personally, the fun-fair/kiss-me-quick/tacky souvenir shop element doesn't appeal - although I did go up on the Ferris wheel for the view. Walking right to the end, you get a fabulous view of the beaches and coastline and there was a guy at the very end playing a saxophone - fabulous sounds on a hot sunny day.Part way down there was a kart giving you the opportunity to choose from a huge range of fruit to make your own (huge) fresh fruit pot, which was lovely.In the evening, go down to the beach to get that iconic photo of the sunset behind the pier.It all 'has' to be done but it's not somewhere I would want to visit time and time again - been there, done that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cm9cm9
40,Fun,The Santa Monica Pier is a fun thing to do. It can get very buy here. Great to people watching. Lots of street artists.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/931wendyv
40,Bustling but a must see.,"We visited on a Sunday afternoon. The weather was fantastic so the pier and beach area was especially crowded. We found parking in a garage a few blocks away and walked down to the pier. My two teenage boys weren’t interested in riding the amusements as we had been to Magic Mountain the day before. You can walk the entire length of the pier at no cost. There are vendors, performers, and some restaurants along the route. Very scenic and tourists should enjoy the sights. Glad we visited the landmark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenlC2607FN
30,Not up to the hype,"It is a pier, with a very small number of amusement and tourist aimed shops and food stalls.It was good to visit the famed carousel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barry_Mc65
30,No place for teen agers,This is must visit for families with small kids. My teenagers were just interested in the electric scootys called Bird and Line(must do). Lot of activities for small kids and awesome food and gaming arcades. Be ready to spend as everything is expensive. You must swim at Venice Beach in case you really want to as the water is not too warm.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SumitBanga
30,Lots of people.,Schools out so it was super busy on a Sunday night. We enjoyed it the people watching.I don’t think we need to go back. Good exercise going up the ramps.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Buddyholly1007
40,Vibrant,Go here on a weekend it’s crazy it’s fun it’s absolutely humming. Great to people watching and have a fun evening,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelr583
30,Pretty View - Quick Visit,"When in Santa Monica, one feels that it is a requirement to check out the view from the Pier. It is in so many movies and tv shows, we just felt the need to do it! Our Lyft driver dropped us off on the boardwalk. Note that there is a hill down from the famous sign to the pier itself. If you walk down, remember that you have to walk back up! Not terrible, but something I wish I had known!There is access to the beach from both sides of the pier. As you walk down the pier to the end, there are a bunch of street performers, artists (all independent but seem to miraculously be selling the same things), along with restaurants, arcade games, and amusement rides. Cool view from the end. Had to sneak in between folks who were taking selfies and those who were fishing!We were there in the late afternoon before dinner time. It was quite busy. Glad we went to say we went, but I don't know if I have the desire to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R3144LElaurenh
50,Must visit!,"If you’re willing to spot any celebrities, this is a must for you, this is one of the most famous attractions in Santa Monica! It’s close to Third Street Promenade which is a very nice shopping street! And the rides here are fun and they are not very crowded. After all rides there are many restaurants like Bubba Gump or Pier Burgers. Family recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valea521
40,"Fun ""classic"" sea side",Nice place to stroll down and look out over the beach and ocean. Lots of shops selling gidts/t shirts. Few street performers. Also the Pacific Park rides and arcade. Didn't go on any but they looked quite traditional but brightly coloured.Worth dropping in on if you're in the area/at the beach for the day but not necessarily worth a trip across the city for,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GBarney2015
40,Fun in the Sun,"The main attraction is the rollercoaster, and while it is incredibly tame, it does provide some spectacular views of the beaches either side of the pier. There are a variety of small rides for children, and loads of carnival games.At night , the big wheel lights up, and looks spectacular, as does the rest of the boardwalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrumpyReviewsUK
50,Iconic place to visit,"If you ever visit Los Angeles, CA. You cannot miss to visit the Santa Monica Pier. Very nice and peaceful place. I used the visit to meditate meanwhile I admired the sunset.Highly recommended",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lmosquera22
30,Went for a walk,"We when early in the morning and was not very busy, which was great. But by late morning started to get very busy, crowded and found ourselves moving out of the often.When not busy very nice walk, could with being cleaned more regularly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shoque31
20,"Over priced, dirty and full of forceful sales people","I took a quick visit to Santa Monica Pier with my wife, 10 yr old son and 7 yr old daughter while visiting L.A.The first issue was with local parking. We pulled into a parking lot at 2pm to be met by the attendant. $35 for the day I'm told. Um, no I don't think so. So we drove to 2 st to parking structure 6. Parking Structure 61431 2nd St, Santa Monica, CA 90401, USA3 hrs for $3.10. Normal rates for a multi storey parking lot. Don't pay the rip off rates, use the city parking.The pier it's self was dirty, and very over priced. $10 per person for a ride on the ferris wheel and $15 per person for the small roller coaster.Beware of the food sellers who are vert pushy. Not a great experience, and one not to be repeated anytime soon",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adavies1974
40,Fun!,"This was an interesting and fun place to walk through! You can park and go in, or you can walk across the bridge to get here. There are lots of rides available and lots of food that you can get as well. Many people do performing in this area, such as singing and other music. Go and enjoy yourself!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/279ericai
40,12 views of the pier,The pier has a different vibe during off-hours.Give yourself a chance to check out both sunrise and sunsets,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lapster2011
10,Overpopulated and dirty,"No thanks. The two above words is all I would be to know I’m am not interested in returning. They also let preachers yell about Jesus through microphones and others handing out religious pamphlets. It was annoying, overcrowded, the beach is super dirty and gross. It’s a nope for me and my family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaneA424
30,Family Fun at the end of Old Route 66,"We had a nice evening at the Pier, but we went the night before a local parade was scheduled, and the crowds were off-putting. A second visit there later in the week to pick up a souvenir was quieter. The amusement area is relatively small, but looked like it would be fun for families with younger children. Other than that, it's what you would expect from an amusement pier. It's an historical landmark, marking the very end of Old Route 66, which I found interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SeanFodera
40,"Worth it for a stroll, park in the garages two blocks east","Our family visited there twice in two days, and each time was different. There are various street performers touting their magic, music, or art. We dined at a deli which was overpriced, but the Mexican restaurant at the end of the pier was our choice the next day and delicious! The Marisol also employs a professional photographer who takes pics of your party. My father purchased a picture for us, not sure how much they cost. Don't waste your money on the midway, although I have been on the ferris wheel in years past and enjoyed the views. We just told our boys that we'd be going to Universal Studios so the little Pacific Park amusement center would be underwhelming. The boardwalk/beach area was very crowded on the Friday afternoon, you have to watch out for all the Lime/Bird scooter riders and the pedestrians, as well as bicyclists. Also beware the numerous homeless people sleeping under the trees on the beach near the bathrooms.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whitney629
40,Worth a visit,"A fun little spot to spend a couple of hours. Rides on the boardwalk are expensive. $10 for 2 - 30 second rides on the rollercoaster. As a first time visitor to the area, glad we spent a little bit of time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nabrunson
50,Just knowing it's considered the best was exiting.,"I could see why it's famous,I guess on the West Coast anyway,has coolarray of restaurants at beginning and a Bubba Gumps,plus some tshirt and gift vendors before entrance.Fair prices for ride tickets,ice cream,etc.considering the name of this pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmid7777
50,Nostalgic,We had a great day here. Weather was great. People we encountered were friendly. A must see when in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lclunie
50,Stunning beach,Beautiful beach and pier !! Would highly recommend hiring electric scooters to travel along the beach front - if you download the app ‘bird’ you can pick them up by using the map as it shows their locations and charge - scan the barcode and you’re good to use as much as you want ! Really well priced and great way to travel !!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/146philippaf
20,So gross,Everything is filthy and it’s so crowded. All the time. Homeless people everywhere. I wouldnt eat at any restaurants on the pier. I wouldn’t go on any of the rides- I’d head over to disney or universal for rides. The water looks pretty but the beach right next to the pier is packed. Need less people and cleaner stores and restaurants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F3270BPnicolek
50,"Beautiful scenery, worth the drive",Definitely a beautiful view! You can also shop at stores nearby and eat on the pier at a variety of restaurants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cvlemus28
50,Pier Pressure of the Best KInd,"Good old fashioned fair atmosphere. Rides, games and food. All the parts of a fair permanently at the Santa Monica pier. I like to visit Bubba Gump. Great place to relax or have lots of fun. Go on the rides or go all the way to the end and just relax. HIghly recommend on a trip to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexandreesteban
50,Really fun place to go!,"We went there because it was the end of Rt 66- which we had been traveling down- and had a sign showing ""Route 66: The End of the Trail."" There were lots of rides, eateries, musicians and things on the pier, plus it's just fun to watch the beach from the pier. It's a great place to go. And would recommend Bubba Gumps Shrimp House on the pier as a great place to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abqsage
30,Wow! The crowds!,Everyone told us we had to go to Santa Monica Pier so we headed out early to experience the pier and beachfront It was way too crowded for our taste and we hurried back to “our beach” Venus! Less people same beautiful sand and air! But don’t get me wrong the Santa Monica Pier and shops were very nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/526donnab526
20,Old Coney Island style,"Nothing so special, this place seems like Coney Island in New York area everything is focused on tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alle_Ferla

50,Fun,"Family friendly a little tack, carnival games and crowd. We had fun. It can get a little cool at night. Felt very safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1Racer
50,Scooby doo pa pa,"We spent the day here with our kids. Surfed, rode bikes and hung out on the pier with our dog. Weather was good and not to crowded. One of the street performers was playing that song and dancing (if you've seen him he's hard to forget)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wanterer44
20,Freak show,"Sorry but there are better places to spend your time. I did not enjoy the chaos of Santa Monica pier at all. This was my second visit and I only went reluctantly because friends I was traveling with had never seen it. Now they can say been there, done that and they have no desire to go back either. Also... hold on to your wallet!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeachyKeen68
50,Love Santa Monica Pier,The pier has lots of paid and free activities giving you lot's of choice in how you experience the pier. The crowds can become quite large during peak seasons but don't let that turn you away.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LandPlaceSea
50,Never gets okd,I personally love the vibe and atmosphere of the pier in SM. I have tons of friends that live in the area and we never get tired of the gorgeous sunset on the beach or the cool people working out off to the side.There are tons of things to do and you can spend an entire day just venturing around from store to store.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NaomiAyalew
40,Fun times,"This is a place for the family. There are rides, good food, entertainment, bikes, and scooters. I would recommend this beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/190inezj
50,Lots to do!,"Loved Santa Monica Pier, old school fun and lots of entertainment for the whole family. The beach is beautiful, fine soft sand and close to amenities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suseowen
50,Fun,We had a blast at Santa Monica pier and beach we went on the rides ate funnel cake and pizza. They had lots of things to do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shandav00990
20,Not my cup of tea,"I'm a central coast beach girl so I was not a fan of this LA beach. A day at the beach should be fun and relaxing, however the amount of vendors constantly bugging me was very annoying. Repeatedly coming by shouting and hawking was incredibly obnoxious. The most fun part was the arcade with some old school classics like air hockey. Parking lot fills up and a bus blocked the exit. It's $15 to park. At least I can say I saw it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandar6152018
50,First sight!,A thrill to be so close to the Pacific! Great music and a seal came to to pier! Relaxing and beautiful!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MBGoGo
30,Just to hang around a couple of hours,"Its not a big deal. Really its just a boardwalk with a few restaurants and a couple of souvenir shops. If the day is nice, is worth to walk around and see the seals in the ocean playing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luisitorey
50,Love this place,Love this place! It gives a nice view to the ocean. You can sit at the end of the pier and enjoy the view. It also offer plenty of restaurants where you can eat fresh seafood. It’s fun for all ages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/n_scarlatescu
40,Worth it,On our trip to California we visited the Santa Monica pier twice. Both right about sunset awesome. The only negative is the parking. But it is a must do if your in Southern California.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/449mathewb
40,Nice stop,"We stopped at the Santa Monica Pier to take photos mid morning on a Sunday. We found a parking place on the street not too far away, but wish we would have known that there is parking directly on the beach by the pier (you could not see it from the street). The Pier seemed hard do walk on because the planks were not even/flat so bring good footwear. A few nice little shops and rides. Great photo opportunity with the rides and end of route 66 sign, too. Overall a nice stop and liked that it wasn't so busy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CraigSabine
40,Just to have been there,"When you are one time in Santa Monica, you should also visit the Pier. At the end you have a view over the ocean and during night time you have interesting light effects. The place is very touristic. A lot of expenisve Souvenier shops and food places (Restaurants and Fast Food). You also can visit the park of joy. Worth to see is also the End of Route 66 sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/romanshorner
40,Nice little tour,"This was a nice little tour. Not a place that you could spend the whole day, but, easy a couple hours. After touring the pier, we went down and spent some time on the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikej284
30,A standard fair ground...,"We visited thinking we might see something a little different at this famous fair, unfortunately it is the same old carnival games, junk food and questionably safe looking rides as every other seaside fair we've seen in Britain. Everything was very overpriced and after a short walk to the end of the pier we left.It was fun to see the unusual light display on the Ferris wheel at night but overall not our scene.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurajtravels88
30,A Cheesy Amusement Park at the Pier,"Standard ride attractions here, ferris wheel roller coaster, etc. Other rides you would expect to find at a traveling amusement park, the pop up kind you see in your neighborhood for a few days.The surrounding area is populated with tourists and lots of homeless people and druggies. Park near the Promenade, walk to the pier and take pictures for free. I wouldn't recommend coming here for tourists, there are better piers to visit without the traffic and homeless. I recommend Hermosa Beach Pier and Malibu Pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleysK4355MG
30,Not my kind of place,Parking was $14 if you park in the lot right next to the pier. We also go there a little early so the rides weren't going and the aquarium didn't open until 2pm. That might be skewing my review a little and it didn't help that it was a very cold and cloudy day. The beach was nice to play on but otherwise there was just a lot of touristy shops and kiosks to shop at. Not much for us to do with a 2 year old.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheljowo
40,Always nice!,The new thing you will see is that there are electric scooters everywhere. You can rent them by using your phone. I tried with an Ipad and it didn't work. You must have a driver's license and a credit card to open an account. The beauty is that when you are done with it you just leave it where you are. You don't have to return it to a special location. I rented a bike from Sea Mist rentals. Everything went smoothly. You must pay cash. Rode all along the board walk. Best to go early to avoid the crowds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JsHappytravels
50,Crowded,It was everything you expected it to be. Super crowded but fun. Reminded me of John Belushi in 1942 the movie where their plane took off from the pier,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/703kenv
40,entertaining and beautiful scenery,"View from pier was beautiful, ocean and hills. Wide range of entertainers from musicians to snake handling, fun place to people watch. Crowded and very hot, wear sunscreen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/684jenm
40,nice to walk down the Pier,"Enjoyed a walk along the pier, lots of eateries and rides for the kids to do. Nice breeze off the water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/341mareef
30,Don’t go on a Weekend,We visited the pier on a Sunday and it was overly crowded. Not much to see or do unless you’re planning a meal at one of the restaurants or going on the few rides. Rides are very expensive at $5 to $10 a ride unless you buy the unlimited pass for $33. Not many rides so I don’t know if it’s really worth it. We had the Go Card so that was a really good deal and the way to go,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/681glennf
40,Relax on the pier & people watch,Walked from our Marina del Ray accommodation to the Santa Monica Pier and had lunch at the Mexican restaurant Mariasol at the end of the pier and spent time people watching and taking in the views of the beach and the water. Crowds weren’t too bad when we were there which was during lunch and a quite warm day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicoleM8
40,Good visit,"Santa Monica pier is a nice place to visit. Lots of food places and activities going on around the area. Very much like Venice beach you get quite a range of personalities in the area. We visited during the day, not sure how it is at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/475tomy
40,A little bit of movie history with a lot more,"First let's start with the positives , once you get there it's very beautiful , with lots to see and do l. It's very much like in the movies. Walking distance to Muscle Beach,Venice Beach and some other spots worth checking out along the boardwalk. Festive atmosphere which is suitable for the whole family. Beautiful in summer! The negatives are few but something that LA all over could very easily resolve.......traffic! Traffic in and around Los Angeles is like being in a bad their world country! Parking to get to the beach is an experience on its own and even if you want to only go for an hour or 2, parking by the Pier is $14 for a car which feels like extortion as there is no turning back once in a queue. In saying that if are in the area the history with all the movies and shows filmed in and around LA Santa Monica Pier is worth getting to!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grants976
50,Good Old Fashion Carnival. Worth doing once for fun!!,"It’s touristy AND that’s half the fun. Reminds me of being a kid and going to carnival. Enjoy the ferris wheel at least. Great views and can be romantic. Can see Santa Monica to Malibu and to Ranch Palos Verdes. If your lucky, you can see whales and porpoises depending on time of year. Do it!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H9404PGbrianm
40,Checked it off the list,Sunday afternoon visit - pretty much a “checked it off the list” visit. It was a bit too crowded with humanity for us....but very interesting. Better than Venice beachfront for sure. Our older teens enjoyed it. We paid for a great parking spot in Shore Hotel parking deck - right in the middle of the action. Btw that looks like a great hotel. Bought some souvenirs and took pictures under the end of Route 66 sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephaniesudano
40,Interesting with great view of the Pacific,"Really wanted to see the beach while I was in Cali and it was recommended that I go to the pier. Great landmark, with street vendors, street performers, and a great view of the beach. Definitely a must-see if in the area. Shopping and food near by",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/21danib
30,Freak Pier,"Plenty of things to do on the pier like watch the magic show, fishing, games,etc. Good time but you’ll see some freaky people along the way. Not that bad of a scene.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R3980VWpeters
40,"Carousel, ferris wheel, people watching, views, and food...","The restored ferris wheel is a piece of history that was lovingly restored. Take a ride. It's for kids of all ages, even those in their 70s. There is a range of food, from cart with churros, and cotton candy to Andy Gumps for fish, and new fine dining upstairs at the restaurant on the end of the pier. Views of Malibu and Palos Verdes along with vendors hawking, hats, t-shirts and arcades. It is a busy place on the weekend, so go during the week if possible. Parking is below the pier or in the city parking lots a few blocks away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarilynLA
30,Busy and dirty,A lively area with lots going on but very crowded and dirty on a hot day. Worth a quick look but don’t spend too much time here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EDED084
50,Fun for all,We visited the pier while on family vacation and there was something for everyone to enjoy. First off you can enjoy lunch from several different places on the pier while looking out over the Pacific Ocean or stroll through the multiple shops for necessities or souvenirs. The arcade and fair type rides were also fun for the kids. It’s a great place and a must see in Santa Monica.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/birthdaybride
30,Disappointed,"We came to Santa Monica just to visit the pier, and were slightly disappointed. It has an amusement park and some restaurants, but that’s about it. Go to have been there..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/birgitteo777

50,"Awesome place for rides, fun rides & food.","Was staying in Venice Beach but came here with my nieces. Fun place for rides, fun & food. You can also take a walk on the pier to Venice Beach & Muscle Beach. The 3rd st promenade is also walking distance. And you can find some nice restaurants off the pier as well. Follow me on IG: @sara_lv731 for more pics & videos",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W8573BXsarav
30,Its fine,Worth seeing but nothing amazing. There is a very nice beach and I enjoyed walking the board walk not as busy as the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/843dylanl
50,Worth a visit!,Great atmosphere in this touristic attraction in Santa Monica. Lots of small shops and some nice spots for a light meal. Recommended!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shanij60
40,A lovely way to spend a couple of hours,"Visited as a family of 3 (2 adults one very teen 12 year old).We are from the uk and it was our first time to LA.Sat Nav (GPS) took us easily to the Pier from our hotel in universal city and we readily found parking ($15 all day - right next to the beach) although the sat nav appeared to want us to drive on to what looked like the actual entrance to the Pier. We later discovered that you could do that but at the time we weren’t convinced!The pier offers the usual pier type entertainment - souvenirs , buskers, artists, arcade games, refreshments and fair ground rides.My husband and daughter went on the Ferris wheel 🎡 (£7.50 each), the views from the top were great as visibility was good that day.We walked to the end of the pier where locals were fishing.It was memorial weekend when we visited and we had thought it might have been busier than it was. We had a very relaxing and enjoyable time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brownspeeddog
40,Always Worth Visiting,"We have visited the pier a lot over the years, and it tends to change very little. Probably one of the most recognisable piers in the world, it never sleeps. It is always busy, and can be a very interesting place to spend time as there are so many different people and characters. The pier to us, looks tired, something we think it has done for a while, but with everything from, restaurants, fun park attractions, souvenir sellers, to buskers, you won't be disappointed. You can park on the pier for a fee, which is quite reasonable.Go to the end, sit on the stairs and watch the people and sea, it's relaxing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnj965
50,Love this place!,What can I say except that the people watching from this location is superb! The street performers were awesome and the atmosphere was a happy one. We had an amazing time strolling the pier (which is free to walk on) and taking in all the sights and sounds. I will definitely visit again!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blondi1517
50,What a Great place,"We visited for the day, whilst we were based in West Hollywood. It was a great day at the beach that has a classic Cal feel. The pier is a real gem and is buzzing, with stalls and entertainment. We walked along to Venice Beach, about 2 miles, and it was an easy walk. Be careful of the sun as the beach is an open expanse, with a lovely breeze the day we were there, typical high sunburn weather.We wandered around the town after the pier and the beach and there is a great shopping mall near the pier that has some easy food places in if you don’t want to Q at one of the sea view restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phillip63
50,Quite an experience,"The view of the pier at twilight from the beach walk was enticing enough for us to venture out to the pier.It was pumping but you get the impression it’s like that every night.Lots of people, colour, sounds and sensations make for quite an experience.Felt safe despite the crowd and vendors on beach front and bridge.Plenty of great photo opportunities to make lasting memories.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnbG164FE
50,Hire Bikes,Recommend bike riding up to Venice Beach. Busy place but cool as. Good shopping on 3rd street at Bloomingdales,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kazgaz2016
40,Ultimate Pacific coast experience!,"I think this is one thing you have to do if you visit LA. This pier is constantly seen in movies and TV shows and lives up to it's screen reputation. Fun, not fancy, full beach experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bethCincinnati
40,Fun and Iconic!,Lots of shops and an amusement park in the very iconic Santa Monica area. The Pier is famous and doesn't disappoint. We felt safe and it was a fun family experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ATLJulianne
50,So many great picture opportunities! Fun place to visit!,"Although it was very crowded on a Tuesday afternoon when we visited, it was well worth it! There is parking right by the pier for $14. Follow the signs! Since there are no other fees to pay unless you want to, I felt this was a good deal as it is literally to the side of the pier. Very convenient! Yes, there are people trying to sell you items on the pier in addition to actual vendors that pay to sell on the pier, but we weren't bothered by it as it's all part of the experience, The rides were for littler ones, maybe 8 and under so my teen boys did not ride them. There are vendor trucks and few restaurants on the pier, but so many more to the sides of the pier off the beach and just over the pier bridge. I loved that you could sit on the beach and get great pics of the pier from it. We put our feet in the water, but there were many people swimming and boarding ...but it was cold water as expected! There are so may great pic opportunities everywhere you go here.We walked around, sat on the beach for 45 mins and enjoyed lunch outside. Were were here for about 2 1/2 hrs. I could have stayed longer!I hope the details in my review were helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cbjhome
30,Nice walk around,Santa Monica pier is great for kids and family.A lot of rides and games to entertain them. We got some ice cream on the pier and sat watching the sunset over the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelchick119
50,Fun place to visit,"Santa Monica Pier is a ""must-visit"" when you're in the area. There is a ferris wheel, carousel, trapeeze, places to eat, things to buy and great views. You can walk up to 3rd street from it and find lovely shopping. Go early to get parking. You can rent scooters, bicycles etec to ride the boardwalk - even to go Venice from here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArleneB435
40,Must do if you are a tourist,"Of course you need to do the trip if you are in LA but join it up with Venice beachUnless you want to spend the day at the beach sun bathing or going for a swim , you can knock it over in 2 hours add extra time if you want lunch, plenty of course",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/257brettd
40,All you expect it to be.,"We wanted to at least see the Santa Monica Pier once, so that is where we headed to. It what one can expect it to be:) Lots of, loads of, tourists like us. All walking around having fun sitting in the sun. Taking a drink selfies, grabbing a bite and just do nothing. We did not feel like going to the beach here so we only walked to the end of the pier and left after a while. Oter thing to check of our bucket list!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharonL888
50,Santa monica,Really fun place to see and the surrounding areas. You should rent a bike and go all the way to Venice beach from here,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brunocB7328QO
40,Love the photo ops!,"Great spot to walk and shoot some photos. Disappointed that merry go round was not operational but the Ferris wheel was perfect for shooting sunset photos. Go early, it gets very crowded at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NCKari
30,Visit with Family,Have heard and seen so much about the Santa Monica pier that we had to say we had been there. So on that note... I wouldn't go back. Very crowded and over-rated. A tourist trap. The street entertainment was all about getting your money and providing very little show. Takes a long time to get there if traveling from other areas and the parking is terrible. Pretty view of the ocean but you can find that in a less dense area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/486jonathanc
30,Visited with family (kids 7&11),"The Pier is one of the “must see” things in the area. I feel it’s a bit overrated. Of course it is nice to see and you get a nice view of the beach and the sea. If you travel by car, there is a lot of traffic close to the pier, so make sure you have enough time. Close to the pier there is nothing special to see except for the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Misax71
50,Family vacation,"We had a great time at the pier! We actually parked in a parking lot payed $25, and walked over 20 minutes. I suggest parking at the parking lot right at the beach. Love the entertainment and great restaurants!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/227kishan
40,An Interesting Look Back in Time,"Great place to see a different life style. Rides, arcades, street performers, and even people fishing. Was lucky enough to see a seal looking for food. Worth a couple of hours!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/313freddya
50,LA City Tours,"We visited Santa Monica Pier through the above and would recommend them thoroughly. What a fantastic place with everything possible available to eat, drink or souvenirs to buy on the pier itself, so really a leisurely walk is all that’s needed. Of course Santa Monica itself is beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandraf516
50,A splendid view ....,"If you visit Santa Monica, you have to go here ...It's a very nice place for everyone. You can see Venice Beach in all its splendor. You have a beautiful view of the city, but also of the ocean ....Lots of attractions... A great place !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/baciucarmaciu
40,Don't miss this during your LA Trip!,"Don't miss this during your LA Trip! Santa Monica Pier is a great upbeat place with beach, shopping, restaurants, theme park. You name it, they have it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarwarmazid
40,Choise the pier,"Beach or pier. Large clean beach. I headed for the pier / Lots to see and do on a lovely warm day. You can go on the rides, people watch, get food or a drink. Easy to get round if you are disabled . Had a couple of hours here on a coach holiday",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helensims61

50,Expensive - but good!,Four of us visited this pier- lots of attractions; great location; good street entertainment. However everything seemed expensive but that’s the way it is I guess!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patglynn
50,Packed out,"We drove the Route 66 and got to the end of trail in Santa Monica Pier. It was aroynd 6pm and it was totally packed. The pier activities were quirky! There were amusement arcades, fair rides, shops, photo ops, even had a 3 DJ 'Hush' disco!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JDME15
20,A real disappointment!,"After all the reviews I read and all the hype, I was expecting something amazing. This pier is overcrowded with tourists, expensive food stalls/shops and is really outdated! I thought it would be romantic, but its really not, but then again I guess I am spoil with the most amazing beaches in South Africa that absolutely outclass Santa Monica!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GregTitaliano
30,Better in films,"Maybe I was expeting something especial but it's something you can see but not a ""must to do"".It's a pitty because the location is nice, but it looks old and unsafe..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/red-dany
50,Route 66,"Iconic location, the end of Route 66!Ate at Bubba Gumps on the pool pier, watched the ferris wheel and visited some of the shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G1176FOkathyh
30,Classic old pier,Very busy on the weekend and lots of street vendors to take in. We rode the ferris wheel for $10 each. The views were nice. The staff does a nice job.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plastx2
30,"Fun, but crowded","Fun to visit the pier and beach, but be prepared for crazy traffic,tons of people on the pier and beach and have time set aside to try and find parking. The parking situation is insane. We drove around for almost an hour trying to find a spot in one of the little parking g lots. There is a charge to park too. It's not much, but be prepared for that too. The pier was hard to get around on with all of the people, but still fun to look around. It was worth going to once, but won't be back any time soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianedN2525IL
50,Always a dream,Been here so many times and I never fail to come back for more. I'll will admit that I don't always come for the concessions. There's just something about a nice long stroll that brings peace to my heart and then sometimes I'll enjoy my favorite brew and take everything in. I don't know about everyone and what everyone likes. All I know is that it's nice to visit and everyone young and old can enjoy it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C4772SSjaimec
50,"Love it! Go as soon as stores opens, not earlier","Start your visit as soon as stores opens.. I came too soon and only see fisherman’s. Kind of sad vibe.. As was taking too long to get running, I prefer to rent a bike downstairs and go by seaside until Venice Beach. Back after couple hours, the Pier looks like other different place, full of people and movement. Liked a lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emanuel_alb
50,Good place to take a walk or bicycle ride to on Saturday Morning,Rode a bike from my Doubletree hotel in Marina Del Rey up the beach and back. You can lock the bike on the pier. Stop at Ben and Jerry's on the way back. Be careful transiting the heavy street traffic around the MDR harbor before you reach the bike trail.Enjoy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drandrewwharrell

30,Tourist trap with all of the tourist trappings!,"There are so many other piers to go to. I guess this place is iconic, but really carnival like. I wouldn’t recommend eating there or staying too long either. Crowded, cheesy, your better off going up a few blocks to Santa Monica’s 3rd street promenade. Way more classy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pizzaexplorer
50,Food and Fun for Everyone,There are alternate routes to get there to avoid traffic on the interstate highway. Finding parking can be tricky. Lots of restaurants and souvenir shops. And of course the rides.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/narelab
10,Not our favorite,"We went to the pier and the view over the beaches was nice, but not really a must be place - at least not for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bjoernl219
30,Not the full experience...,"The Santa Monica pier was rented out for a party so my family and I didn’t get to enjoy the rides...the whole point of the trip!!!!

Beware of hecklers: people handing out bracelets demanding donations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gabstravelblog

40,It is an Iconic Must See,"Realistically, it overall isn't perfect, but it is such an iconic place to visit. I mean if you drive all the way here, you have to get out and step on the beach then walk down the pier to the end. It is the end of Route 66. The Ferris wheel is beautiful especially if you see it at sundown. It was a great experience and I enjoyed dinner at the restaurant at the end and watched the sun go down. Great pictures, fun, relaxing spot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Araae1

40,ONE OF MUST SEE PLACES NEAR LA GREAT EXPERIENCE,One of our must see stops in the area. It was a lot of fun. We went early on Sat. morning and we got close parking on street. Pier is truly magical. Just what you hear it is. Corny but its supposed to be. Ate hot dog at Japadog and it was great. We planned to ride ferris wheel and when we got there the park was closed for a private event CAN YOU IMAGINE HAVING THAT MUCH MONEY. Broke my heart not to get to ride this famous wheel. The pier is great fun. Recommend it to any of you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/revrick33

The atmosphere is fun, inviting and filled with local artist sharing their works and musicians playing their original tunes. Fishermen are almost always present dotted along the boardwalk as you enjoy the rides, dine on fun-fair-food, or enjoy the fine-end- dining found at the end of the pier. The perfect way to end your day? Stroll out to the end of the pier and take in a beautiful sunset sinking down below the horizon of the vast pacific ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryhaarmeyer

40,Gem of California,"This famous pier is located a few meters away from the Famous ""Hotel California"". What am I talking about? Remember the song Hotel California by the Eagles, the pier is close by. It sucks that they are changing the name of the hotel :(Anyway back to my Santa Monica pier review :) The pier has a small amusement park for children and adults, fast food restaurants and restrooms. Take a lovely walk out on the pier and enjoy the amazing view and cool breeze. Don't forget to take photos by the famous Route 66 sign post. There's free parking if you're driving for both sedans and mini buses.You cannot visit California and not go down to the pier. Ok, so I'm going to play the Hotel California song now.

The ocean, shops, musicians, and artisans were fun to experience. The end of Route 66 brought us to the pier along with the ocean of course. We saw a sea lion and dolphins which was a treat. After purchasing t-shirts and eating lunch we headed to the ocean. The beach was not overly crowded and so we just sat and enjoyed the view. This would be a perfect family trip in my opinion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AR1350
40,Ferris Wheel was nice,"The Ferris wheel offered an unexpectedly beautiful view over Santa Monica. It looks like a tiny attraction but you easily overlook the buildings along the coast for a beautiful 360 panoramic view of the entire coastal strip. There's a cost to this: ten dollars per person. Unless you have a valid Go LA Card, which offers unlimited rides for the entire amusement park, all day long Luckily I did. The pier itself wasn't that special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/010bertv
30,Ok for a visit,"Good to visit for tourist site seeing but we only spent 15 mins actually on the pierAfter a quick look around we hired electric bikes and rode down to Venice beach, now that was cool!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Glenn_20c
40,Interesting afternoon,"We went here on a Friday afternoon. It wasn’t overly crowded on the pier and we didn’t have to wait very long for anything. We rode the Ferris wheel for $10/pp. The ride actually lasted about 6-7 minutes which was longer than we expected. We had to park at the Wyndham hotel nearby for $20. What we liked about the day was seeing the sea lions off the end of the pier, seeing all of the interesting talent/ both good and mediocre, and the beautiful views of the water and hills. We didn’t eat here as we waited for Venice Beach and Abbot Kinney. The pier has a carnival feel but is quaint and fun. The Route 66 shop was cool just to look at and watching the fishermen off the pier was enjoyable with music playing in the background. There are lots of photo opportunities here and overall it was a fun way to spend a few hours. We wouldn’t likely return but families with younger kids would likely enjoy the rides and games. They do have a wristband that you can purchase for endless rides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mandy007
50,Beautiful Walk,"We stayed at Venice Beach and walked up to the pier. Wow, just fantastic. Beautiful beach and views. The carnival on the Pier was a buzz. I highly recommend a visit here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robyn_Freeman
40,Attracts the crowds,"Was surprised how many people were on the pier. It is a popular spot with plenty going on. A good place to go and just watch what is going on from dancers to singers performing on the pier. Lots of stalls and shops selling small goods and food, a lovely evening out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJAllen16
40,Good Spot For A Wander,Spent some time wandering around taking in the sights.We were here before summer when it was fairly quiet and during summer once it got busier. Enjoyed both. Has a good vibe to the place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BelongaVic

30,End off 66 trip,"Visited pier to complete our Route 66 trip. The pier and beach are fabulous, the only negative are the amount off homeless people that are about .

50,Super Fun! Plus one hidden spot,"The Santa Monica Pier is just pure fun. We took our family there and met another family. We ate lunch, let the kids ride a few rides, people watched. It was a great day. One tip: just buy parking. It’s impossible to find so save yourself the time and heartache.There is also a hidden old fashioned soda fountain. When you come down the main ramp, do a u-turn to the left. It’s in the old carousel building. They have killer milkshakes, malts, and real soda-pops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/penguinpi

Pier is always fun to walk around, can sit at beach or rent a bike or stroll along the path toward Venice beach not far away. Recommend you find the end of Route 66 sign and watch some local buskers.

I wouldn't revisit this area.Although go a few streets back to the shopping area, this is very clean and a different atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ahky12
30,LA beach visit,"As we were staying in a hotel near LAX, we thought we would visit Santa Monica Pier as it wasn’t too far from our hotel and you can get there without having to get a an LA freeway.We weren’t too sure about parking so we ended up parking about 1 kilometer from the Pier (USD15 for parking).You can park right next to the pier - we found out later.The Pier was interesting, I guess we were expecting more, things looked a little run down and in need of some TLC.It was a nice day to visit and there were lots of people about. There were plenty of spots to get a drink or food and souvenirs.Back on land, there were some nice restaurants around and a very nice boutique shopping centre.Santa Monica Pier was ok, nothing to write home about though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/194shanek

50,I loved this place!!,"The pier!!! OMG. I love this place!! It is beautiful, entertaining, and inviting!! There is so much to do too! There are some rides on he pier, you can hang at the beach, or you can watch the sunset!! Also, they have bird scooters around here so you could park by the pier and “scoot” to Venice in no time!! I HIGHLY recommend this place!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rhaight12
50,Great Fun!,After lunch and a stroll we visited the Santa Monica Pier with our 5 year old who couldn’t wait to have a go on the rides! Buying the wristbands for the little one is well worth it. If I remember correctly a child wristband was about $18. Lots of different rides and a great day out,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/npalla
40,Santa Monica Pier,"We used the backdrop as a photo op this time, but we’ve ventured onto the pier before. This is really a must-do attraction for Santa Monica, as it is very easy to access and you can stay for as little or as long as you want.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L5987ZOpaulf

50,Classic,"The pier has food, shops, entertainment by local artists, and an amusement park. What more could you want?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OhioLove2travel007
40,A great day trip!,"The Santa Monica Pier is one of our go-to things in LA. We make it out twice per year to unwind. The people watching is one of the best parts. There are plenty of performers working for tips as well as little souvenir shops. We make it a point to eat at Bubba Gump's on the pier. The ferris wheel is $10 per person and well worth it. You get great views of the area. Probably the best view around. Parking is $14. I suggest pulling in to the parking lot and pulling away as far as possible from the pier. Park as close to Hwy 1 as possible to avoid congestion when leaving. People always look for the closest spot and if you leave late, it can be like trying to get out of the old Disneyland parking lot back in the day. Have a few $1 bills for the performers. Tip a $1 and they don't mind posing for a photo or taking one with you. If you ant to park on the pier it's self, get there at the crack of dawn.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SalP909
30,Cool Place but way to busy.,"Walking down the Pier was cool, the weather was nice, pier performers were funny. We visited one afternoon which was chill and again one evening which was crazy. Way too busy for a small area. Kinda of a mix between commercial and recreational.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevenhD4733WL

It was super packed and long line up to eat on the pier but loads of other places around to choose from.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianaj326
40,Great for walking or people watching,"We stayed close to the Pier and at night would walk around the Pier. The food is overpriced, but it's worth checking out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ginat4134
50,Enjoyed the pier,"The pier was very interesting with vendors, rides, entertainment and restaurants plus the walk way along the beach. It was also the end of Route 66. It was worth the stop!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Msquit
30,Very picturesque but be careful!,This is a very beautiful site! Lots of activities and food options for everyone! Please be careful of your belongings. A visitor from Europe had her newly purchased Tshirt stolen (in a plastic bag) while she was on the beach! My suggestion is to just ignore all the weird characters that hang out here!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Petuniatokkie
20,Run down and overhyped,"The iconic pier was very disappointing. After an uncomfortable cycle along Venice Beach, I already had low expectations of the pier and I was proven correct. The pier is run down and filled with arcades and tacky souvenirs. The view is nice and sun down, but then you want to be off the beach asap as it doesn't feel too safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lalls92

40,Touristy but fun,"My kids had a blast, it's fun, lively, and a great tourist spot. The beach is clean and maintained. The rides and arcade is very outdated and not in the least bit clean. Lots of fun restaurants and places to stop for a drink.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moabs1987
40,Busy Saturday in energetic crowd!,"If you want to experience the Santa Monica Pier when it’s fun and busy, then a Saturday afternoon will give all of your senses a workout. You can spend money and/or just walk around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JALToronto
30,Enjoyable visit with junky souvenirs,"Visited the pier as a “first stop” when I arrived in Santa Monica. A “must do” I suppose, as it is considered an icon. It is fairly popular with quite a few visitors there at the time. Good views across the beach and a nice vista across Santa Monica, looking to the Santa Monica Mountains and up to Malibu. Amusements look fun but I didn’t ride them. Rollercoaster, Ferris wheel, Trapeze school and others. A range of buskers all vying for attention. Typical souvenir sales. Restaurants with standard tourist-precinct food. An enjoyable stroll and worth a visit. My friend and I spent an hour or so there. Mostly enjoyed the nostalgic feel of the place. Took some nice photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeterF_Syd
50,Beautiful,"So much fun to people watch & sight see. Good FOOD to try & rides.

40,Nice sand,"Large beach with long stretch of yellow sand. Long walk to the water, which is quite flat. Not a lot of amenities so bring own food & drinks",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lyndellpp
40,Do the Pier,Lots of people! Lots of vendors selling their souvenirs on the pier. Street artist waiting to sketch your portrait in pencil or clay. You will see it all!You can park on the pier if your lucky to find a spot. Lots of pay to park garages with a short walk to the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WSINGUY
30,Santa Monica Pier at night,Fun place with a carnival feel to it. We did not go on the rides but walked along the board walk and visited Bubba Grump Shrimp for Dinner which was fun and tasty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/88cs
50,A must see iconic attraction,"A great place to visit with the family. Lots of activities for kids include a merry go round, aquarium, roller coaster & more. Lots of food choices and cheap parking at $3 per hour ($15 max price).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Raineybeth
50,Great!,We were able to spend 2 hours in Santa monica pier. We were dropped off by our bus tour in there and we walked by the shore. Great experience since We came from Canada and we arent located by the coast line. We enjoyed the scenery. We went to the pier and took pictures and buy some foods. It was so good! We have great time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sumanism

30,Just peered in,"We really expected more from this pier . The parking was a nightmare to find and then so expensive . The shops were dull , and the shop at the end of the pier which is supposed to celebrate the end of route 66 well that was awful . Expected more . It could be so much more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sirah2013
30,End of the road,"Great to see the end of Route 66 commemorated here. But that's about as far as it goes. The pier itself is a bit scruffy and in need of some tlc. Still, it's a box-tick trip that you have to do if you're in town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bryanedwin
40,You only need a few hours,"The pier can be done and dusted in halfA day. Yes its an icon, but there is so many people smoking weed and homeless about it really ruins it.

40,Good Fun For All,"Decent amusement park right on the pier ! Nice folks, decent rides and a lot of games to be had. Worth a visit. Huge arcade but crowded. Plenty of shops and food as well.

30,TRUE REVIEW OF SANTA MONICA PIER,Visited this Pier recently for the first time.Its obviously a very Historic pier and right at the end of Route 66.There are various shops and listings with reference to Route 66 dotted around the pier.The pier is showing signs of age and wear and tear plus there are quite a few homeless people around the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ccfceuropesNO1
40,Good family fun,"The pier has lots of food, games, and rides. There are street performers along the pier. The beach is wide and clean. Parking though it seems easy is a nightmare to get out - worse than a concert- I would park in one of the decks across the street next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drlisat
50,Santa Monica,Vibrant area with alot of tourists found this place very relaxing to just sit and watch everything shops were great and a good variety,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizp908
40,Fun Experience for my first time visit!,"As a tourist, I find my experience to be enjoyable! The Santa Monica Pier is the quintessential spot for tourists to see when they first visit the city, and I didn't regret visiting! There's carnival-style food, games, mini rides, live performers, and a great view of the ocean, so there's plenty to do. However, what makes me rate my experience 4 out of 5 stars comes down with my personal taste and interests. The pier is more catered to families with young children, and as an adult solo traveler, I ended up leaving earlier to go to the nearby beach as there were more crowds coming in the afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reesarei
20,Time to upgrade.,"The Pier is a must see when you visit Santa Monica, for the historical value. The rides are sub par. If the California coastal society will permit it is time to improve the rides. The shops are very typical for a midway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/douglass957
20,Meh. I didn't like it.,"As a tourist with limited time, I definitely wish we would've spent more time in Venice than coming to this area because it was so ridiculously crowded for my taste and kind of dirty. But we fell in love with a restaurant in the area, ""Cha Cha Chicken"", and luckily that made the time worth it, but Santa Monica Pier itself? I don't think I'll be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brookea674
10,Got Robbed,"This place is a centre for crime. We parked our car at a secure car park. When we got bank everything from our car was missing.Reported it to Police and we were told that there are gangs who operate in this area. They specifically target rental cars. They have all the master keys.Please be very careful when you park your car in a car park. Try and use on street parking visible to people. Less chances of getting robbed.Our holiday was ruined as we lost luggage, cash, passport, IPad, laptop etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/215nidhiw
30,Pier was Okay but not a Destination,"When in LA the Santa Monica pier is always a top place that people have to see, we spent 15 minutes there walking the pier then went to the beach. The pier was nice but nothing special. The walk along the beach on the bike path and the outdoor gym was more entertaining which is located next to the pier. Many bikes and scooters to rent and take along the path!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joshkarpinski
50,Girlfriend treating me!,"This was an absolute treat by my girlfriend whilst staying in Los Angeles, she took me here cause she knew i loved playing the video game (Grand Theft Auto) and it was a surreal moment when i stepped foot onto the beach and got taken back to the best childhood of my life",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/283luker

50,Great walking pier but park is separated,The pier itself was a fun evening walk with the kids to people-watch and watch the sunset. We were hoping to enjoy the rides but it is gated off from the pier walking area and there is an admissions fee ($30) for rides and food. We did not know prior.Great spot for pictures though!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X8210EPdebrab

50,Loved it!,We stopped here for a few hours on our way down to Laguna Beach. My daughter and I loved the Ferris wheel and coaster. Beautiful views of the city and Pacific Ocean. I recommend wresting tennis shoes as the print is a bit I level and harder to walk on in sandals.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilypD425ZY
30,Reminds me of Blackpool pleasure beach!,"Whilst on a brief trip to Los Angeles we had to check out the Santa Monica pier.It’s very old school and reminded me of a place in the UK, Blackpool pier.Fast food and churros a plenty along with some fun rides for the kids - light up toys sold all over, had a great atmosphere. Prob would not go back again as there just isn’t that much to do ( unless it’s a nice day and you had some time at the beach also)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oscarskye
40,So many fun and distracting sights and smells,"We just missed the sun dropping below the horizon, but its such a beautiful and fun spot to explore!

A must see if you are kn the area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mutinyluv
20,Turistic and outdated!,"If you must go, go. If you are not close to the area don't bother, better yet, just drive past it so you can say, ""I saw it"". Cheap trinkets everywhere and bad entertainers :( The view is not spectacular once you get to the end, just a bunch of tourists pretending it's exciting. Sad that no love has been put into such a popular landmark!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wsalin23
40,Good vibes,"magnificent place and exactly as seen in the 80s or 90son the pier there are many refreshment points and gadgets.I advise you to park in the neighboring streets but avoid too expensive ""public parking"" 40 $ daily rate.on the pier you can rent a bike to reach Venice Beach along the busy but fantastic cycle path.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luiAndre84
30,Just Average,"Visited with my husband on a Thursday after noon. This was our first visit to the pier after several recommendations. There were not very many vendors there and it may have because it was mid-week or due to the gloomy/cloudy weather. We saw several aspiring muscians performing, a magician, and a clown but did not venture over to the ""amusment park"" side of the pier. There were crowds of people coming and going but other than that not much more going on. It was beautiful to see the mountains line the horizon into the ocean. Santa Monica Pier...been there and done that. No desire at this time to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teamlayton3

50,Walk out over the ocean,"If you are in Los Angeles, the Santa Monica pier is rather a must-see. People watching, boardwalk vendors, a small amusement park, and most important...the views! Take a ride on the ferris wheel for the most amazing view around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevew11
30,Nothing like any others :/,This Pier is nothing different to any other Pier I've been to ...maybe apart from large numerous of people that ask you directly to donate/give them money.At the moment the Pier is undergoing some works but it does not affect the access at all (just a bit more noise).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanaManchester
50,A Memorable Beach visit on Memorial Day 2018,What an Epic Pier(end of the road for Route 66) and clean beach with so many fun attractions. Got there early (I arrived 10am) on a holiday. Left at 3:30pm to what appeared to be thousands of people on the Pier. Parked in a multi-level garage closeby and adjacent to a premium shopping mall but no mall parking validation. Super convenient to get in and out of the area quickly. Perfect spot for families and CA Fun in the Sun. No dogs allowed on the beach. Thankful for all the VERY visible law enforcement and life guards on duty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Real_Liza614
30,It is what it is,A nice place to visit to kill some time. A few places to eat and some photo opportunities. Can get busy. Nothing special but good to tick off the list.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B0b1314
30,"Many visits , many memories","We visited here a six years back on Christmas. We loved the experience of being at the ocean on a relatively warm, day in winter. We quickly decided to move to Los Angeles and after some time to make it happen did. It’s not the best thing about LA, but we do still love to visit from time to time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/learnincurv
30,Just OK,"Visited here on memorial weekend - along with hoards of others. Some good views and a few nice terrace-type bars or cafes.Heaps of shops selling tourist type stuff, plenty of churros sellers and a few buskers.An entertainment park type set-up at the end.Not worth a special visit, but if you are the neighbourhood...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CactusRose
30,Let's ride it!,"‘Ello chaps!Santa Monica Pier is a…well by now you know, it’s a pier. In Santa Monica, California.It’s about an hour’s drive from downtown LA, about half an hour from LAX.The main draw of the pier are the live artists singing for tips, the slew of restaurants, and the amusement park. Yeah, on the pier. A park on the pier. Rollercoaster, ferris wheel, and jug drop game.The ride prices are based on how much you want to do, and don’t seem bad.Near the pier is a large, extensive beach, with plenty of walking and outdoor gym/playground gear.It’s no wonder this area is an attraction for locals and tourists alike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HerbertEdgewood
30,Overrated,It's definitely a must if you go to Santa Monica but I would say it's overrated. Don't regret going though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/403TravelBug
40,Always leave feeling better than I arrived,The pier is a bit tacky but it is an enjoyable place. Watching the sunset on the end of the pier is amazing. Reminds me of a simpler time. Always some characters on the pier to keep everyone entertained for a while,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SlinkyCracker
40,Great for a stoll....,"Great for a stroll on sunny day, but some of the attractions are better for kids. We hired bikes from the pier and spent an afternoon on the boardwalk which was worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahfearnleyhalifax
40,A Very Good Place - not Great - but a Must See,"I have been to LA and this area a hundred times and love all of it. And with saying that, It is hard to say that the pier is overrated but that is how I feel about it. Its a legendary iconic location with tens of thousands of pics being taken of the pier and ferris wheel etc. It is fun so dont get me wrong but it isnt Great or Excellent and it is a little too gritty now which is unfortunate,.. Years ago it was great - not now. If you go at night you will be fine but not without worry like it was at one time. Fun and memorable and a must see. Try it during the day too - beaches are massive!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrvlsEatsExplrs
40,Worth a visit,We were lucky the day we went as it was not too busy and you would walk along the pier without it being overcrowded. Plenty to do and see and the views along the coast in either direction were stunning.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PMACCA
40,Must do when in LA,"One of things what is what you expect, busy, a little tacky but not to its detriment, plenty to see and places to get souvenirs and snacks or drinks. A great view of Santa Monica from the end.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goonerdspa66
40,Well worth a visit!,Santa Monica Pier is well worth a visit when in the area! It has a selection of rides that would keep children occupied! What makes the pier so interesting is the street performers! Some incredibly talented people perform there everyday!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsteveng2017
40,Best part of Santa Monica,"If you ever go to Santa Monica, you are most likely going come here and it might just be the highlight of your day. It was for mine! I mostly loved the view of the ocean and the great part about this pier is that you can’t miss it! (Mostly because of the giant Ferris wheel) There is fast food along the pier and I would recommend the Bubba Gump Shrimp restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesecret
20,"Typical tourist trap, not worth the visit.","This place is like so many others in the US (Navy Pier, Wharf in SF) and not worth the time. The 3rd Ave Promenade has great shopping and is just a couple of blocks away. Highly overrated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevinwcheryl
50,2 day stay - across the road from the pier,"Iconic, fun, smaller than i pictured and packed most times of the day. It’s only open 11-8pm - slightly disappointing as i wanted to take night pics from the wheel. It was so cold too. Some great food in terms of burgers etc. All in all good fun once though. Doubt it would be much different a second visit. Street performers are fun to watch but remember to tip as its poor form not to. Easy access to the beach - nice to have wooden walkways most of the way to the water & seats.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/didjjetta
40,Checked off the bucket list,An iconic place but mostly just a bunch of tourists and kids. It was mostly a tourist trap with junk stores and poor quality food but all in a neat setting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DawgExplorer
30,May 2018,"Got parked up off the front early on sunday. Paid about $5 for multistorey parking lot near Mackies. Parking by the pier on the front was $14 per day. Walked on pier which was great. Watching the shops open up. Walked along front then to Vennice Beach. Which was a little shocking when youre not used to seeing people exist living rough on the beach/sidewalks. Dont get me wrong its not full of homeless, but theres a few. Yes you get asked for change by one or two. The shops and stalls sell loads of seaside tatt. Tshirts, beachwear etc. We stopped for a 'cawffee' at a nice little cafe and people watched. It was Mothers day so busy. Then walked back to Santa Monica. We then revisited the pier which is very 'seasidey'. Rides shops stalls and a fair. We found the shopping center or Mall. Lots of upmarket shops,bars resturants etc. Visited ""Vonns"" which is a supermarket to get some bits n bobs. A bit like Asda.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simontI7573RE
40,We stayed nearby,We enjoyed the uniqueness of the pier. It was a good place to grab some food and enjoy a different view of the ocean. The place does get pretty busy on the weekends.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/517donnaw
50,Great place for hangout,"A great place to spend time with family and friends. I spent almost a day enjoying the beach, food and view there. One of the top attractions in LA, a must visit. There are many public parking area along the beach and there is one just besides Monica Pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jakeylow23
40,Really fun night time activity,We got the all rides pass and didn’t regret them! We had loads of fun on the rides however found the carnival games very expensive so chose not to do them. A really famous place and worth the visit both in day time or night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joshcutt
40,Classic Pier on a perfect day,"A great place to stroll and spend a few hours enjoying the views, having fun at Pacific Park or enjoying a meal.When we visited there were several entertainers at work on the pier... a magician, several musicians and caricature artists as well as many souvenir vendors with their carts.Spend at least one or two hours enjoying this sight.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lwj
50,Memorial Day weekend. Fun!,"Crowded, but it’s a sunny holiday weekend! Great people watching. Lots of expected chain stores and expensive shops, but a great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauriec144
50,Must get a “bird” scooter to see it all,"We were only in LA for 2 days so when we arrived we saw these bird scooters around everywhere and decided to try them to see as much as we could as quickly as possible!We went about all the way from Santa Monica pier to Venice beach and back and it only cost a few $There is so much to see along the way so you can just get off and then pick up another one when you see one.The beach is lovely and clean and the pier is great, there are some great spots to have food also.There is public WiFi but it sometimes goes offThere are public toilets which seemed better than UK public toilets in terms of cleanliness",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E8LHX
50,Spend an entire afternoon here and didn't want to leave,My friends and I drove here from downtown LA and the commute wasn't difficult at all. It was our first time seeing the Pacific Ocean and we were not disappointed. The beach was so beautiful and not crowded. We loved the pier. It was buzzing with activity and is very family oriented. There are several carnival rides including the ferris wheel which we went on for only $10 each which was really worth it. We stayed until around 10pm and enjoyed every minute of being there. There is a nice Mexican restaurant near the end of the pier but beware it isn't open very late.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/urbantraveler1234
50,Amazing experience,"Beautiful beach, nice food joints, other entertaining activities. Its one of the busiest places in LA, weekend gets more crowded. During my LA stay In visited this twice, spent almost whole day there. It gets colder/windy by evening but offer great tourist experience. Do try out nearby food options, some of them are real good!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/badshahazam
40,Very nice visit,"This was a very nice place to visit. We had a great meal at at restaurant at the end of the pier also. Lots of rides for kids and big kids alike. And so much better than the very over rated nearby Venice and Muscle Beaches.Santa Monica pier is also the end of the “Route 66” journey, so I found out on our visit.This really is a must see, even if it’s only for a short time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyGeorge67
50,With friends despite the rain and the cold.,The pier was lovely. Felt like a beach fun fair with the beautiful scenery in the background.I'm not sure whether I liked it because of my group of friends (14) or whether I was really hurt to see the number of homeless people digging through bins for the food.The number of homeless people in Santa Monica did shock me and I'm a Londoner!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sim_Mcs_World
50,Perfect Memorial Day & Summer Weekend Destination,"Spring in Santa Monica is gorgeous. Clear, brisk weather off the ocean, amazing views, people watching, shopping and food. The Pier is the place to start, then shop on 3rd street, and walk the board walk to Venice. Its a full day of fun for the entire family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyFi18
40,Fun,"Went during sunset and it was gorgeous!! It has rides, places to eat, the beach, bring a sweater it can get chilly",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chindoll4o7
40,Nice,It’s a place to go! We were there a Monday night and was very silent. We didn’t have too much fun. But you must go here. We enjoy better Malibu and Venice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Iscdem
50,Perfect Day with Family,"Santa Monica Pier is a touristy place, but it’s a fun touristy place! Lots of choices to eat, from local to chain (Bubba Gump’s is a favorite).The beach is pristine. There is a little parking near the beach, but there is a convenient parking garage at 3rd street that has the first 90 minutes free and inexpensive prices after that. The small shopping center is next to the parking garage.There are places to fish, a couple of entertainers on the pier, and the carnival rides.There is a marker /photo op for the end of Route 66.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myzygy
50,Fun place,"Fun to visit. Some people may spend a long time, but we usually stay for a bit over an hour in the attractions. Nice view of Santa Monica from the Ferris wheel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flavia_travel
30,Sunset at the Santa Monica Pier,"Unfortunately I found the pier overrated. I guess because it's been featured in movies, etc it does give one a romantic perception of the place. Good to walk on to say you've been there but nothing really to see apart from timing your visit with the sunset which is beautiful from the pier (or the beach, if you're there too).I'm not sure about the rides and stuff there as I personally did not go for them, but a little small area compared again to what you may have perceived from movies. Pleasant enough but not to spend hours and hours of your time. Do take pictures with the iconic ferries wheel and walk to the end of the pier for a 'Santa Monica pier location' shot.Look down and you won't miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jaylee272
50,Beautiful anyway,I love the beach in this city and I feel like visiting there again with someone special! It’s very great that they have an amusement park besides the beautiful beach!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josephtE334VF
50,Great place for a family outing in the evenings,"We visited LA in May, and we were at the pier of Santa Monica for dinner on a sunday night...lots of things to do, local vendors, street food, souveniers and lovely ocean views. Parking is expensive thou.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chefrj
50,Great day!,It’s very unique and family friendly. We ate at the Mexican place at the end of the pier and it was very delicious and great customer service!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobbiew873
40,Beach view and swiming,"Santa Monica pier had a fabulous view. You can visit the beach walk the pier, and swim then have a quick meal. There are street walk performers who dance and sing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D4278GKjulieb
40,Great views,"The pier is great, lots of interesting people to watch and things to see.Parking was easy and not overly expensive.The amusement park isn’t cheap but it’s ok and the views from the roller coaster are cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Redgenz
50,It’s kitsch but it’s always fun,"A walk on the Santa Monica Pier is always a source of good vibes. It’s often crowded, but happily so, and with all sorts of people from families with your children to retirees, different ethnicities (more than most places in Santa Monica) and different styles. There are fully adequate places to eat and drink but one comes for the Pier itself - and of course the beach below, which remains perhaps LA’s best walking beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/91craigc
50,A must see!,"There is something about Santa Monica that always leaves me in awe! Despite being overcrowded by tourists, the pier is a very special place. Definitely take your time there and make sure to park your car far enough to enjoy the beauty of Santa Monica before you reach the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/virgin2018
40,Lovely beach but not venice,Nice beach walk and fun on the pier.Worth seeing although not masses to do here but you couldn’t come to LA and not come to Santa Monica,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/morago675
30,Must do but expensive and crowded,"You have to do it when your in Santa Monica, but it was not the highlight of our trip. I thought my 13 Year old daughter would love it and it was just okay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DESYLAY123
30,Tacky,"This was a glorified carnival. It had really expensive rides and carnival games. We spent forever in traffic from LA and then got swindled for parking (Do NOT park with SafetyPark!!). We went on a chilly day, so we were disappointed we couldnt see the beach. Overall, it was expensive and overrated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/173cieraj
40,Fun Place to Stop,"We only had a couple of hours in LA, and decided to hit up Santa Monica Pier and Griffith Park. Santa Monica was really cool and interesting, and unlike anything I've visited before. The weather when we visited was cold and cloudy but I still enjoyed it! We got there pretty early so parking was quite easy and plentiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ErylbyExplore
40,Walk through history,Historic Santa Monica Pier is still a great view of the Pacific with lots of shopping and food vendors. The ferris wheel and carnival atmosphere is fun. Loved everything about it and the weather was great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JEBCV
50,Place for all ages,"The Santa Monica Pier is a great place for all ages. Whether you are planning to come with your family or to go on a date this is a great place full of activities for everyone. It is fun to go during the day to see the water but it is also very pretty at night when all the lights on the rides light up, I would recommend going at night. With the rides just like a carnival they also have booths with food and there is actually a restaurant on the pier where you can go to eat and enjoy the lights. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves carnivals and having fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmahS5800HV

30,Small Pier!,It has a small Carnival and basically a short walk of a pier. Few food and shopping choices. Just a touristy place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BerlynCC
30,Popular Tourist Stop,"Santa Monica Pier is fun but definitely a popular tourist stop with LOTS of foot traffic and the shops and restaurants nearby are built as such. The pier itself has the typical souvenir vendors, musicians, and carnival like foods. Walk down to the end for a great view of the coast. Parking can be difficult and we found the cheapest and best parking to be down in the general lot close to the beach and beneath the pier. Most hotels and parking garages up from the pier will charge 15-20 for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AEMorrison
40,Wish we had more time,"Decided to visit before we went to a Dodgers game. Pier carnival opened at 11 I think and was a lot of fun with all the street performers. Headed down to Muscle Beach where we wish we had more time, maybe next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheKDodd
30,Over Worked Pier,The Pier is nice but it is serviving on it name. It is defferently a tourest location. My wife wanted to visit the pier so we did. The town of Santa Monica is a much nicer place to walk around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Johnp5556
50,Nice Sunset,On my last evening I went for Dinner to Santa Monica and spent a walk at The shore ! Its a really relaxing atmosphere with a lot of good places for food !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oew
40,Nice stop along the PCH!,"Our first stop along the PCH was the Santa Monica Pier. It had stunning views of the ocean and Santa Monica. We went early, so the rides weren't open yet, but we walked around and got coffees. You can park at the pier for only $1 an hour, so definitely do that if you don't plan on being there for very long!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmyC6404
30,Iconic Landmark,"If you're visiting Santa Monica you have to come here. Having said that it really is nothing special. Lots of tacky souvenir shops, buskers and stalls. Good views of the shoreline and beaches.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wizzo2016
50,Must visit,We loved our brief visit to the pier. Enjoyed take away lunch from bubba Gump as we sat on the peir people watching. Wished we had more time to explore the little stores and rides. We only had about an hour. Give yourself a few.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daphadills

40,Fun Time,My young daughter and I visited this place in May 2018. The weather was beautiful. First off I would say parking right at the pier is worth the $14. It is only a couple minute walk to the pier itself from the parking lot. It also has easy access on and off the main highway. Take your camera as there’s many great photo opportunities. It was crowded but not crazy when we visited. Lots of cool shops and vendors not to mention rides :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JR6442
50,absolutely amazing,"all i ever dreamt is real!! it's unbelieveble.. the park, the panorama, the ocean, restaurants, music... if you are in LA you must see it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gianlucabE8070IB
30,I don't know what the hype is about,"What is the hype of this place? Other than the fair grounds their isn't much to this pier. The Route-66 shop is about the only thing worth seeing as the shop has money from around the world post on the walls and ceiling. The souvenirs for route-66 are a cool. On the peir there are annoying people playing American Idol flop-out music trying to earn a buck or two spoiling the beautiful sound of the ocean and nature.If you want a better beach and more natural setting, I recommend Huntington (Surf City) south on California 1 (~40 min south of Long Beach).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CndTrvlr042
30,Nice for an hour or so,The pier is nice to look around for an hour or so with a stroll to Venice beach but that’s about it. Rides and games too expensive to play. The best thing is the shops and restaurants in Santa Monica itself. Great bargains and designs on offer and lots lots of restaurants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fisher1962
30,West Coast Coney Island,"The pier is good for rides and arcade games. It’s very busy and crowded. There are some eateries on the boardwalk. It’s good to do one time but unless you’re going on the rides again,once is enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/she31
40,Loads to see and do,"Great experience! A must do if in Santa Monica or area. Loads of shops, eateries, amusement park. The games remind of the state fair at home. One can simply browse alongside the water like me or soak up the sun on the beach. It was within a short walking distance from our hotel. This could be an all day affair with the pier being the destination. I highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/490elsiem
50,"Great place to visit , definitely worth staying nearby.",We stayed nearby in the Wyndham and had a great time in this location. We ate at Bubba Gumps which was a pleasant experience with tasty food and good service.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Notsotouchy
50,really nice visit,parked at the pier and super easy to access everything . plenty of gift stalls and shops to get what you want as a tourist .quite busy at times but a pleasant feel about the place and lots of choice for food / drink .beaches are all nice with the usual views of endless surf /sand .really like Santa monica,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WalterWhite01
40,Busy pier,We spent the morning here from 8 to noon and watched the pier get very busy by the time we left. The pier is accessible whereby if you have a handicap pass you park for free along with their being elevators at one of the restaurants. The parking is limited though. We didn't get a chance to get there at night to see the lights which are supposed to be really nice. The cost for someone to write you name in animal letters is $1/letter plus a mat for the artwork. Coffee and food is reasonably priced. All n all it was a fun time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/24shawnd
50,Make It Funky,Best free entertainment. We tipped the guy in the sparkly white jacket who sang Make It Funky because he totally made our day. Oh and there is a contact high at most times.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moonchuckersmom

30,People Watching Extravaganza,"If you like people watching you will get a eye full at the Santa Monica Pier. Crowded as expected, it attracts a lot of visitors from all over the world and provides an endless amount of beautiful views of the Pacific Ocean and the surrounding beaches. Though I never witnessed any issue, be mindful of your personal belongings and be sure to enjoy the street performers....some of them incredibly talented. There is a park at the entrance to the pier that attracts a ""baked"" clientele and lingering nearby will give you a gratuitous high. No worries.....it's fun and crazy...just as you would expect at a seaside attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlanA361

40,Trip to La,Accidentally found it when driving on route 101 north. So excited to see it in the rear view mirror.. it’s strange driving on a wood plant bridge to park the car in the lot. Nice little walking and shopping area. Definitely going to see some strange people but nice to watch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mycrazy7

50,An activity hub.,"We went for a quick stroll on the beach but it’s a Sunday. As expected, there was a ton of people - both locals and out of town tourists. The mood was very festive with a lot of street performers. I will revisit soon but will go on a weekday instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F5032PLterryc
40,Winter Time Weekend,"The pier is great for a walk. But there weren't many shops open when we went through, not sure if it was because it was December? We did get some great pictures though, and hopefully we get to come back when it is more lively.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/golightly1907
40,A must visit in Santa Monica,"You can’t go to Santa Monica without a visit to the pier, expect crowds but it kind of adds to the good general vibe. Lots of stalls for souvenirs that were quite reasonably priced due to all the competition. Probably worth heading into Santa Monica city (not far) for something to eat and a bit of a rest from the crowds, lots of options and healthier choices than at the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lookinoutallover
40,A MUST SEE IN SANTA MONICA,Nothing like a walk on a pier. Right to the ocean and more if you like the fair style and the beach life this is where it is at. Lots of performers as well as music at the pier entrance. On Sundays they pay tribute to all the fallen soldiers on the beach that have given their lives in the last wars.Flags fly everywhere and snack foods fill the pier. Only a few blocks from main attractions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HART6591
40,A nice walk on a cool evening!,Wanted to see the Pacific and the Santa Monica Pier was our choice! The end of Route 66 and a place to put our toes in the Pacific......the breeze was blowing and there were people to watch....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pastorbob_12
30,Just to tick it off the list,Nothing special really. Looks run down and it was just something to tick of the sight seeing list. Looked good at night with the pier lit up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Snakedoctor321983
30,Start/End Route 66,Took a very short trip here to start my Route 66 journey.It was early morning so the pier was pretty much shut. It seems to serve as a great hub for the beach and parking is fair at $13.Plenty to do on the pier and worth a trip for the history of it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DarrenBailes
50,Love love love,"For some reason, Santa Monica always has a great importance for the visitors. Everybody would like to step by around Santa Monica Pier and actually it worths. Feeling the breeze, walking along the way, looking to the ocean and having some fun.. all these are provided by this place. It is so easy to walk, usually there are some personal shows. A lot of place to buy magnets and etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/esrakaratay
30,Nice afternoon,"Was an interesting place to see, more children orientated. It was also cold the day we went. We had fun overall",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kemoores2
40,For Sunset,"Rushed over at about 645pm (sunset was about 725pm), traffic & parking looked to be a nightmare but thankfully we managed to get parking at the pier itself.Headed onto the pier to take photos on the beautiful sunset, of course there were hordes of tourists but you’d be able to get your own sunset photos in peace nonetheless.Great colours & setting for sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/niwdlabc
40,"Vibrant, busy and fun !","We made a very quick dash to the pier during a one night stop-over on the way back from holiday in the South Pacific to the UK. We had both always wanted to come here having seen the pier and surrounding beaches in movies etc., so it was a must do, especially to watch the sunset.The pier itself was packed (Sunday evening), full of people, noisy, vibrant with all sorts of stalls, performers and the like. We come from a seaside area in the UK and likened Santa Monica Pier to piers back home in their heyday...and then some !We were both very tired so we didn't hang around the pier itself for too long, went along the beach a few hundred yards to watch the sunset, but had we been a bit more 'refreshed' I'm sure we would have explored the pier a bit more.Great attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveandCaz44
40,Beautiful view of the sunset,"Stunning Views of the sunset, lots to do & eat. Parking isn't free but there are lots of spaces. Go at the right time & you can watch the sunset when it is less busy on the beachfront or go during the day when it more busy on the sand.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Krisbyman
50,Beautiful ocean view,"On a sunny day, make sure you go to Santa Monica. You will enjoy the view, the weather and the walk. Also, you could have lunch or go shopping. It's the place to go to on a good weather day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/517abrars
50,Epic landmark- a must do in Socal,"This pier has been featured in countless movies, and is an important Southern California landmark. It is where Route 66 ends and the Pacific Ocean begins! There are restaurants, attractions and street performers all waiting to greet you. If you have never visited- this is a must do!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/21parisf
30,"Fun on nice weather days, to people interact and depends on events.","We enjoyed it and there were many events taking place in the area while we were there. Amusement park is fun to watch the people though expensive. Do a ride band? Also plan to pay for parking in the area. Eats on the pier can be pricey, may be best to just get drinks on the pier though they are pricey also. Like anything the pier is what you make it. If like to walk park in the area and walk to the pier and beach areas to enjoy the activities taking place. You can safely walk for miles from the pier. We enjoyed the walking and seeing everyone enjoying the beach area activities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pslot
50,Loved this Place!,Our first time here and we had a Great time. All sorts of things to do on the the pier and a walk on the beach is just steps away!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donnamL1514KX
40,An hour spent at Santa Monica pier,"Easy parking, great Mexican food and beautiful sight! The Ferris Wheel had a amazing view. Walked down to the beach and waded in beautiful place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/salonid123
40,Quick stop at the pier,"Late night stop, maybe a little too late as the park was closing up. It was a peaceful walk to the end of the pier, wondering what the fishermen below are catching. Local musicians and artists set up shop along the way, the fog started to roll in, hauntingly cool. Don’t forget to take a stroll down the beach path toward the water. Bring a jacket, it’s pretty windy and cold but worth the scenery. Get there earlier to enjoy the amusement park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Piiiiiiiiiiza
50,Family Friendly Landmark,"Beautiful beach views, fun boardwalk with family friendly activities, tons of junk food, and touristy vendors. Worth visiting this iconic spot if in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellera131
40,Not wheelchair friendly,"And I clarify. Yes it is accessible, but difficult to navigate. The old wood planks on the pier make it difficult to navigate in a straight line. Bathrooms are ok, with accessible stalls, lots of graffiti. People are friendly. If you park at the beach, their is a public elevator for disabled in bubba hump shrimp company. Lots of street performers as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3255MCsteveb
50,fantastic place with young children,you only need to visit here for a couple of hours unless you want to relax on the amazing beach. we hired bikes but make sure you check out the prices as they vary. we paid 25$ for all day rental. the rental place was very near Shutters hotel. the pier is good old fashioned fun and the beach is fantastic. very clean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dreamer730613
40,Birthday at the pier,"First we ate at Bubba Gumps. The view was amazing but the food was meh. We sat next to this weird druggie guy who talked on his phone the whole time. Ambience! Thankfully they don't charge for that. Next we went on the ferris wheel which was worth the price gouge because the sunset was beautiful. I liked the museum - we learned all sorts of cool stuff. This was a weekday, so tolerable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaraM291
40,Fun to visit!,"Have to go if you are in Santa Monica. Food is not cheap but it is so fun to see! Busy place, full of character! Great view of the water as well. Can't skip in Santa Monica!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Frenchymama
50,Fun day at the pier...,Inexpensive and fun! The Ferris Wheel was our favorite- amazing views. Kids working at the rides had great personalities and made the short wait in line easy to take.Walked down to the beach and waded in- beautiful place!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lichenlover
50,We love ❤️ the pier,Definitely a must on any visit to SM is the iconic pier. We just love the park and rides and pier concerts and all the goodness the Pacific Ocean has to offer!🌈🌟do yourself a favor and go.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/401alexandert
30,"Great if you like crowds, noise and really schlocky souvenirs","We visited about a week ago. The weather was perfect. Not too hot, not too sunny.It was far more crowded than I ever remembered it. Even in the Playland, which used to be one of my favorite places - so crowded with machines and people that there was not even enough elbow room to play the games.Lots of people making music on the Pier. That was actually nice.Not many places to just sit down and visit with friends.Most of the eating places had long lines.The rides looked a bit rickety. And the ferris wheel..well, it didn't move often. So if you got on, expect to stay on it for a long time. That might actually be a good thing if you want a private place to chat, make-out, or propose - and see the sights. The view from up there would be amazing.The food offerings were routine.The souvenir shops? Really, things looked so tacky.The shops on the Venice boardwalk have better looking quality of souvenirs.Incidentally, this is the end of Route 66 - so you will find some of that paraphernalia.A word about parking -Find your way to the Santa Monica city lots.(From Colorado Blvd, turn right).They are much cheaper (but don't accommodate vehicles needing high clearance).We ended up stuck in traffic for so long that we just copped out and parked in the old Sears parking lot for $20. Way too expensive.(20 more feet and we could have turned on to 4th St, if we had known).It's not a long walk to the Pier from that area.Bring your own hat (sun) and lotion.Eat elsewhere.There is much better food directly across the street and on the 3rd Street Promenade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/451evar
40,"Fun morning before the ""busy"" season","The pier is smaller than I imagined, yet still really neat and worth making a special trip to (despite the horrible, awful, snail's pace LA traffic we had to navigate to arrive). We parked on the pier and it didn't cost any more than any of the surrounding parking lots several blocks from the beach- I think it was around $12. We got there in the early morning, so it wasn't crowded and it was early April, too, so we kind of lucked out in the not-too-crowded department. There is a small amusement park on the pier (costs money) and a Bubba Gump's as well as a few other small eateries and some very tacky tourist shops. Watched people fish off of the pier (that aspect is filthy, because the fish guts weren't cleaned up) and enjoyed the wind and views from the end of the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dherbst75
10,Touristy and only quasi-safe.,"Not worth the crowds and idiots milling about trying to make a postcard. Best to avoid. Lots of sketchy characters hanging around also, selling drugs, having gang meet-ups, etc. look from afar but otherwise no need to bother.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crrnyc2014
50,Best beach after Miami South Beach,If you don't care about going in the water ( which you should not plan on cause is super cold) this is a great beach.. something to do for everyone. Highly recommended to take a bike and ride to Venice beach and back. Stroll on the pier or take advantage of amazing shopping and high end dining on 3rdStreet .. the best experience in LA hands down. Parking could be hectic so use spot hero if possible. Get a sweet treat from Carlos bakery if you have a sweet tooth.. not cheap but delicious .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mihais55
30,Extremely busy,We caught the train to Santa Monica and then the big blue bus down to Venice beach and walked back up to Santa Monica Pier. It was a lovely sunny day and an enjoyable walk the pier itself is extremely busy and just bursting with people. Glad we went but would not bother again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TKP1325
50,Great adventure with small to mid sized kids,"This is a very small but good amusement park and arcade on a pier next to/ over the ocean. Roller coasters and other attractions are good for beginners and for a fun family time. Parking is easy unless you are there mid-summer, in which case its quite crowded. If your kids like rides, get the wristbands, the individual tickets go too fast. The best part is that members of your party that don't want to get on the rides do not have to pay which is very different from big theme parks. This is a great place to visit for the day or after the beach for a couple of hours. Our family goes here frequently.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/622gregk
50,Route 66 End if trail,"What a great way to finish our Route 66 adventure. A lovely bustling cool vibe about the place. Loads of street performers, great food, I could spend more time here. The guy in the Route 66 cabin was a legend and made us feel super welcome an all round nice guy.I highly recommend a visit here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TopLoader
50,Fun environment,"We strolled to the end of the Pier, watched/listened to the vendors. Had lunch at Bubba Gumps (excellent food!), Sat on benches soaking up the sights and sounds. Fun to experience!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happytraveler1058
40,Get there early for great pics!,"I read some lukewarm reviews on the pier, I believe the pier was one of the highlights of my brief escapade from LA. The key is to get there early, I was there by 8 AM and was able to enjoy the area and take great pics before the mob came.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Egamd98
40,End of Route 66,"This was our final stop on a Route 66 road trip from Chicago to LA.Classic seaside pier with amusements. Not as good as some of the British piers like Blackpool or Southport but still worth a wander around.The pier marks the end of Route 66, so it’s an absolute must for anyone travelling the Mother Road.Parking on and around the pier is easy to find. We went for a walk from the pier along Santa Monica Beach all the way to Venice Beach and back. Easy walking and lots of people to watch!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/202neilb
40,"Worth a walk, but Santa Monica itself was the place to go","You have to walk the pier, it’s part of going there, but the city itself was the most enjoyable part of the day. We were there early and parked by the beach . I thought the parking cost was reasonable. Google Maps got us there from universal and it was an easy drive",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fiftytoes
50,Fun afternoon /evening,"Beautiful place , gets a bit chilly in the evening take a jacket , kids loved it , few places to eat , great pics at sunset , kids loved the roller coaster .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melissayres
40,Great to Pass the Evening with a View,"Simply riding a ferris wheel is one thing, standing on a pier another, but do both with a sunset view in a cool ocean breeze where everyone is happy -- that's fun. A few good rides, a selection of food booths, and lots of t-shirt shops, etc. Touristy? Yes. Worth it. Absolutely!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davebob123
50,Clean and fun,"Lots of cool shops, was cleaner than other piers I've been to in California. Wouldn't hesitate to return. Stopped at the restaurant on the end for dinner but the wait was 25 mins so we went elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mike4king
40,Pier was very unique👍🇺🇸,"I really enjoyed walking around and seeing all the different people, venders and musicians. It is a very unique experience and Pier. Avery popular photo shoot for visitors, TV and Movies 🎥 over the years. I really enjoyed my time there.👍🇺🇸",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jumpinjohnny1903
40,Easter weekend trip,"Nice stroll on the pier the day before Easter. Plenty of people watching, tourist shopping, and picture extraveganza. They offer local talent and amusement rides, and local restaurants. A little something for everyone. Easy access to the beach for a stroll or dip in the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisaa106
30,"Tourist everywhere, great people watching",Tourist trap with plenty of cheesy souvenirs. Chain restaurants with average food and service. Great view of the ocean and nice to walk around but I wouldn't spend more that an hour maybe 2 at this location.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelacI4434TR
40,Busy on Wednesday,"Another Sunny but breezy California busy afternoon. Street players line the boardwalk. Took a $10 per, on the iconic ferris wheel just because. We sat across from each other to balance, tried to slide to get a couple selfies and LOL the car started to rock, so not being a thrill sealer stayed put. The boardwalk is fun and lively. Two resturants also on the boardwalk, parked right off the boardwalk. Plus this is the Western end of Route 66, so get you're kicks on 66.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MMandSM
50,love it,"Good for families with small kids or teen, a lot of fan, many activities. I recomend rent a car o a bike and go to another beach near, all are very nice",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeliEli
30,So crowded,"We walked the pier on a Sunday afternoon. Great place for people watching, but not the place to go for a peaceful walk. Lots of musicians every few feet on the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fivemarions
30,Disappointing visit to pier,We were disappointed in our visit. The boardwalk was not well kept up and there were so many homeless people lining the vacant bridges and entrance to the boardwalk. Very sad.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/317MC
40,Great for kids,"Just your average pier with rides and food, worth a visit but only spent maybe 20 mins on the pier then headed to the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skphillipsss
50,Great place to come on a nice day,"The weather wasn't great when we came so only spent a couple of hours here. But there's a lot to see and do, and there is a Bubba Gump Shrimp which is always good!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F962BBdanielb
30,Overrated,"Something to see in life but not so amazing how they says. I visited it in the morning, maybe at night is nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucacaps
40,Good to visit,"The day we visited was a sunny one with only a light wind and the temperature was not high enough to warrant a swim in the ocean, but there were people swimming.As you enter the pier under the big sign, there are many people performing for money.Besides the permanent shops, there are many other people with pop up stands, or no stands, trying to sell you something.Walking the length of the pier you will pass the amusement park, the end of route 66 sign, and old style penny arcade and many more attractions.It is a good place to visit, but there is no need to spend a lot of time here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleymG9693GJ
40,Walk on Pier,"If its for fishing, buying souvenirs or just to relax and enjoy sea-breeze this is one of my faves spot to visit when in California!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denistoza_otracosa
50,A Must See Landmark!,"I have been visiting this pier for 30+ years and have seen many transitions as the area waned and grew. It is definitely on an upswing and well worth visiting! The pier has many little gift shops, snack stands, and a restaurant or two. The amusement rides are fun, but the best value is in riding the famous carousel for only $1.00 and getting an ice cream cone right in the same building at their old fashioned ice cream counter. You can walk down to the beach right behind the carousel building and play on the well-known rings and monkey bars, rent a bike or scooter, or venture to the shore line for some toe-dipping fun! Just be aware of your surroundings as there is still a noticeable presence of homeless people milling about and if the pier parking is full, drive two blocks towards the shopping center (around 2nd/Broadway) and pay nothing for the first 90 minutes and a dollar or so for each hour afterwards.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Christine_BB4U
30,Very Crowded,"Went here because it’s so iconic. Finding parking was not difficult. Plenty to see and do on the pier.Performers playing music, little shops to buy your memory trinkets.Ice cream was great on a warm sunny day.Must visit at least once, not sure if more times is necessary though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SergeGTS
40,Entertaining,Santa Monica Pier is an interesting place to visit for a look around or if you want to enjoy the rides and fair ground activities. Photo shoot spot ouside Bubba Gumps if you want to be Forest Gump for a minute or 2. Plenty of food outlets. Can stay for hours or just wander through and enjoy the atmosphere,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OzTrippa
30,Blah,"Great to people watch, but mostly gimmick and touristy. Great view of the beach. Clean bathrooms, parking is expensive",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikeoT7667LA
40,Good all in package for kids,Kids can ride all attractions as often as they want for just 18 Usd. Great selection but count in some wait times.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robbster2016
30,Day at the beach,"A mission to get there from LA city, takes over an hour as traffic horrendous! Beach nice but had to pay $70 for 2 sun beds & a parasol & that was the rate whether it was a few hours, half a day or more! Pier very tacky a bit like Brighton, to be avoided.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jen581
40,Santa Monica Pier | Old fashioned fun,"I wasn’t sure what to expect of Santa Monica Pier it doesn’t have the same polish as some of the other piers but it has an old school charm about it. The Pier was crowded on the day we visited but I like hustle and bustle so that wasn’t an issue, though you are very conscious to keep your bag close to you. Everything was reasonably priced and the queues weren’t too bad especially given that we went during spring break.The highlight for my children aged 6yrs and 8yrs old were the vintage arcade games which they thought were hilarious (but where are all the colours Mum?).If you are there in the evening you must take a quick walk on the beach to get a phot of the Ferris wheel lit up it’s beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LiannaS539
30,Super Busy.,"I suppose people want to see this because it’s popular, but it’s not worth it. Try manhattan beach. It’s less crowded and has an all around better vibe. Still cool to see this though if you haven’t before.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abbyness67
40,Great Afternoon Destination,"We stayed in Santa Monica for one night to rest after landing at LAX from Australia. We're glad we did as the pier was a few minutes walk away and is open every day.There's lots to look at if you don't want to spend much - buskers, the views, etc - and of course heaps of rides and activities if you so desire.The afternoon gets very busy to an uncomfortable level so we made it a quick trip, but we ducked down again the next morning right on opening and it was quite pleasant. No bumping shoulders, no waits for rides so the kids were far happier.And the morning sees empty beaches so you can always go down the stairs directly to the beach for a stroll.The ride tickets are bought from a ticket booth, the line moves quite quickly.There's a few eating places here, but you can always walk a few hundred metres back to the mainland for other eats.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/collo75
40,Locals and tourists mixing it up,"It has everything you would expect on a pier - rides, shopping, lots of fried foods (a couple of nice seafood restaurants (not Bubba Gumps...), and a great view. Seemingly never ending wide beaches and plenty of activity (biking, boarding and walking). A definite stop as you make your way up or down the coast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/James_Hytner
50,This place omits joy!,Walking along the beach and on the pier made me so happy! It was busy but organized and well kept. It’s a beautiful backdrop to every photo!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IYamwhatiyam2014
50,Family fun without the kids,"NOTE: TYPE OF VISIT: FAMILY NO KIDS(This wasn't option, so I had to mark 'friends').Eight adults without children had a blast here! Unless you count those of us who acted like a kid again. This place brings out the kid in, no matter how old you are. The sun was out and the weather was perfect.So many vendors on the boardwalk and lots of singers. With hundreds of people on the beach and pier, the coast guard and police helicopters kept busy flying over. We paid the $10 per person to ride the ferris wheel. (It's not as large as the one back home in Washington state, but still fun). We even saw two seals near the fishermen off the lower dock. After spending over 5 hours on the boardwalk / pier, we where too tired to walk on the boardwalk down on the beach. Maybe next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BurienTraveler2014
40,LA icon,"Arrived at Santa Monica Pier late back from Santa Barbara. Parking was a little confusing to find. Lucky parking wasn't too bad. Got a spot easily. However still paid even it was at night.The Pier was still packed with people and selling stalls. All the fun rides and restaurants were still open. As we already had had dinner before, we didn't experience any restaurants there. But the one at the beginning of the Pier looked good.One thing I didn't like was the small stalls (hawkers) on the pier. It's just not nice to see.I recommend to go there early, maybe have a swim in the ocean too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jason526
40,A Fun Place,"It is at the end of Route 66 and also a fun place with amusements, rides, food and numerous characters. In some ways it makes you feel a bit like you are in Key West, with the characters present. We arrived in a motor home and parking was $58, but admission to the boardwalk and beach is free, which reduces the pain of parking. Car parking is much cheaper.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lecano_FlStan43
50,A lot to see & do,"A fun place for the whole family. Parking is available. Shops, music & a few rides.Definitely check out the sunset while here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Teenie2000
30,SUCH AN ICONIC PLACE,"I wish we could have gotten there at a different time. We arrived late in the day. Parking was fine once we figured out exactly where to go. The big parking lot was the best choice but we weren’t sure exactly how to get there and ended up in a jam packed smaller lot that had no spots and hard to get out of. Since we had spent our day in Malibu seeing Pepperdine, we were pretty tired when we got there so we really didn’t get the full feel of this iconic place. So, my opinion is to go earlier in the day and really try to enjoy all it has to offer. I’m only giving it 3 stars because we really didn’t get to experience it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/409dalem
40,famous place!!,Santa Monica Pier is very famous sightseeing spot. At night is very beautiful! And beach can be so relaxing!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yy_uu-uu_tt_aa
20,Didn’t live up to expectations,"For years I have wanted to visit the Santa Monica Pier. We finally decided to visit, and I was sadly disappointed. First off traffic and parking was a nightmare. I missed the city lots and ended up paying $40 for “public parking” off of Ocean Ave and Colorado Ave. The pier was very congested. We stopped at Pacific Park to ride the Ferris wheel. It was $10 each to ride. The staff was very nice. The ride was lackluster. I’m considered petite at only 5’3”, my view from the seat was poor. The cabin was well constructed, I felt very protected and secure, but there was no thrill. We walked all the way to the end of the pier, the views were great. Walking back to the car was a challenge for my husband who has mobility issues. The pier is very steep, and there are no provisions for disabled people, as far as I could see. I was hoping for an elevator, but there was none I did find a switchback walkway off of Appian Way. Overall, we chalked it up to been there done that, wouldn’t do it again.TIPS: Look for parking off Pacific Coast Highway, not Ocean Ave. If you have mobility issues, park on the pier and show your handicap sticker. If you plan to go on more than one ride, buy a pass, it's much cheaper and to save more buy them online.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/369maryannm
40,"Great to visit, is what it is though....","Great to visit, really quirky amusements and entertainment, worth a walk up and down the pier for sure! Looks great at night all lit up!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LouisVaf
40,Just beautiful,"Came on a loverly Autumn day where it wasn’t too hot and not too cold. A fantastic walk along the beach to the pier, great photo opportunities and nice people.I thought that parking was going to be a nightmare and when I arrived to find 2 lots closed due to refurbishment my anxiety rose even more. But if you continue along past the pier (coming from Malibu) there is a HUGE parking lot with a flat rate of $10! Perfect. It’s about a 10 minute walk back to the pier, but like I said, what a great walk!We also had lunch at Bubba Gumps which was brilliant!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sifterboy
50,Very cool place!,"This was a great place to view the ocean, shop, and eat. Musicians are all over singing and playing interesting instruments. Great prices on souvenirs and beach wear. Their are activities for the kids to do but we were just a couple on a trip this time. We ate at Pier Burger. It was good.It was very windy that day (wind gusts up to 30 mph) so we didn't stay long. It was cold. Everyone was friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyaB906

40,Good Time for Anyone,"We spent the entire afternoon and most of the morning here. We had 2, 3 1/2 year olds and there is plenty to do for everyone. We got them the wristbands to ride the rides and they had a blast. There are plenty of nice rides for this age group and picnic tables if you want to pack a lunch, which we did. There are also several food options and restrooms available. We also rode the ferris wheel and had a lovely time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorimT1147VJ
50,Fun Night!!,We went here after dinner to have a fun last night in LA and it was the best time. The Ferris wheel is amazing. You really don’t realize how high up it goes until your there. The rides are awesome because there’s some stuff for adults and some for children. Must go place!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thesarahbella
40,Great spot for people watching,"The iconic Santa Monica pier is a great spot for Some people watching, walking around, great ocean views and photography.It’s conveniently located and easy to get to from most spots in town.It’s Visitors are of all ages.The rides are fun, but not a must.If in town the pier should be visited",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YogiJCC

There were several other artists there and tasty snacks. I had a great time with my family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missjoyelle
40,Gotta go walk the Pier,"We were staying at a nearby hotel, so headed out to walk the pier several times. It really is a fun atmosphere and we felt totally safe the whole time we were there. For a treat walk ALL the way down the pier to the Mexican restaurant, it's way out on the end and is really good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thereKarengoes
50,Fun afternoon/evening with children,My children really enjoyed the pier and the rides it is quite expensive therefore it is important to allow enough time to use the full day pass.Although it was a chilly afternoon/evening it was really busy. It is a must do and the views are great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trusha2016
30,VERY NICE,"The ear is the organ of hearing and, in mammals, balance. In mammals, the ear is usually described as having three parts—the outer ear, middle ear and the inner ear. The outer ear consists of the pinna and the ear canal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theresamay2018
30,Fun for the kids - especially at night,"The kids enjoyed the rides and the views. It's expensive to ride, so plan to spend a couple of hours and get the day pass if you have the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliarY2562MS
40,Fun afternoon out,"Even though it was a cooler day for LA, it was still packed out here, so definitely be prepared to be dealing with a crowd, especially if it's a fine summer's day.The views are beautiful and there are plenty of places to stop off for photos. You can see right back along Santa Monica and Venice Beach.The iconic Pacific Park with ferris wheel and roller coasters is about halfway down the pier. There is no admission fee, so you can come and go as you please, and you can either pay per ride, or pick up an unlimited ride wristband depending how badly you want to go on everything. This is great if you're just after a trip up the ferris wheel. There is a discount for buying online in advance.There are plenty of souvenir shops out on the pier, with clothing, knick-knacks and all the usual fare. A couple of my favourite spots were actually the little carts that were parked along the pier, the souvenirs were a little more unique and there were even a few US made things to pick up. I grabbed these magnets to add to the fridge collection.There are cafes, restaurants, and bars out on the pier, from something for a full meal at The Albright or Bubba Gump Shrimp, or snacks and coffee at the Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xoxAJTxox
50,Crowded,"Very crowded today. Which was surprising because the weather was so cold. But we still enjoyed our family outing. You may even run into a celebrity or two while you’re there. Lots to do and see. Many restaurants to choose from. Parking is a nightmare, so get down there before the crowd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JustAretha

30,Just another pier,Admittedly we went in the morning when t was closed so we couldn’t really pick up the vibe of the place but it looks like your typical travelling rides except for the large roller coaster. The pier is nice for a walk though. Parking at the pier will set you back around $14.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Didge432
50,Fun place and it tacky,One climbs up and down the fairly steep bridge to cross the beach road. But it is worth it. The pier is not particularly long but it has a wide central wooden promenade that allows for fairly spaced musicians and the usual stands. The overall effect is not tacky and that is part of its charm.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidG897
50,Great spot,The heart of Santa Monica. Very nice place to visit. Much much busier on the weekends.Lots of little place to eat or have a drink along the way.Love watching the kites,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karini72
40,A lot of fun.,It was A lot of fun. Lots of street performers and the little theme park. The good however is pretty overpriced and not tasty. The ice cream I had there was probably the worst I've ever had. The churros were good though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrittneyLikeSpears

40,Worth a visit,"I had no idea that the Santa Monica Pier was such a tourist attraction but found it was really worth a visit. Buskers, stalls and rides were interesting to see and a lovely view of the beach and hills. We also had a nice lunch and there are plenty of options for food depending on your taste and budget.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X4999ISsuew
40,"Ice, but closed at 8.30pm!",Lovely to visit. Parking was $14 and you needed cash and the pier closed at 8.30pm (Thursday night) so get there early.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kirrilyb2018
30,Fun to walk down but not worth staying,"If you’re into over-priced crappy food then enjoy! Otherwise, come and have a look and the Ferris wheel and stand above the Pacific Ocean and take in the sea breeze. Then leave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scunder
10,Too crowded,Don't bother...too touristy and difficult to make your way to the pier.... all selling the same crap.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulad866
40,Great for people watching.,The restaurant at the end of the pier offers some fabulous vistas of the ocean and Pacific Palisades while being close enough to the shops and attractions that the pier boasts. Try and spot wild sea lions on the west side of the pier!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vtextc
50,Great vibe,Visited Santa Monica recently the pier was a must very vibrant full of interesting stalls musicians and planes to eat. It's old with wooden wallkboards giant Ferris wheels rides for the kids and something for everyone and it's free to go,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosewarr1106

50,Nice beach. Good restaurants. Small theme park for kids.,"It's a good place for a stroll on the beach side, there are some good restaurants around with a variety of cuisine to choose from. There are many paid rides for kids to enjoy at the small theme park too. I saw a few people with fishing rods near the pier. The beach is nice and clean and perfect to spend a sunny afternoon or partying at the clubs around from evening. Avoid going there if its raining, a lot of small puddles come up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/767abhishekd
50,"Great beach, dining, shopping and fun on the pier",A lovely beach great for photos at sunset. Good shopping and dining across the road. We had a great Mexican meal at Red Os - they have a happy hour between 5 and 6. The pier fun fair is expensive but we enjoyed the $10 Ferris wheel ride. We used Uber to get there which saves the hassles of parking there. Traffic can be busy weekend evenings even after 9 pm.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidDB60
40,Neat place to see & visit!,Lines were quite long for the rides--but it was over Spring Break!Mexican restaurant at the end of the pier had great service & fabulous margaritas!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichelleFerguson1023

50,great place,"It's hard to describe what is really special about Santa Monica Pier and the beach next to it. I have been to better piers and I have been to better beaches but every time I visit Los Angeles (I lived there a long time ago) I feel a need to go down to the pier to see if those fried clam sandwiches are still available, have one of those not so great but cold lemonades. Walk all the way to the end and then make it down to the beach, take off my shoes and dig my toes in the sand. I am often introducing someone new to the scene and they always seem to love it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kerryr50
30,Meh,Pier was just ok. Nice to see it and walk on it but overrated in my opinion. Heavy crowds and commotion. Beach was nice though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Swtlisa19

10,Disgusting and filthy,"Boy, did I get a look at our tax dollars at work!!! 😳😫 The beach sand is FULL of bandaids, cigarette butts, plus every other human filth u could think up!My daughter nearly stepped in pile of human feces on sidewalk. 😲Numerous homeless probably needing more than beach front stroll.Disappointed & disgusted.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cappie7

30,A Tourist Place. Good Photos Though,"Tourist place. Don't expect wonders. However, it's a decent place for photos and to soak up the atmosphere. Some great singers busking there. So do check them out.Rides should be fun for kids though.Tip: Parking is ridiculous at the Pier! 14 bucks per entry! Go park at 2nd Street. Stayed for 3.5 hours for 4.9 USD. (You get free 1.5 hour and it's a 5 min walk away)You are welcome!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Heinzerberg
30,Disappointing,I can’t imagine how a touristic is not prepared for an electricity outage. The theme park had to issue refunds to all visitors and the restaurants stopped serving people. So we had to leave,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noonesg
40,Great place,Had fun here with friendsGot to see the skaters on the beach; just like you see I'm the movies.Great day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/108beckys

50,End of route 66! What a fun day!,"We came here not really knowing what to expect but what a fun day we had. Rode the Ferris Wheel and walked the entire length of the pier. We came early in the morning (around 9:30 - 10) and what a perfect time. It wasn't super busy. Not at all crowded. So many things to see. Lots of vendors, buskers. (One really strange guy that sings and dances. He was hilarious and really fun to watch.) Bought a few Route 66 souvenirs (of course!). Also rented some Bird scooters. What fun they were. You just download the app on your phone and find one that is available to rent. They aren't crazy expensive and we had a blast on them. It was hard to find 2 that didn't have dead batteries. But once we did we went up and down the bike path a few times. All the way to Venus Beach! For an activity we didn't really plan to do it was one of the highlights of our trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nkelln

40,Fun day at the beach,"We were in LA in early April so going to the pier with rides and activities for the kids was perfect because it was too cold to fully go swimming. My son had fun walking the pier, we ate, rode a few rides, and put our feet in the water on the beach. There's a place on the pier that rents umbrellas and chairs pretty cheaply so you don't have to bring a bunch of gear if you want to hang out on the sand. It was a fun day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DJ-Reviewer-One-Day
50,The end of Route 66 !!,We had a few hours to spend going up the PCH and wanted to visit the Santa Monica Pier !! It was nice and cozy and there were beaches all around.

40,A classic pier boardwalk,"Went here with my 12 and 16 year old daughters. We rode a couple rides and enjoyed people watching at the pier. Only downside was that rides were quite pricey, $10 for a roller coaster that wasn’t that big or that long of a ride for example. After that we walked on the beach a bit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynn_from_WI
50,Beautiful Santa Monica,"Enjoyed walking around Santa Monica and the pier. It's absolutely beautiful around this area. We got there first thing in the morning, so found parking very easily and got to walk around the pier & the area before the crowds came.

50,An upscale version of Coney Island,"This place was nice to visit. A family oriented place, lots to do, very casual and laidback, easy going, great ocean views, and great ice cream and funnel cake. For those of us from the Northeast U.S., it may remind you of Coney Island, but more upscale. Walk across to the promenade on Third Street. It’s an upscale shopping street, pedestrian only. It’s like Lincoln Road in Miami’s South Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HolliwdLadybug
40,Santa Monica Outing,"Santa Monica Pier is a place to come and visit whilst visiting in Los Angeles. Plus being of historical interest too. Walked along the whole length of it. Was very busy the day I went. Enjoyed the walk along it and to be able to see what it had to offer. There was a small amusement park on the pier too which I did not go into but interesting to see. A must see, plus to see where Route 66 starts from.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinebU9253EF
40,Fun Day At The Pier,"The pier is like going to a carnival or fair for the day. It can get pretty pricey if you want to play arcade games. There is a restaurant at the end of the pier but I don't suggest it. It's over priced and there is much better food in Santa Monica.Tip: Get there earlier when it opens at 11am and it's not bad. By 2 in the afternoon, it was getting really busy.Parking tip: There is a $5/day lot on weekends about 2 blocks away on Main Street. You can cut through Tongva Park which is a really cute/cool park that also has public bathrooms you can hit on your way in and as you leave. It's cheaper and allows you to avoid the busy traffic on Ocean. I think that same lot has a $14/day cap on weekdays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YOLO720
50,Enjoy about Santa Monica Pier,"You have to visit Santa Monica Pier. It's an amazing place to chill in and relax. I recommend the restaurants there are around this Area.

40,Classic carousel on the pier at Santa Monica,"Who can resist a carousel? The Santa Monica Pier has beautiful completely restored and revitalized carousel. The detail in the painting of the horses, carriages, walls is beautify. On the wall there are posters explaining the history of the ride and details on what it took to renovate. Price to ride is nominal, but the genuine fun of the ride is special. Don't miss it if you are in the neighborhood. Also of interest to our party was the airplane ride. Round and round, up and down. Fun for the 3 year old.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrmachine

40,Neat place to visit but not if you’re using mobility equipment.,"Left the teens behind at the travel trailer and decided to check out the Santa Monica Pier.First challenge was maneuvering my knee scooter down the ramp and then onto the pier made of boards. Nope, it didn’t occur to me that the pier would be a boardwalk and I know better! So, the use of a knee scooter was a major challenge because of the knots and gaps in the wood boards but I managed to make it to the end.Several street performers were available to listen to while each one sang or played their music. One guy would artistically write whatever name you wanted and create a large name card. Several overpriced gift shops, rides, and other stuff. The most fascinating thing to me was the colorful Ferris wheel and all its LED lighting and ever changing designs.We visited after 8pm but there were still a lot of people there. This pier would be a great place to visit if you wanted to chill out and people watch and listen to the performers.Gotta visit at least once! Next time we’ll come by during the day when it’s light out. And when my sprained ankle is fully healed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/delpuertoRS

30,Good place for the family,Great place to visit for a family outing. Great place to take pictures while also a thrilling experience. It get's very crowded with guests so I would recommend if coming from recent flight to leave personal belongings at residency. The Santa Monica Pier aquarium right below the carousel is also a great place to check out when at the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/926kaylag

40,Fun time,"This is just a place you have to visit if you are in the area. It just feels nostalgic. The street performers have designated spaces and some are better than others of course. The day we visited there was a fantastic magician on the pier that we really enjoyed. There are rides, but we didn’t ride. It was just a fun little outing. We ate at the Mexican restaurant at the end of the pier and the food was great. You could tell it would really be a fun spot on a warm night. Unfortunately we were there on a gloomy cool morning. It felt like a safe place to be with plenty of parking. I wouldn’t plan on spending a whole day there, but definitely worth the effort to get there for the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rene20
40,Iconic,My sons had never been. A visit to LA is hardly complete if you don't walk the pier. People watching is fun. My youngest ride the small roller coaster. My wife took pictures of all the hustle and bustle. My eldest took selfies to show his friends. It is what it is and it's never boring!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johncalvinwisdom

40,"A Worthwhile Visit, except Parking Costs $$$","Parking around the Santa Monica Pier costs a lot and most parking lots close at 7pm. We wanted to watch the sunset and the Ferris Wheel light up, so we ended up paying USD$25 for ""all-day"" parking. It was crowded all along the boardwalk. Several unlicensed vendors, ""churro ladies"" were calling out from the bridge to the pier, selling churros at USD$1 compared to the much higher prices at licensed carts on the pier. Many street performers, artists & food vendors line the boardwalk, making it a very interesting walk. A diversity of people were fishing by the rails. They have the convenience of benches to rest on, fish-cleaning facilities, and multi-level, wheelchair accessible balconies to fish from. There's even a small bait & tackle shop at the end of the pier run by very experienced anglers. I love that a visit to the Santa Monica Pier can cost as little or as much as the visitor wants to spend: from just USD$6 for parking before 7pm to spending on carousel rides, spending at the arcade, spending on trapeze school, spending on amusement park rides and games in Pacific Park, and of course, on food!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bargain
50,Vacation,It was a great trip! I’m glad we rented bikes it was worth it :) the weather was good. Traffic is a joke better to leave after 8 or 9 am or 7-9 pm avoid during the day it’s bumper to number 🚗 🚙😡,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moltavui

50,Fun seaside atmosphere!,"Got to spend a great couple of hours at Santa Monica Pier last month. Weather was perfect for March! We didn’t go on any rides, instead enjoyed the stalls and entertainers spread out along the pier. Good selection of places to eat as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sarahinoz72
40,A nice day out although very crowded,"It was a nice day out and a good experience , there was city WiFi on there if that interests anyone. The were lots of food places and an amazing hotdog cart just on the pier (Japadog) not to expensive either, would recommend highly. There were few shops and other things to do and views were amazing off the pier in you could see seals and sea lions swimming if your lucky. Some great entertainment at the end with a superb drummer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/378karlr
40,"Very cool to see in person, but probably only need to see once",The Santa Monica Pier is very cool to see. Pictures come out very nice. We were there before sundown. Mostly tourists. It was busy. The beach is nice. Fun to play on all of the rings and swings. We ate at the Albright and it was really good. Had the Mahi Mahi tacos. They had some street vendors and little shops. Had fun and took a lot of pictures. Don’t think night time would be very safe to be there though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebeccarI5208LZ
50,Showcase stop with out of towners..........................,"Found parking easy in near by city garage........we walked onto pier with lights blazing on Pier sign, Ferris wheel, merry-go-round and many folks strolling and enjoying the evening.Great range of food options, attractions, etc. Walk to end of Pier and check out fishing experts. Excellent people watching location....................",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FranChasen
40,A buzzing place!,"I am sure this pier is an amazing place to hang in the evenings. We visited in the morning and there were really only life around 10 am, but an must visit with great walks, interesting people and nice restaurants and street vendors. Beautiful view and touristy feel. A must visit when you are around Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swazijumbo
30,An iconic location that has seen better days?,"While in the area, it was recommended we visit this location. Locating on-street metered parking for $2/hr was a good move as the public parking ranged from $15 - $20. Walking along the scenic Palisades Park just north of the pier provided a great view of the beautiful beaches, the ocean and the pier. We walked to the entrance ramp that leads directly down to the pier. This was quite steep for approx. 1/4 mile. I imagine this might be an issue for those with walking restrictions that might want to make use of a drop off location at the entrance to the pier at the bottom of the hill and before the paid parking lot. If you have never been to an ocean amusement pier or boardwalk before you may find this a very exciting and different location. If you are from the Jersey shore, the coast of Maine or Connecticut where boardwalks and piers are common and filled with seasonal fun you may not find this to be worth the visit. Many traditional rides, traditional food offerings, t - shirt and novelty vendors abound. If you walk all the way out to the end of the pier you will see a lower level that is used by folks fishing off of the pier. A large, multi - level restaurant anchors the end of the pier but it was too early for us to take in a meal. I will say the end of the pier facing back to the beaches make great photos as evidenced by the incredible number of people using selfie -sticks to be part of the photos. It did appear that a large number of deck boards had been replaced recently and there is a small but informative history of the pier dating back to 1914. Additionally we learned this was the end ( or beginning) of the orginal Route 66 from Chicago to LA. We enjoyed the walk through and then proceed up to 3rd Ave Promenade , about two blocks from the pier, for some shopping and people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jerseybob175
30,"Fun place to go, no too special though","I didn't have much time in LA, and we're not fans of Hollywood stuff, so we figured Santa Monica should work. It was enjoyable overall, but didn't make me love LA, it's pretty average and very similar to attractions I've seen in other cities. Some street performers, a lovely sunset, a beach (chilly in March though), some cheap rides and a few unattractive cafes. The souvenir shops don't have anything interesting to offer, although I would have loved a souvenir from LA, couldn't find anything worthy, just regular touristy stuff. If you only have one day in LA, I don't recommend this place. If you have more days and the weather is good, then maybe you will enjoy Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YuliaGR
40,Nice break from the beach,"Very clean, few different arcades and restaurants including bubba gump. Local entertainers along the pier who were very good. Route 66 sign on the pier for pictures. Good views of the beaches and fun fair. Lovely break from the beach. Would happily go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GemsyLou89

40,Evening visit to the Pier,"Not a lot going on here, it was okay to visit but not really that great of an attraction. Some old rides which are not cheap and a few vendors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/855conniep
40,Nice crowded place,Nice crowded place with lots of activities and food diversity. Not enough courage to have fruits from street sellers though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgianap299
10,Carpark and amusement park,"Went to Santa Monica pier in order to see the iconic pier, but found myself on the pier sorrounded by cars and a roller coster. Why is anything beautiful spoiled by the american urge to squeeze the last dollar out of the tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/798perr
20,Dirty,Not sure what the hype is. Place is filthy. Places to eat were even filthy. Santa Monica needs to clean the place up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/topit7
40,More fun than I would have expected,Went here twice during a recent trip to Santa Monica and LA. The weather was spectacular. Kids enjoyed the arcade and the games were in decent shape. Ride the West Coaster roller coaster. It’s very tame but you get amazing views from the top and you get two rides for the price of one ticket. The souvenir shops have typical stuff in them but surprisingly were not overpriced. Parking there is tough. We walked from the hotel.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sakman73
40,Old Style Funfair,Our two grand-daughters (2 and 4) loved all of their rides. Particularly good that we could call an Uber right onto the Pier to take them home.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/malcolmb161
30,Tired place but great for people watching,"On a very busy Saturday, we checked this out and it about met our expectations, which were pretty low. Great people watching but the whole thing was a bit tired.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jefff727
30,kiwis in LA,Certainly the nicer part of LA. The pier is exactly as you see it on tV but is really aimed at children with the types of rides it has. not a lot of quality food options here either.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alanab696
40,Nice at Sunset,"I brought friends from out of town here and we walked the path to Venice Beach and back. Even though it was a rare, overcast and at time rainy day. The lit up Ferris wheel makes a good instagrammable moment. Good variety of restaurants in the general area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Danjiro
40,Amazing Sunset view,It gets really crowded so finding a place to sit down with a blanket is a little hard but the views are really amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/divya92

30,Day trip,"Well maintained pier worth a stroll down, doesn’t cost anything to get on the pier but rides you have to pay for which is normal, if in Santa Monica it would be rude not to go and see",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lilkentkitchen123
30,"Crowded, carni-atmosphere","Hoping to capture some of the nostalgia, the seedy nature of the scene is a bit overwhelming. It is what it is, but classing up the area a bit could do it a lot of good. It's a tourist trap, but it needs to hold on tighter to its history to warrant a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/217kerris
40,Kids loved it!!,Kids attrations + Sun + Beach = Kids Fun! This is the ingredients to have one amazing day in Santa Monica Pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RMPD
50,A Los Angeles classic,"We recently moved to Los Angeles, so we’ve been trying to get to know our new home a little better. We both really enjoyed the beauty and lights of the Santa Monica Pier! While we didn’t go on the rides, we still enjoyed walking along the pier and taking in the sunset.At night, the pier truly comes to life. The lights and the shows are even more magical against a dark city. Of course the pier is a great attraction during the day, it just seems to take on a whole different vibe. Overall, I would definitely recommend for both locals and visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LizzyMarie23
40,Attractions closed in morning,"Attractions were closed in morning when we went, but still good to get a view of the surrounds while buskers play. And saw our first seals of the trip...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stonerose5
20,"Gross. Don't waste your time, it stinks and there's garbage everywhere.","We visited this place on 3/27/18 and it was gross. The arcade is packed with people with B.O and the food options are also poor. I would consider it a classic tourist trap. The only fun thing about the Pier and the beach area to the south is the people watching. Lots of ""interesting"" folks to observe and enjoy the spectacle. Parking in the area is also a nightmare - be prepared with plenty of patience! My advice though - don't bother!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrw71
50,End of route 66,Easy to get to and lovely to walk round when it's not too busy the famous wheel is awesome love the place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djbpool

40,Love to visit Santa Monica Pier ~ Fun and beautiful!,"Love to visit Santa Monica Pier. It's fun to see the sights, the people, and the Ocean has a beautiful view of the sunset. I love to hang out here. The street vendors, etc. The food in the Santa Monica area is great. The Rides on the pier are great. My kids absolutely love coming to Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TWRoyal
50,Fun place for all ages,We were at the pier for a quick day trip. It has something for all ages. Be sure to ride the antique carousel - a cheap and fun diversion! We also highly recommend partaking in the free tours that are offered the visitor center at the east end of the pier. Our guide gave us a fantastic historic overview of the pier as we strolled it’s length. Highly recommend!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geoteacher068
30,Too Crowded,I liked the pier and pacific park but it was too crowded and anything out of the ordinary. It was cool to have a walk there but too much noise and people with noisy instuments.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eubs
40,Nice Experience,"Went to the pier on a whim and it turned out to be a very good afternoon. The history, shops, food, games and rides really made it the all around experience for our family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christopherwC3598IH
50,Everyone should walk the pier,I think it goes without saying that if your in SoCal near the coast you should visit the pier. It’s an iconic California landmark that many people would recognize from pictures and movies. It’s a cool place to walk and people watch. I like coming at night to see all the lights.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vanlon
30,Interesting only because so near the city,Sorry. Not a fan. I have seen alot of boardwalks and this is just one of many and not very special. There are performers that are interesting but I was not impressed overall.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VacaAllie
50,So much fun here,"Went with my partner and Daughter. We had the best time. So much fun. It was a great sunny but cool day. The roller coaster was the highlight. I love rides and even though this isn’t the biggest or fastest coaster I have been on, it was just fun. Lots of side alley games as well, try your luck at winning a prize. Gift stores and places to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicolemL13
40,By Walk,Nice place for a good walk under the sun.Lot of shops for tourist.Street art a bit everywhere.Some bars and restaurant.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BastienG95
50,Beautiful,I loved stopping by the Pier during my trip to LA. Beautiful views and the swings on the beach were a nice treat.It was windy and cold when I visited but I could tell it would be a great place to go on a sunny summer day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/austinblakee
40,A brief visit,"So I visited Santa Monica Pier with a large group and mainly hung out at the beach. There is a staircase down to the beach just past Bubba Gump Shrimp. From afar it looks like lots of restaurants, shopping and tourists. Be ready for crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicamL8390WB
30,Fun.,The pier is pretty. The kids had a good time. They walked to the pier and back several times. The only problem is that you have to pay 30 for a wristband and then extra for the ride the kids really wanted to go on. It should be included.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellykJ3902EG
50,This Stop Gives You A Local Flavor of the Area.,This stop provides you with a stunning view of the ocean and the coast line. It also provides a local flare of the characters in the area. Just a nice stroll for a relaxing day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/622hollyl
30,Expensive leisure,In my opinion the visit is only worthy for pictures and walking. Shows are a scam (the same Route66 mug doubles the price here than Hollywood Blvd). Arcades are fun but I think they take advantage of people's nostalgia.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arce69zamora
50,Vibrant atmosphere,"Good place for a later afternoon early evening stroll, though it is very busy. You can drive your car and park in the carpark off to the side of the pier. Big Ferris wheel and some rides. Lots of souvenir shops and some places to eat and street entertainment. Walk to the end and watch the sun go down or go fishing Went in march so really windy and cold so take a warm article of clothing",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jogosolo
30,Tourist Trap,"Very crowded and parking is insane so be prepared to drive to several parking lots before you find one that isn't full. Everything is expensive, but food was decent. Rides cost a lot, but you can get a band for a fair price if you are staying for the day. Worth a one time trip, but won't visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Raylynn2014
10,Dont waste your time.,Went on a Sunday and waiting time. was an hour at bubba gumps. Drove back to Anaheim and went to red lobster instead.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ne233l
40,Vacation,We went on the rainiest day of our vacation of course. Very easy to find parking. The beach area was very clean. I could have stayed for hours watching the waves roll in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crusier4life
50,Stunning ocean views and lively characters,"We took the bus from Beverly Hills down to Santa Monica (about half an hour to 45 minutes) and had one of the best leisurely Sunday afternoons I've ever had. While the pier was very busy, it just added to the atmosphere that everyone was there to have a good time and enjoy the sun. The views of the Pacific Ocean were also stunning, accompanied by a live violinist entertaining the crowds. We didn't get chance to go into the funfair, but still appreciated the iconicity of it, and everyone there seemed to be having a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveller0893
50,Beautiful views,"Santa Monica pier is one of the best piers I've visited. From the beginning to the end and back. Although we didn't go on the carousel this time it's so big its housed in its own building, which also has a cafe. Outside back on the pier you have all the gift stalls, novelty stalls, a couple of restaurants and of course Bubba Humps Shrimp Co restaurant and gift store. There is a mini fun fair with a spectacular Ferris wheel, which changes its pattern and colour continually. Bungee jump is very popular as is the fishing off the end of the pier. The fisherman can be seen catching the fish then throwing them back into the group's of waiting seals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrissandi
50,It is what you make it,"It is what you make it and it is really a hive of activity and the focal point for the area. If you like it is a really brilliant place just to sit and people watch. A lot of activities located here at the pier with rides, cafes and restaurants, and a really good spot to view the sunset over the Pacific but there early to get the best spots. It costs nothing to go on the pier so it is simply what you make it; had a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcgW9368OI
40,Iconic spot - classic boardwalk theme,Everything the pier should be. Pricy but all sorts of foods and amusements. Artists performing and a fun way to spend some time. Good eatery @ Albright’s - tables in the sun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theskiing62018
40,Fun in the sun !?!,"Old pier with rides, places to eat, and tourist shops. More cheesy then I thought it would be. I am familiar with the Jersey shore, but the boardwalks in Jersey seem nicer then the Santa Monica pier. Went once and is enough. For families will be fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeeMahwah
20,Tourist spot with carnival atmosphere. Once was enough for us.,"For $30 you can get an all day ride band. But how many times can you ride a small ferris wheel, tiny coaster, and scrambler. They also sell individual ride tix for $8-$10. There are a few restaurants.  Souvenir shops, fair food, and street musicians line the rough wood boardwalk. Parking on a spring day was $10. Not sure if it's more in the summer. Tons of Sandy beach. We heard it is packed towel to towel on hot summer days.The best part was getting off the puer and walking along the paved path northward. Lots of volleyball to watch. Be careful of bikes, scooters, and skaters that share the path.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbwyer
30,Meh. Good spot to people watch and ad lib their conversations from afar.,"I mean, it’s the pier. Flocks of sea gulls attacking each other for loose morsels, music artists of varying skill fill the air with sound fading into one another. But per one former professional now turned hip-hop karaoke performer, he loved it and wouldn’t have it any other way. Homeless people with signs juxtaposed against gaggles of egotistical teen girls taking endless selfies made me almost jump over the pier, but I noticed the arcade had skee-ball, so I was saved. The little kids meandering about was pretty cute and the fishermen casting out was romantic in a way. Unfortunately, the churro machine broke down as I was in line, so the pangs of hunger in my stomach echoed the pangs of sadness in my soul at this odd little corner of the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/905seanh
50,Had a blast!,"If you are in LA you have to go to Santa Monica Pier! Tons of people watching and the beach is gorgeous. No need to plan anything special, you can just spend the day walking and taking in the sites. I was most impressed with the views of the mountains up against the ocean. It was breathtaking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/99patriciak
40,Nice place to walk around but crowded.,"If you are in Santa Monica, it is nice to walk to the pier. It can be crowded, particularly on weekends. There is a carnival atmosphere in the middle which is fun for kids. It can be a bit windy and cold.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joethecritique
30,No too bad,Homeless the bigest issue. People on thr streets its not good sign of Santa Monica beach.Good parking.It could more coffe shops.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aidaa971
50,Tribute to a Bygone Era,"With its amusement rides, shops and numerous vendors, the Santa Monica pier is a true tribute to a bygone era. While the weather did not allow us to sample many of the rides, we did enjoy the carousel (cash only for a ride) and of course the ocean view. I am not a big fan of Mexican food, but the meal I had at Mariasol was very authentic and there are many choices for dining from national chains to street type vendors. Definitely worth a stop if you are in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EconMom
50,Santa Monica,This Iconic pier deserves a visit. Not to forget when you go to LA. And there is an excellent restaurant at the beginning of the pier where you can eat lobsters.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pierref798
40,Good place to visit,Went with my 20 year olds and there was something for all of us to enjoy. Beautiful views and plenty of benches if you want to take a break or just people watch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AR128

40,You Can't Not Go!,It's an iconic spot in LA and you can't not go there but don't expected anything particularly fabulous. It's a pleasant walk down the pier but it's probably best viewed from the beach at sunset. The kids will love it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShelleyJ304

10,Huge Disappointment,"This is not a family friendly destination. The entrance to the pier is laden with vagrants, junkies, and ""activists"". The pier itself leaves a lot to be desired. A few restaurants, a couple rides, assorted vendors, some street musicians, and an arcade. Nothing special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W7184FLtarab

50,Fresh air and fresh fruit...good reason to walk the pier...,"The pier is always a fun place to people-watch…After eating lunch at Gilbert’s on Pico, I took a Blue Bus westbound to downtown Santa Monica, which I was able to board with my Metro TAP card. The Santa Monica Pier shows up in many movies and television shows, so there’s that, and the people watching. However, my purpose to walk the pier was to, of all things, get a pound tub of fresh fruit…and I mean fresh. They cut the fresh fruit (includes cucumbers, too) of your choosing right in front of you. Watermelon, pineapple, apples, you name it. The dollar amount is comparable to store fruit, but this is so much better, squeezed with lime and a sprinkle of cinnamon—the varieties of fresh fruit with all those flavors teasing your taste buds while walking in the open sea air, there is nothing like it. I paid about $7 or $8 for the small tub of fruit and I ate every bit of it and wanted more; I don’t think I’ve ever felt healthier! Its a good naturally sweet snack, a good alternative to other less healthy choices. Don't get me wrong, I love cotton candy, too, but the fruit is fabulous. The vendors work hard in the hot sun…it is a long day for them, so tip them—they really appreciate it. Between the fresh air and fresh fruit it was a good walk on the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeMeDaVinci
40,Amazing place to visit,"It's awesome, don't get me wrong. And this may sound contradictual, but there are too many tourists.. went there at 9 am, and place was already packed. Nevertheless, still a great spot that you need to see once you're in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larsv165
40,A must see in Santa Monica,"This Pier is is a lot of fun. It has a great view to the ocean. There is also amusement park, restaurants and shops. Food is expensive ...maybe better to bring snacks and drinks along. We parked our car at the hotel room and walked over the five blocks...did not have to pay parking fees.I really enjoyed the musicians entertaining visitors. The violinist was exceptional and Caribbean music was beautiful. We really enjoyed our walk on the Pier.I highly recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yfess2

50,Had a great time at the Pier,"We had a great time at the Pier today. It is a great place to get an awesome view of the ocean, coast with green hills, or people watch. We also had a great time riding the rides at Pacific park. It has a roller coaster, Ferris wheel, sea dragon and more. If you plan on going on more than 3 rides it is worth it to get the bracelets so you can ride unlimited rides. My 8yo could ride all the rides the park had to offer.The one thing I would suggest doing is packing water and snacks in a back pack because food and drinks are expensive (5$ bottle of water).Overall had a great time. I would go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P6655XTvictorc

We aren't really into the carnival games and rides, just stopped for a few to check it out.We tried to rent a bike there to ride down the beach but it was taking too long and was like $20 per hour and they closed at 4pm and it was already 3pm. Googled other bike rentals and there was one right in front of (just off) the pier (2 minute walk) and it ended up being $21 for 3 bikes for the hour and it was no hassle and quick and they were very nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gsgman777

Overall it's kind of run down but still romantic, we did the Ferris wheel which was fun for couple of starry eyed tourists. Everyone who was working on the pier was very nice though so it seemed like they enjoyed being there which definitely made it easier for us to enjoy ourselves. Overall now that I have done it once I likely wont return here for some time but I'll be back someday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sammeir

Interesting street musicians( see picture of Lenny Hoops, awesome musician who happened to have a full size trash can for donations : that is positive thinking!). Amusement rides included small coaster , Ferris wheel, and good variety of smaller rides. We enjoyed ice cream shakes at the ice cream shop. There is an aquarium located beneath the pier, but we did not visit it. Amazing carousel on the pier, in an amazing wooden building.Tips : wear comfortable shoes. Any type of clothing goes. Pets are welcome, tons of people walking dogs. Be sure to bring bathing suits for dip in ocean, but temp of water in March is only 60 degrees! Sandy beach is beautiful and wide .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DCbikerman

30,Famous and must walk to say you have,"The Santa Monica Pier is always in the movies and you see it in the postcards but to tell you the truth, it is a tourist destination and that is what you have to expect. The beach is a little on the smelly side but walk out along the pier and see the attractions. Tacky souveneirs to take home or have lunch at the bubba gump shrimp company. Be prepared to take a jacket as it is so far out into the ocean that the ocean breeze is quite chilly. It supposed how far out it actually is and it is quite a walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kerrivv

50,Tourist trap,"If you want to be surrounded by people taking pictures, eating cotton candy and having a great time, then you should check out the pier. It’s always busy and buzzing. Always someone playing the guitar and singing for the crowd. Bring a couple bucks for these artists! Or grab a post card and a t shirt. It’s a tourists dream and a locals nightmare. There are some fun bars though just off the pier. And the parking is much cheaper.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lynzii77
30,Really touristy...at least it's free though?,"A Tuesday...at 2pm...this place was slammed. Call me surprised but a ton of kids and teenagers were here. I guess no school on Tuesday?

50,The Pier Sunset,"If you're venturing to the Santa Monica Pier you should definitely prepare yourself to stay for the sunset. The sunset is one of the best views ever and the Pier lights up at night and the smell of the nearby restaurants seems to fill the surrounding air more intensely. There are vendors that sell pocket boomerangs that are pretty cool for kids or teens. Depending on arrival time and the day of the week the pay parking can be a nightmare but it it worth it to experience the beach and pier.

We saw lot after lot with plenty of open spaces, but the entrances were blocked off with ""lot full"" signs. No one was monitoring parking, and modifying the signage as conditions change.

40,Classic pier experience - and the end-of-the-road,More entertaining on a nice day or warm evening than I experienced on this trip (cool night in March) but still worth doing.

The weather was cool enough that you needed a sweatshirt by 2:00, but not freezing. There were interesting people performing and some small shops. Food places were quite crowded and seemed clean, although due to the climate there, they didn’t appear clean. We did not go on or near the rides.

The sunset was beautiful, however the pier was super busy and had annoying street entertainers who took away from the overall atmosphere who were with on their political rants or playing their music so loud I could not have a conversation with my friends.

There is so much activity going on ranging from amusement rides (which I didn’t do) to musical entertainment to souvenir shops to viewing posts on the pier, plus some eating spots. The views are amazing as you get to see both sides of the beach. I suggest you be there for sunset. What a treat! I walked out onto the beach and joined many others in taking photos and basking in the scenery. It feels very California and the pier is a lot like Times Square.

Whether cruising and watching the crowds or playing Frisbee... California will always be California. Even when I lived in a more remote area in Laguna during my college years, I never really laid on the beach. People were playing basketball or jogging, rollerblading or on skateboards. Great food stops, music stops and lots of things to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eadyesimpson
30,Nice.,"The pier was a nice place to visit. Plenty of shops and places to snack.

40,Midway Fun,A classic LA icon. Not everyone’s favorite place but great fun for kids of all ages. Grandchildren from 6 to 16 all had a wonderful time on the rides and in the arcade. Rollercoaster and Ferris wheel were the most popular rides and the arcade was a great way to keep the kids engaged. Don’t go there to eat. No good or even mediocre restaurant on the pier. Great people watching.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F5673VNwilliamc
30,A carnival attatched to a pier,"This is the ultimate tourist trap with high priced diabetes-inducing fried carnival food, meager carnival rides, and a lot of people selling tourist junk in the stores.

50,What a fun time!,"We came on a Thursday afternoon and stayed until sunset. It is an incredibly beautiful setting and the people watching is pretty awesome. Watching the street performers was hilarious and at times jaw dropping. Pacific Park was a fun amusement park with nice employees. We snapped a ton of pictures. The beach was quite clean, surprisingly. We could’ve parked right at the pier for $10 but made a mistake and parked in a covered garage across the street for $21... that was a lesson learned. The amount of riff raff was actually at a minimum, which again was very surprising. We were very happy with our decision to come!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dawgmatt
20,Nothing to write home about.,"If it wasn't for the amusement park, this pier would be nothing else.

50,Vibrant and lively,"Loved being here as a tourist. The whole vibe, cute amusement park, sunset, beach, everything combined makes this place a one of a kind, magical place to be.

50,"""we had a great afternoon at this Pier""","This is a must visit place, there is a lot to see and do. you will see people working out at the beach, entertainers,you will be able to buy your souvenirs and enjoy the beautiful views of Santa Monica, CA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcialg809
50,Fun day at the beach,"Rent bikes, walk everywhere, enjoy the sun & sand. A great beach & pier anytime. All kinds of food is available. Bikes are affordable. Head down to Venice & Marina del Ray for a great couple of hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EllenI772
50,Great for the family,"We had never been to Santa Monica and were worried about things to do with the kiddos, and this was perfect and we had so much fun here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joJR80
40,Good photo opportunities,Cool place to hang out for a few hours. Kids young kids would enjoy the carnival type amusement park. Ate at the Bubba Gump Restaurant and was good but pricey.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T700VJandrew
40,a classic sight,It was amazing to see the end of route 66. We had photos with the sign on the pier. We rode on the wheel and the rollercoaster. We ate at bubba gumps and enjoyed the beach. couldn't be more different from Worthing West Sussex. Even hired bikes and rode to Venice Beach which was lots of fun and very safe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonjpayne2017
40,A classic,This seems like you can not travel all this way to not go to the pier. It was alright the rides were very over priced but that is to be expected.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melissasa14
50,First Time Here,"It was our first time here at the Pier. We came at night, and were able to use our GO LA pass to get on the roller coaster which was cool. Lots of kids and familys having fun. It was even just fun looking at all the lights sparkling in the distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsB1025
50,Beautiful,"Visited at sunset, what a beautiful picturesque place. So much going on. Entertainers all along pier, carnival attractions & of course the iconic Ferris wheel. Lovely walk along pier soaking on the atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoranYag70
40,Friday Afternoon Fun,"We visited the pier on a Friday afternoon, walking to the end of the pier and then getting to the rides as they were opening. We bought the unlimited band (highly recommend) and rode as many times as we wanted in an hour. The view from the Ferris Wheel is awesome! Our 8 year old loved the rides. We kept our bands on and went back after dinner to experience the roller coaster in the dark. Very fun. We did not eat on the pier - we chose a restaurant nearby on Ocean Ave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindsayw306
50,"Scenic, iconic and fun","Nice spot with live music, rides and views all around the pier. Route 66 ends here, from Chicago. We had a nice beach walk from our hotel to get here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K1027
30,Santa Monica Pier at Night,"Got into Santa Monica later in the day, and decided to walk the boardwalk in the evening. Perhaps because it was at night and dark, it seemed to invite all kinds of people and we decided follow our comfort level and not stay very long. We enjoyed all the lights and action of the Pier from the hotel, and it was just as beautiful as depicted in advertising.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cro_sandy72
40,Fantastic Spot on Pacific Ocean Coastline,"One of the few places I can recommend being fun for all in Los Angeles. The Ferris wheel on the Santa Monica Pier can be seen in numerous tv shows & movies and is part of a great little amusement park that is ON the Pier.You can park directly on the pier; just drive down the big hill and follow the signs. You could also park in one of the public lots up the street, but it's a pretty steep walk back up (especially if you're pushing a stroller or have tired, small children with you). Touristy shops line the pier and there's a Bubba Gump restaurant at the base of the pier. The view of the Pacific is incredible.My absolute favorite thing on the Santa Monica Pier is a once in a lifetime experience - The Trapeze School of New York (Los Angeles location) has a spot where you can take flying trapeze lessons. There is nothing quite like flying through the air looking out over the ocean. If you're looking for a really unique activity to do that's not the typical L.A. vacation, check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/honeybee3087
50,One of LA's Best Beaches! Bring the Whole Family!,"The Santa Monica pier was a super cool place for the whole family, and you must give the better portion of your day to being there. It's a pretty long walk across the bridge especially if there are little kids with you and they may get tired out pretty fast. Once you are actually at the pier, there is a lot going on. If you see some people with a spinner offering you 2 free nights of vacation, it's most likely a scam. It was fun to play, however. There was also a small basketball court which part of the all-star NBA weekend took place, which was cool to see. The mini amusement park was really awesome, and a lot of the carnival game booths on the side were really fun, and the prizes all large and possible to win. There were a many rides, and the coolest was by far the roller coaster, which is very easy but goes around twice. There is also a boat swing, frogger, and more, which gives people of all ages a ton to do. Each ride varied from around $5-10, yet unlimited rides for the whole day was only $18, so that would be super fun to do if you have the whole day. The ticket booth in the front has a huge line, but if you sneak your way to the back entrance, there is a booth with almost no one in line (don't tell!). The beach is worth walking around in, but personally the amusement park was the best part. Since everything is nearby, people can choose what they would like to do and meet up right after, making it the ideal situation (much like Coney Island in NYC). If in LA, this is one of the coolest and most fun experiences at little to know price, so you should make your way down to the Santa Monica pier!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Durga1047
50,Just as i had imagined it to be!!,"The beach first of all was simply breathtaking the sheer size beach blew me away andthe homes on the beach are beautiful. The Pier was exactly how i imagined it to be , It was almost caught in a time warp and i loved it, hopefully get back some time in the future and spend more time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X3851IEkarenc
40,The Attraction of Santa Monica,"The Santa Monica Pier is an iconic destination for tourists and locals alike. Stroll the boardwalk, eat street food and play arcade games.Pro Tip: Kick off your shoes and walk out to the sand. Stand under the pier and take it in from a different point of view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessdarke

40,The Best of LA,The hardest part about a visit to Santa Monica and it’s Pier / Boardwalk is the drive. When you finally reach the ocean it’s like the rest of the city melts away. If you are lucky enough to find a beach-front hotel you can relax and enjoy the view of the Pier and then visit it at night when it’s all lit up!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grigdon
40,A must to visit,Well worth a walk along the pier and take in the bracing fresh air. If you like additional entertainment go for a ride on the big wheel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JB084439

40,"Lively place, but small",It is a smaller than I though from th movies. Lively place and good view to the city beach. Worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/747phamg
40,Great stop in Santa Monica,"The pier has rides and crowds. I enjoyed the eclectic crowd more than the rides. Fun to see the yoga, hula hoops, skaters. Cleaner than Venice beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeredithL236
40,Good first experience,First time to the pier. It was a cool experience. Lovely views. Prepare to pay for parking. Metered parking is $2 an hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keidra01
50,Pleasant to watch the Ocean,"We are on holiday during the Winter, but took a stroll along the pier and it was a pleasant experience. We saw buskers, souvenir stalls and fast food outlets. Fishing is allowed on the end of the pier. The floor is old and uneven with a funfair on the side. Entrance to the pier is free.Worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebbieQ937
50,Part of the tour,Neat place to visit. We went on a beautiful Saturday afternoon so it was very crowded. Lots to do on the pier and also a beautiful beach. Tons of restaurants across the road from the pier. Parking was scarce but was worth the time to see it. Came back a week later at night. Gorgeous view of the Ferris Wheel as we drove down the PCH(pacific coast highway).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KurtR67
40,Beautiful ocean & mountain view,A little touristy by the views of the beach and mountains are spectacular. We got tacos at a little place here and they were sooo good! A bit crowded but not so bad that you can't get away easily if you need to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JodiS145
50,Great place to visit and lots of things to do around,"We visited LA as a family with kids. There is lots of things going on at the Pier itself, and there is broad walk around. You can also go to the shore itself and spend time on the beach. They have 3 streets parallel to the beach with walking zones, lots of restaurants and many cheap city parking garages (Streets 2,3,4). There is mall right there too, you just walk off from the pier and continue one block straight, mall will be on your right. So great place to be overall. In the evening it is very safe and again tons of people walking around, sitting at the cafes and going by the water. They have very nice illumination at the streets 2,3,4. This is probably the most alive place in LA in the evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisa670
40,Iconic,"Spent a few hours exploring Santa Monica and you must go checkout the iconic pier. Great views of the coast line, entertaining buskers and good for people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottybrowndog

40,Something Fun To Do On A Saturday,"We went to the Santa Monica Pier to let the kids have fun on the rides. There is parking right at the pier and it was a flat $12. I read that online but there was so much traffic that we just parked at the Shore hotel for a flat $15 and walked a block over to the pier.There are a lot of people and a lot going on. It was cool to know that it is the end of Route 66. Your typical boardwalk and food. We ate at Pier Burger, walked to the end of the pier and then went to the amusement park.We had the LA Go Card. A great value for everything that we did in Southern California including the Santa Monica Pier Amusement Park",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lezmi89
40,"Fun for kids, adults, couples, or groups","The Santa Monica pier has a carnival atmosphere with a ferris wheel, arcade games, souvenir shops, and other games. It is beautiful any time of day, but especially nice at sunset, especially on a rare clear day without the smoggy haze that is so common. The pier has restaurants and souvenir shops or stands all along the pier that overlooks the beach and the ocean. Great places for lunch, dinner, snacks, or drinks.There are people performing music, some extremely talented (an impressive violin with an amplifier and another playing an acoustic version of ""Hotel California""), and some more unintentionally comical like a man in his 50s that performs in a gladiator-type skort and dancing the Macarena (yes, I know it, I admit it :) to a rendition of Prince's ""When Doves Cry.""Another thing to mention, but not to be concerned about, there are usually panhandlers asking for money, but none of them were aggressive or dangerous. I went 3 times in a week, once for lunch and twice for dinner, in a group of 2 to 4, and there was never a problem.Great views, good variety of restaurants, a good place for tourist souvenirs, and you can take the stairs to the sand, and go down to the shoreline if you want. They also have a shower and a foot shower (don't pull the wrong handle!) to rinse off the sand. The water is very cold in months like January, even though the high when I was there was in the mid 70s to mid 80s, but considering there was snow on the ground back home, it was nice to enjoy the warm mild weather, the view, and the seafood!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferrX7277BH
40,Pier Pressure,Heading from LA up the Pacific Coast Highway today Santa Monica was our first stop. It was one of our favourite places in LA and taking time to stroll along the Pier and soak up the atmosphere was well worth it. Great views and plenty to see and do if you have the time. We only stayed long enough to walk up and back as the road was calling!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zalgariath
40,Good musicians fun place,"Park close to the beach, $7 per day. Lots of entertainers. The restaurant at the far end is where you want to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christophercA8542WG
40,Beautiful Day,"Lots of fun and not very crowded. Beautiful beach day for February, awesome for people watching. We rented a tandem moped-like bike and cruised down to Venice Beach. Make sure to stop at some thrift stores for designer labels. Ate lunch at Shutters- great day! Ride the roller coaster (pricey though)!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmac0126

40,Great iconic spot!,"Loved our stroll along the pier. Not sure if rides don’t operate during the week or not? We went to ride the Ferris wheel one week night and it as well as all the other rides were closed. We found pier parking to be easy. Look out for the monks, the try to give you a bracelet and then want $10 for them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/457hannaw

50,Great walk,"When in LA I park up on Ocean Park dr then walk down to the pier and to its end. Definitely people watching but please note the area is loaded with food trucks BUT lots of homeless on the walk overlooking ocean. Lots of people walking, jogging , dogs etc but on clear day a must walk to enjoy just be aware of surroundings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alwaystravel999
40,Spend a few hours,"Its not a mind blowing experience to come here, but its still nice to walk up and down the pier, in a leisurely fashion, no rush, and take it all in.There's the overpriced souvenir shops, entertainers, an amusement park, and restaurants to keep you busy, or you can just look out at the nice views over the water and beach and up the coast.We parked on the main drag and walked down, and that seemed a cheaper option and a nice way to see some of the beachfront town as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/b_long176
50,Fun at night!!!,Great place to end up after a long day of touring the LA area. Great Mexican restaurant on the end of the Pier. The pier was clean (cleaner than the rest of the area) and we felt safe. We saw a cool bicycle parade that was all lit up and that was cool. A beautiful carousel at the beginning of the walk out into the pier. The colorful Ferris wheel overlooks the ocean. Quite a beautiful site.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anna11horton
50,Santa Monica,"This place was so much fun. Great place to take pictures, people watch. We rented bikes and rode to muscle beach on Venice. Really cool place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daneenl2017
40,It's got to be on your list.,"I read mixed reviews on this site about Santa Monica and the pier which almost put me off going. When we arrived at the pier on Sunday afternoon about 2, it looked very busy and generated a oops maybe we made a mistake moment. Saying that when we entered the pier it felt very comfortable. Lots of food stalls. Live music. Fair ground rides and souvenir stands. Regardless of being the end of route 66, I just thought it was a fun place to pass a good hour or so. The people were very nice and no hassle or pressure at all and the sun set to die for. Bubba Gump shrimp company restaurant was a great addition sitting at the start of the pier. The food will not set the world on fire but the service and experience was a great end to a very nice afternoon. Don't miss this one off your list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/portfolioman
40,Santa Monica Pier,"We took 9 teens (17) and 3 adults to the Pier. It was a gorgeous day in January so we walked Venice to the pier. Enjoyed the rides, walking the pier to the end, shopping and eating. Neat place to visit and walk around. Only warning was food places are limited as far as sit down restaurants. Alot of walk up carts and windows, but not full service restaurants right on the Pier. Bubba Gumps is very popular and we put our names in for a party of 12 and waited about 45 minutes. They were great about moving orders, food, etc. I would return here for a fun beach day plus!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShellyS31170
50,Nice sunny day in the pier,Usually jammed parking can be a challenge and the food is boardwalk or amusement park quality. Be careful with your belongings. Worth seeing but the view is just amazing specially from the Ferris wheel.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexlL3654CM
40,Leisure walk after a dinner,was surprised not seeing a lot of tourists on Wednesday night with a super nice weather & clear moon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesdR630SS
50,Surprisingly fun,"Spent a lot longer here than expected due to the number of rides and stores crammed into this small area. Ended up riding the coaster and ferris wheel, got some great views of the sun setting from up there. There's also a pretty awesome arcade with some old classics like Centipede and Street Fighter II, as well as air hockey and Foosball tables, very fairly priced (most games were between 50 cents and a dollar per go). It went from just taking a look, to spending a few hours on the pier before taking a walk on the lovely beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulbN8315FP
50,Love the pier,I went to the pier 3 times in the 4 days I was there. Twice at night and once during the day.It’s a really fun place to visit. Tons to do and see! Family friendly. Rides and games for the kids. Street performers riddled the pier. Everyone was just having a freaky great time. The lights at night are awesome. Walk to the very end and turn around to see the lights!!There are people fishing off the pier day and night. We stopped to watch them fish for a bit while drinking coffee from the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf.You could go down to the beach and play in the ocean or just sit and watch/listen to the waves crash against the shore. Plenty of places to eat and gets snacks.Easy to get an Uber to and from. It’s a must see if you’re in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W6661FSryanm
50,Every now and then you have to go to the Ferris wheel over the ocean,"There is a place that ALWAYS takes the blues away. When I am on the West Side, during the week, I try to get on the Ferris wheel over the ocean for a quick attitude adjustment. There is something that can be cured by flying alongside seagulls high above the water below. If you want to do something SUPER special and the wallet is thin, jump on the metro to the end, and walk to the pier. A whole new world is there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/510kerryg

40,Pier made for fun,"Our first time there. Glad we went. So much history since it opened in 1909. We didn’t go to the amusement park but there were lots of people there, riding the Ferris wheel and other rides. There were several entertainers singing, dancing or doing magic tricks as we walked along, making it fun. But the views of the beach and the ocean were what drew me to want to go back. We had lunch on the patio of a restaurant at the end of the pier and it was delightful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/houstontravelingfool
40,Legendary!,"Opened in 1909, the 1400-foot-long Santa Monica Pier is one of the most iconic seaside piers on the west coast (and all) of the USA. It has been featured in countless films, television shows, music videos and even video games (Grand Theft Auto V immediately comes to mind). It has been designated a historic landmark since 1976 and has a rich, storied history since its opening. (Seriously, read a little bit about it and discover some of its more darker past during Prohibition and the WWII era. It's fascinating!)It's also REALLY cool to visit. At just over ¼ of a mile long, the pier offers lots of entertaining options to keep you busy for a few hours. Most noticeable/famous on the pier is the Pacific Park seaside amusement park (with its legendary Pacific Wheel Ferris wheel and West Coaster junior roller coaster), along with 10 other rides. Additional options include the original Hippodrome building (with its original indoor carousel) from the 1920s, a trapeze school(!!), the Santa Monica Pier Aquarium, plus numerous shops, restaurants, bars/pubs, entertainers, and other attractions. At the far western end of the pier, you will see numerous anglers fishing, as well as find restrooms and a somewhat upscale restaurant for memorable dining. The pier is fun during the day, but it's at night when it REALLY comes alive, with all the lights, music, cool ocean breeze and entertainment options that give it a magical quality. You never know what you're going to see there, from Chinese Acrobats, to musicians playing exotic and foreign instruments many Americans aren't accustomed to seeing, to fortune tellers, magicians, and other acts. It really is a neat place to visit. The Santa Monica Police Department has a station on the pier, so police presence is regular. I've never felt unsafe while visiting.It's busy though. Even at night, the pier can be so packed with people that walking gets difficult. I've seen lines for the rides at Pacific Park an hour long at 11pm before. Finding places to eat, places to grab a drink, and a place to park your car can be a real challenge. I recommend avoiding the Santa Monica Beach/Pier and Pacific Park on the weekends in the summer because it just gets to be too busy to truly enjoy yourself.Despite its popularity and overcrowding issues, if you find yourself in LA with time to kill and you haven't been to the Santa Monica Pier, you HAVE to go. It's one of those life experiences that you will be glad to cross off your bucket list (even if you never intend to return again)!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jakeg485
50,Crowded but amazing,"Wished I could've stayed longer. Views were great. Lot of entertainment on the Pier. Little Rock band put on a concert, some guy shirtless dancing and having a good time to some funny tunes. Only thing I disliked was PAYING 4$ FOR A WATER!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/isiahb2018
40,Fun Place!,"We were fortunate to visit this attraction on a warm January day; it was glorious! The air was clear affording wonderful views of the ocean. Parking was easy as we went on a weekday. On can actually park on the pier and there is a parking lot at ground level. There are public restrooms available, also. The pier was lots of places of places to eat, some shops, as well as several interesting buskers, or street musicians.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/449dalew

50,Nice beach,"The sunset is amazing here, I don't know why the colours are so nice compared to some other places I've been. The beach is huge, there is an amusement park, lots of food, and you can rent bikes or skates about 10 minutes walk away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R569UQchristinek
50,Mid winter vacation,"Santa Monica Pier is simply a fun place to be at, especially if you’re into people watching!Many places to eat, grab a coffee and watch the bay.We rented bikes and rode all the way down the beach-a wonderful two hour ride.There is a small amusement park as well to add to your fun.Every few feet, there are musicians, artists and even a dancing native, showing off his strange moves!The Pier is definitely a place to visit and spend the morning.Walk around Santa Monica and visit the shops, restaurants and if your lucky, the farmers market will be in full bloom.It’s a wonderful place to shop fresh and organic vegetables.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/schwekye
50,Came by for sunset,"Just as a must-do attraction of LA, we came to Santa Monica pier without expecting to take any rides, or eat there, or enjoy the beach - basically nothing that a tourist would do. We took a stroll along the pier and enjoyed the sunset; the views and buskers made the atmosphere a simply beautiful place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/summersbea
40,A nice walk and interesting atmosphere,"If you are looking for something to do in L.A. for an hour or so, go for a walk along Santa Monica Pier. Many colourful characters and stalls, a gorgeous carousel complete with icecreamery, and a beautiful beach. We didn't try to go on any rides, or buy any food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D9838QXsarahb
10,Very Tired,"My son wanted to visit this pier as of course has seen it in many tv shows. Needs a bit of an overhaul and is looking really really tired. Nothing to see really and some dubious buskers, a little on the weird side and everyone has their own CD to sell. Does anyone even use a CD player anymore.......",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Syddy2016
40,Santa Monica pier,Crowded and a very interesting mix of people. The pier itself is a fun walk and people watching but not much for food. Fairly long walk to the promenade area and not much to choose from for food.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M7923KHstephenc
30,Beach,Beautiful view of the ocean & walk along the beach. Santa Monica Pier was crowded & expensive for the kids to go on the rides.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/germainel2014
30,Pleasant walk,"While some relaxing time away here, take it slow, check out some kiosks. Nice view of the beach and the city from the pier. Take some fun rides if you feel like it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertgan
40,1 hr is enough,"We went in the evening...around 8 p.m and you can see the bay from the pier, it's a nice view. There's a park where you can buy tickets and enjoy in a rollercoaster or the wheel of fortune (I don't know if this is the correct name🤔)There are places where you can eat, buy some momorabilias or just enjoy the different artist that there are in the pier. If you like to take pictures...this is a great place. You can park there ($2 × hr) You can visit the end of route 66. You have to go there!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cote-Va-Chile
30,Disappointed,Lines were looong! Waited an hour to get on rides. I also waited 45 minutes in line to get a cup of coffee Finally walks away because the small coffee shop was so full you couldn’t move. We had a difficult time just walking on the pier. There were so very many people. I also expected it to be cleaner than it was. Couldn’t find any rest rooms either.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grammi48
30,Walk into the Past,The Santa Monica pier is a remnant of the past. There are many performers and small stalls lined along the pier. In addition to some carnival rides and arcade games. The pier does offer some spectacular views of the beach and scenery.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackAttack3209
30,Very nice place to visit if you need some beach time,It is very much talked about tourist attraction in LA. Not very close to downtown.The food is delicious there and so are the shops. There are street performances along side every day.Honestly just too busy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessofmed

50,Bucket List - Tick,"This has always been on my bucket list, and was a crucial part of my visit to California. We arrived at this area by UBER just outside of the main arch welcoming you to the pier. It was a beautiful day with the sun shining and you could see up and down the coast for miles. The pier has many attractions and restaurants which would appeal to everyone. The first place we saw was Bubba Gump Shrimp, but only visited the shop on this occasion. You will notice that there are several souvenir shops on the pier, but luckily they sell different things compared to Hollywood which was great. The funfair is the main attraction on the pier and proudly stands out. Its such an iconic attraction, and its great to see that it was always busy with families. There is a restaurant at the end of the pier, and an amazing viewpoint over the ocean (I took far too many photos at this point) I personally would highly recommend this location as it is full of little stalls and has an amazing history behind it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jlevans15
40,Beautiful,"The beach, the city, the attractions...it’s a magical combination. We even saw dolphins. All the musicians made it even more pleasant",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/797christinar
40,Busy Busy,"Just travelled to the pier for the first time. You park you are out 10 bucks but the rest is free. It was sunday and we decided to drive up from LA to see it. For my last couple of visits to LA I have tried to visit a couple of piers each time. (malibu, Huntington, Venice, etc..). This was the most fun of all so far to date more to visit you know. You can buy crafts, go to amusement park, visit Arlington West, listen to preachers, m.usic, etc... We left befor everyone was piling in to watch the sun go down from the pier. I would go back again",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glenncorbett

(Sunday visit),"We are visiting from England on a 2 week road trip!The pier was pretty busy but everywhere tends to be in LA we have quickly realised!We spent a while on the pier - there are plenty of places to eat although we didn't need food. There are also loads of great people from all walks of life and people entertaining others. There are lots of little stalls selling fridge magnets, souvenirs etc!We parked on the pier and this cost us $3 an hour which we thought was really reasonable and there were plenty of spaces.Recommend a visit - the beach is beautiful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Onlysophie

40,"Even if you are Californian, a walk on the Pier is a must","This eclectic venue is a slice of Southern California with its historic carousal, its fried seafood eateries and a multitude of individual craftsmen along the way offering all sorts of beach souvenirs . Crazy of course, especially on the weekends, but still a gotta do kind of experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/455sherriel

50,Old World Charm,"We came here to see a number of attractions. First we wanted to walk the iconic Santa Monica Pier, Wow - It did not disappoint, but was amazing.

20,Crowded,"I’m really not sure what is the big deal with the pier. They have a few rides for kids but I would never take my kids there unless you are prepared to grip their hands tight as you walk past the many people who are either homeless, drunk or high. The food smells like a heart attack waiting to happen and it’s too crowded to take a picture without someone else coming out. No reason to go here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Le0414
50,Great fun,What a cool vibe there is here. Real characters singing and dancing and also the rides with the distinctive Ferris wheel.The beach is beautiful and wee souvenir shops dotted along. Definitely pleased we made this trip here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CNWgtnNZ
50,Great experience,"Don't forget to grab an ice cream before you walk onto the pier, or to stick your head into the aquarium below, where you're greeted by a friendly staff that's willing to share with you about how they take care and then release endangered animals like nurse sharks etc.Be wary that it gets insanely crowded on weekends, but if you're around to catch a view of the sunset it's worth a million!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeanGeorges2013
50,First time on the pier!!,The view and scenery was breathtaking. This was our first time seeing the pier. There is something for everyone with vendors food and crafts and just everything.

40,Must-See,We road our bikes out to the pier and enjoyed ourselves. Our kids are too old for the rides but it's such a fun place to visit and the view of the mountains and ocean are wonderful. There are neat food stands for snacks and while we didn't park a car there seemed to be ample parking openings when we were there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maxpaste
30,Crowded and touristy,"When I’m in Los Angeles, I avoid Santa Monica Pier at all costs. It’s very crowded and touristy. Definitely stop by if you’ve never been before, but it’s not a place I’d recommend for a group of adults to visit together on a weekend in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/j_dido12
50,Beautiful old fashioned pier,Really good place for our morning stroll. Has a good funfair if you fancy some thrill seekingLobster restaurant nearby really gorgeous,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maggiea334

It’s a must see destination with shops, amusement rides, street entertainment, great views of the ocean and surrounding mountains. All for free. Easy access to the beach and available parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobalcorn5
30,"Could be fun, but......","This pier has an amusement park. It has some activities to do there, but I was bothered by how dirty it was and how many sketchy people there are. I was a bit creeped out. I have been there and seen it, but I will never go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jeepers_Mimi
50,Great visit ! .. dont miss this pier ..,"Its a great pier with a really nicd view , theres plenty of places to play, eat of all kind of food , ice cream, candies etc.. walking there is a great experience and theres a parking near the entrance ..

40,Very cool place,We walked out on the pier everyday! Lots of great views and people watching to be had. Lots of entertainment in a small area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CoffeeRoaster
20,I visited early morning so it was boring,Later that day the Pier put on her glad rags and looked pretty good from the road.The Ferris Wheel was attractive but certainly not The Eye!I personally find these places tacky with games of chance which might as well be a straight out donation.So even though it did look attractive from a far it didn’t call me to spend time there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cientje21
40,Beautiful,"We enjoyed our time there, was beautiful, lovely to walk around listening to so many pier performances, a good get away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rena1970

40,Lively,As a European/Asian I miss to be in the real (not in a concert etc.) crowd. That gives me the feeling to be a member of a society. Santa Monica is a great place to be among nice people and the Pier in the location where you can see them all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/690_nder_
40,Worth the trip,Went here with my 7 year old daughter. It was good to be on the pier. We did the aquarium and the rides which was a fun couple of hours. This is a best do while in Santa Monica,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldTraveler1976

50,Cool atmosphere,"We went on a thursday evening and then on a saturday evening: not the same vibe at all! It was very calm on thursday and we were almost alone. Some musicians were playing calm music.On saturday, it was crowded but we loved the atmosphere! You must go there just to walk around, dip your feet in the ocean et watch the ferris wheel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R41GAvanessab
50,Go at sunset to people watch.,Find a spot to watch the sun go down here. Interesting people to watch and always some entertainment. The shops and restaurants look so touristy they are best avoided. See the sea lions swim by.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aucklander68
40,First time,"My husband and I spend our birthday at the pier yesterday.What a blast we enjoyed every minute of itWe did not get on any of the rides but walked around, enjoy the sunset had a good dinner and listen to all the artist a long the pier.If you are big rides don't expect too much this is the old fashion carvival games,rides and food SUPER CUTE !!Unlimited Wristbands $29-39Popcorn $8Parking $10-20 or free (only on Sundays) a long the streets if you lucky enough to find oneJust to give you an idea.We will defently go back with our kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E7540GMsilviav

30,Go at sunset,"It’s fun to see the carnivalstuff on the pier, see and hear the performers, see the fishermen clean out their catch (if any) and sit on the beach.My partner was stung by a bee on the beach; dont know if thats something that occurs a lot but it was painful for an hour and less painful the days after.Fun for about an hour. City wifi available if lucky.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JerryO81
40,USA trip,Beautiful location easy to navigate an easy bus ride from Hollywood would recommend a good pair of shoes also 3 blocks from the pier is a great shopping area with no traffic in it only pedestrians great variety,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kalumbo
40,A Fair at the Beach,There are rides and souvenir booths and food vendors and craft displays all along this walkable boardwalk raised high above the beach. This is a nice family attraction. We saw people doing yoga in open areas near the pier itself.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CreateConnects
40,End of the trail,"I've spent a few years exploring segments of the historic Route 66 and finally made it to the end of the line. Living in the desert, it was refreshing to visit the coast and see the ocean. I came mid-week to avoid the crowds and that worked out, well. Dogs are permitted on the pier, but not the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harry_Hughes3
50,Beautiful Beach,"This is a must visit while in Santa Monica. The beach is beautiful and the pier is fun for the entire family. We parked our car and rented bikes to get a up close and personal feelOf the area. The shops are average beach shops with towels and souvenirs and regular goodies . Of course many smoke shops are also on the beach especially when We ended up at Venice. Venice beach has a huge skateboard park , this was only about 15 minutes from the pier. I enjoyed myself and can’t wait to get back!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Superfresh85

50,Historic Santa Monica Pier,"Great atmosphere huge beach - easy access by public transport great for families, couples or solo when you need a place to wander and thinkLots of side shows going on acrobatics etc only downside was the food not so great and expensive if I went again I would take a picnic though.All in all great day out oh and wait to buy souvenirs from the guy in the shop at the end of the pier near the sea he is nicer and better priced than the vendors who have stalls on the pier",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/victorias369

50,Fun place where everybody will find something to do,"Nice bright ambiance with filled with people from all age groups. Ran into a guy playing songs of Bruno Mars in a sitar. Yes, you read that right. Good food, lots of gift shops, benches to sit and just gaze at the infinite waterbody ... magical :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/776rajatd
20,Underwhelmed,"Ticked it of the bucket list but a very sad lacking place to visit. Beach is dirty, homeless everywhere and drug addicts as plentiful as tourists. Shops on pier selling junk at expensive prices.Rides 👎 keep your expectations low especially if you are from Australia.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michmash79
40,Reminded us of Home and Years gone by,"This is your typical old fashion pier by the sea with some lovewlt gift shops and the famous Bubba Gumps restuarant which is a must to experience as the food is fantastic,just make sure your hungary as the portions are BIG!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenjwilson27
30,Think the pier needs a make-over,"I think if you are rush for time, you can skip this place. Pier looks old to me. Went early evening so not as crowded as I expected, perhaps everyone was already done for the day. Souvenir stalls scattered around the pier with many buskers trying their luck but I thought it contributed to noise pollution - hip hop dancers, someone trying to sing a western, another girl singing the latest pop hits. I tried very hard to discover the charm of this place, but failed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hviv
50,Never Fails!,"Always a great place to visit and re visit! Plenty to do for everyone! The usual shopping, eating, plus more physical related activity for the young and active! Was with my family and we just added more memories again visiting this wonderful pier and it’s neighborhood! Perfect Weather too!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusieSD
30,Looking for a frozen banana,"We were on our way to Venice and took a wrong turn! Parking was $10 and crowded. There are a lot of vendors selling stuff, some in a kiosk and some just selling fruit out of a bin. Hey everyone has to make money so I wasn’t bothered. On the pier we tried to find a frozen banana, my favorite beachside treat but no luck. We walked and enjoyed the area, but it was very crowded on the pier. The boardwalk was a nice walk with lots of people watching!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bcrooked
30,Looking tired,This was my third trip over a 12 year period and the pier was looking worse for wear - I still think it’s a must see but would be good to get it upgraded to keep the icon looking good and worth the trip,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natconner
50,Fun place,We took the band for all rides and got onto each and every ride here. It was a fun time for sure. Everyone will enjoy here,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nityaraghu

50,A fun place to see at night...great food...great views!,"Went at night and the place was just beautiful. Lit up like a Christmas tree!... we got there a little late so the amusement park had just closed, so check closing time. Quirky little souvenir shops, buskers and yummy food. A happy place to be! I dare you not to sing the song! ( all I wanna do is have some fun...until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kenyon72
50,The Coolest Place EVER!,We took our young children here and the rides were perfect for all ages. Nothing too crazy here. The atmosphere was great. The beach was great. The Ferris wheel looks AMAZING at dawn! We highly recommend this attraction!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessecT7785PW
40,Great place for walking and sightseeing day or night,"We visited Santa Monica Pier during a summer evening in August. We parked near the mall in the city area, it was quick walk and parking wasn’t expensive. We walked by sights as we made our way to the pier. We stopped at a burger place on the pier that was good. We walked around for a bit and went through the amusement area. This is a fun place for a date night and for a walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/28mitchm
30,Colourful,"Dropped in on way to Venice Beach - kinda ‘cute’ but wouldn’t say spectacular.Bubba Gump had an hour wait, the Beach Burger Bar was nice instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karend367
50,Fun day and night,Make sure to go day and night to see it lit up. Very pretty and a great day with kids! Bathrooms are the cleanest too along this stretch of Santa Monica.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dimoo
50,Fun Historical Place,My husband & I enjoyed a quiet morning walk on the pier. The view was beautiful & fun! We saw a seal & a dolphin swimming around the pier. I'm sure it's a fun place when all the shops & rides are open but it was great for a nice walk back in history. You can see old pictures & read about the history of the pier. Even in the morning there was one musician playing pleasant music & a few souvenir shops were open.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TammiC318
30,Felt like waste of time!,We walked from Venice beach and compare to Venice which is so clean Santa monica is dirty and saw like 2 dead birds on the beach were kids was playing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angiet413
40,Good eating joints around,The pier was right outside out hotel so went down in the afternoon for a sightseeing and lunch. This was one long walk with restaurant and gift shops on the right side.we saw quite a few people fishing and saw lots of sea lions right below the pier. Sunset was an amazing sight. Just that the place was lot windy. I definitely recommend this place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/riyakatys
30,Great for a walk,Walking on the pier at Santa Monica is kind of a right of passage. The offering on the pier are second rate amusement park. The people watching and views along the beach are first rate.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PandCSki
50,New Year’s Eve!!,What a great way to ring in the new year! Watching the East Coast celebration fireworks from the roller coaster was awesome!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cbw418
30,"See it, but save your money","Great to go, see the view and take pictures. But certainly do not need to spend any money at any restaurant, store or ride. Again, great to go and have pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Peepye
40,Another One for my Bucket List,"I've been visiting Sourthern California at least annually since 1978. But I never made it to see the Santa Monica Pier until near the end of our last visit. The occaison was prompted by a visit to see my niece who had recently relocated from Brentwood to Santa Monica. We planned to meet for dinner after she got out of work. I went a little early so I could see the Pier. Found a parking spot a few blocks from the Pier and got to it just after sunset. The Pier was crowded with people and the lights had just come on. The Ferris Wheel and roller coaster were carrying lots of people. Lots of street musicians with skills that ranged from ear-hurting to pretty damn good. Lots of shops with stuff I think only tourists would buy. The restaurants weren't that interesting in that they were often-seen chain reataurants that charge higher prices because they are on the Pier. Even so, most of them were full of people. At the end of the Pier, there is a second floor observation deck and I'm sure the sunset views are absolutely stunning. Wouldn't recommend that visitors go out of their way and through heavy traffic to come here though. Unlike the Piers in Huntington Beach and Seal Beach, there isn't much room for people to fish.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Buck911
40,About what you would expect.,"Great place to visit just from an historic perspective. Not showy, more touristy. Fun place to ""people watch"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/isellrxs
50,An iconic local landmark,"I will preface this by saying we have small children so the rides on offer were perfect! We had a lovely day visiting this iconic landmark, a place we had only read about or seen on tv. It was full of rides and games that entertained my 3 small children and the view! Who could complain about the gorgeous Santa Monica beachfront. We have absolutely loved Santa Monica. Such a beautiful part of the world. Great for tourists!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SydneyHolidayMakers

40,Well you have to go,The end of historic Route 66. A mix of everything from t shirts shops arcade games food vendors fishing and amusement rides. It’s a must stop. Be prepared for a lot of people but sit back and soak it all in,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Biztravr
50,Nice experience 👍🏻,I wend last weekend...Very crowded but fun. We rented bikes which was cool but hard to navigate the crowds at times. Fun ride down to Venice Beach!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leonardo_Marbella
50,Great fun for a family!,"The pier has a Ferris Wheel, a Roller Coaster and a Merry Go-Round Carousel. There are two swings that are massive and each seat can accommodate 5-10 persons. There is also a high Trapeze for adults. There are multiple stalls where you can win prizes. There are lots of places to eat - fast food or you can eat at Bubba Gump Shrimp co - excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoderickL855
40,Nice views,"Just like in the movies the views are great. When you arrive you’ll notice the throngs of people taking pictures with the pier sign, which as expected it’s instantly recognizable. The actual pier is a tourist trap however, worth visitting to check it off your bucket list . Lots of typical touristy shops overpriced, with lots of tourists so expect overcrowding. The boards have seen better days so if you plan on wearing high heel’s or have some sort of a disability or difficulty walking you may need to be a bit carefulNot to be missed are the views from up on the promenade, both at sunset and at nightEnjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler2009
50,Winter Break,We visited the pier in early Jan and it was still warm and enjoyable. Walked around the pier for a while enjoying the views and some of the rides. Went down to the beach and rented bikes for $30 and road down to venice beach and back enjoying the atmosphere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A2755YNmarinad
50,First time,Was a great first time visiting here. I like fishing and I had a blast watching the people fish there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joedarmar
40,Overrated,"It is a must go to place when in L.A., but not worth the hype. The town of Santa Monica is worth the drive. It’s historical and picturesque...explore the town!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yettem2014
40,A fun place to visit,"We visited Santa Monica pier on a very hot friday in december. I've not visited in well over 20 yrs but not much had changed. There are rides for the kids & plenty of stalls selling hats, t shirts & vendors selling ice creams & food.Lots to see & do. Lovely old fashioned pier.Walk to the endear great views back to the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bl0ndie72
50,THE PIER,Santa Monica Pier just of Broadway was a nice visits free of charge loads of buskers and stalls souveneer shops all over easy to get round. We watched the local fishing from the end of the pier and there's a small park for rides ferris wheel and other little attractions. The beaches surrounding the pier go on for ever either side. There are a few beggers about that's maybe the off putting bit however you don't need to interact with them lots of police about. And you the Santa Monica place close by to do your shopping overall a good time was had by all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/actnow1200
40,"Dense fog, but loved the visit","The pier is so vibrant and lively, no matter the weather. It was a dense fog day, but with the lights up we had lots of fun!! Do try the blue ice cream with chocolate chip near the Pacific park!! My son enjoyed the carousel. There is local music and some people singing music and playing instruments along the pier while you walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sreeranjini
10,Don’t like this place,"Very dirty place, so crowded and unsafe!!!! Low quality food and restaurants!!! Overall I won’t go back there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noran425
40,Fun afternoon,We had a fun afternoon renting bikes and going up to Santa Monica pier. If you have a big chunk of the day to ride the rides the unlimited pass is worth it. But if you are only staying for a short period of time I thought the rides were a little expensive as it is $35 for unlimited rides for adults and $20 for unlimited rides for kids. Or each ride individually is 5-10$.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O1656UGkellyf
50,Fun place to skate and bike,Enjoy a nice skate or bike ride around the Santa Monica pier. Beautiful beach and also fun place to people watch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reservationsguy
40,Good for 1hr stroll in evening,"We visited this pier along with beach next to it in June-2017.- 2 families, 4 adults & 2 small kids - 5, 6 year old- after the beach fun, we strolled around the pier in evening after it got dark.- nice live music + sound of crashing waves..very soothing and fun- we didnt eat anything here- parking was ok, bit tight spots here due to limited space for a minivan. Do consider other parking options especially the beach as getting out of this parking lot at busy times can take ~10-15min+- decent restrooms",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sirsaini
40,Go to the very end for sea lions!,"Okay, this is a tourist trap of all tourist traps - but it's fun. If you go to the very end of the pier, you can see sea lions swimming around (which is so fun!) Avoid the garage if you can, some friends took 45 mins just to get out of the garage one day. We parked on the street by a meter and had no problem getting in/out. Great location to walk around, some fantastic street musicians there as well. We did not eat there, but the restaurant at the very end looked nice. Yes it's a tourist trap but $8 to play skee ball is a little excessive. ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julnilsmith
40,Nice view,The pier is a great place to take some photos and enjoy the beautiful view. There is a lot of restaurants around the area too. Nice place to take your kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/franciscoe348
40,Pier food,Went to Pier to kill a couple of hours and relax in the sun & sand and crisp ocean air! Had amazing food at The Albright:amazing bread bowl of clam chowder loaded with clams! Insanly yummy fish and chips! Worth the drive and parking is ample.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skinpro
30,"Stop and take some photos, but don’t plan a long stay.","We went on New Year’s Day- so was super crowded. We parked in a lot on 4th street and enjoyed the walk to the pier- it was cheaper and allowed us to see some of the area.Pros:Good photo placesGreat viewsMerry-go-round is very pretty - it’s inside. At the start of the Pier, not with the other rides.Cons:Large crowdsRun downArea around Pier is dirty with many beggars and homeless- gives it an unsafe feel.Overall, I am glad we stopped by, but was also disappointed. Checked this off our bucket list and moved on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kudzu773
40,Holiday,Visited Santa Monica Pier while on holiday.It is a nice area for a walk in the evening although it can be very busy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m-byrne-6
30,Bucket List Item,We came to see it as a part of an LA trip. It is iconic. The rides looked like fun and there were several shops but it looked sketchy traveling from Ocean Avenue due to beggars and homeless milling about. It’s likely safer for families during the daytime. Worth the visit but be cautious.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveller31792
50,Must see if in LA,"Right at the end of Route 66 this pier exists with an amusement park, beach surrounding both sides, restaurants, and of course a great atmosphere.The small amusement park is great for kids, there is also an older style arcade.The walk along the pier is great with live music playing at almost all times of the day.Must try the fresh fruit for sale! With chilli and salt, it’s the best! Genius!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R9192GBandrewl
50,Great place to take photos,"Amazing pier, better that the one in Santa Barbara. This is a place to visit with your family and little chindren. The pir have an attraction park (have to pay to enter) that iI recomend to visit in the night.The pier is a must to visit when you travel to L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/poshoo
30,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING !,"Maybe this place has history behind , maybe it colorful and picturesque but it sure is also full of homeless people , dizzy tourists , dirty places and horrible traffic .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tudorc923
50,Lively and fun!,"Even at 5pm in January, when its completely dark outside, this place is busy! We parked near the Pier, walked down to the end, and enjoyed all of the street entertainers dancing, singing, etc. We looked out over the ocean and across the coastline to all of the little lights in the distance and enjoyed the view! We bought a ticket and rode the Ferris wheel, which was worth the 10.00 per person! The views were awesome! We had so much fun and we were only there for an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Choolwhip
30,worth a quick walk,"kitschy, old pier, worth a quick walk out and back, didn't eat there so don't know how the food was, but something to do at night, vendors line the pier, about what you'd expect, still old-timey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/commcomm2
40,Wonderful place!,Santa Monica Pier is a must see place in Santa Monica! Try to go there early by 10AM as the parking would be extremely difficult to get in the afternoon. The pier has so many attractions for people with young children. Ferry's wheel and roller coaster are the biggest attractions for kids. There are a few good restaurants there too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sharif1470
40,New Years 2018,Overall good. Had more expectations. Lots of venders and music.It’s definitely a must do but don’t expect much. Parking is $15-$20.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/690ahmede
40,Fun,A very old place with attractions for all ages.Good restaurants and some shopping too.If it's your first time in LA you have to come.....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GuiAmaral
40,Still good to waste time here,"Came back here to remind our teenage kids of their visit 8yrs ago. The pier rides and amusement stalls are definitely better suited to kids under 10, but we all got a kick out of walking around again.We arrived at 1:00pm and couldn't see the end of the pier. A massive thick fog was everywhere and it was quite cool. We had come from Griffith Park for a swim, where it had been clear blue sky and really hot. It was eerily strange. So we walked around and walked down the beach towards Venice Beach and noticed the fog lifting. Still being on Australia time, we ended up going for lunch/dinner at Bubba Gumps about 3pm just as the fog lifted to again a clear blue sky. We luckily got a table right on the beach level western corner. It was very full, but it was fun watching the hawkers play set up and move cat and mouse, according to the police patrols. We were then treated to a gorgeous sunset as we were finishing our meals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sickaworkin
50,"Beautiful, Scenic Views; Incredibly Busy","A visit to Los Angeles brings up images of its iconic beaches. I found the beach views at Santa Monica Pier just incredible. But this is not a beach for the introverted looking to chill out. Instead, this is a super social beach with terrific foot traffic. There are people everywhere moving in every direction. For the most part, the garbage is disposed of properly, but there were times I came across the dubious smell of pee in places I did not want to smell pee....Also, the surrounding Santa Monica area is completely pedestrian friendly, with so many opportunities to travel by bike, skateboard, etc. Parking around this area was reasonable, but I would encourage visitors to come here in the morning for easier parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/573percivall
50,New Years Pacific Park 2018,"Well, Santa Monica lived up to all expectations. What more can you ask from an actual park on the pier?Our 16 & 10 year olds loved it with games & rides. Shops & entertainers everywhere but none were pushy.Water, Lights, laughter, Fun & enjoyment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shaunc311
20,Not great,Honestly thius is a tired old pier. Fairly sad old amusement park and so me tourist restaurants. More fun to be had grabbing a bike and riding the boardwalk. Needs a major update,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davido732
50,Refresh,Bring a bottle of water and some snacks when you stroll here.You will feel like you are in a painting with the awesome view.Be entertained with the local entertainers. Drop a dollar or more for the talents they share.Try wearing bright colors (uniform) if you are coming as a family( with small children) This helps in finding each other quickly.If you want to try fishing .. you will be blessed ( with a catch - if you are patient. ),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gerweiss
10,A letdown,"Not big at all! Dirty, trash everywhere, & nasty bathrooms. We did enjoy the bike trail though! But it was extremely crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristiewilson
50,Beach Fun,"Santa Monica Pier offered tons of fun for everyone. We had access to the beach, great restaurants, arcade room, rides, and nearby shopping pavilions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DJatan
40,Have to do it,Okay let’s start with the obvious it’s not that incredible but it still is somewhere you have to go when you’re in Los Angeles. You just have to go on a walk to the pier and on a sunny day it’s a treat and a free one :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Family5starTravel
30,Fun in a 'kiss me quick' hat sort of a way,"For those of a refined taste, look away now.The Pier is a Santa Monica institution and it's still fun in a typically tatty sort of a way. It does keep reinventing itself by way of different attractions, new eateries and things to do, so it's worth popping back every so often to see what has changed. Our kids loved it and the vendors (and hawkers) were all friendly and polite but - to coin a phrase - it is what it is. So accept it's a tourist trap, it'll be busy, you will spend money on rubbish you don't really want or need, and enjoy the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NBLondon
40,"Fun, festive atmosphere. Gorgeous ocean views.","Tip: Weekend parking can be a challenge as it gets super busy, consider side street parking a couple blocks away or pay a little to park in the Santa Monica Place mall or nearby parking structures and walk to the pier.Do not let the crowd deter you, there is probably not a better place to catch some of the most beautiful and gorgeous views of the Pacific Ocean and the Southern California coastline. The golden sunset views are particularly breath taking. Take your time to explore different parts of the pier, walk right to the end, there are so many different photo op spots.The colorful amusement park next to the pier, the many interesting shops and restaurants present a fun, festive atmosphere. Do hold on to little kids as it gets really crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iluv2eatntravel
30,Old & Tired,Everyone should visit the Pier at least once if for nothing else just to see where “ The Mother Road “ ends and meets the ocean! She has been here forever and despite trying to upgrade she is old and tired.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garnetth
30,A bit tired and cheap,"The pier is the same as before, nice views but the carny rides and games are a bit cheap. We enjoyed the plain piers in Manhattan Beach and Hermosa Beach much better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kato-Canada
40,A treat for the tacky tourist,"I would not normally consider myself a tacky tourist, but this is a visual icon of the SoCal coastline.I think it transcends tackyville if you start and finish by walking, biking or jogging from Venice beach - about 3 miles away.‘Twas a beautiful December Monday that my best friend and I capped off a great 5 day business / vacation trip with a stroll to the amusement park on the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pmcleanschmalz
40,Great sites too see but very busy.,It's a must if your in LA obviously it's packed with tourist but that's not surprising. There's lots to see and do and the views of the beaches are great!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joeyanna1234
20,Worth seeing once,"I’m not sure what all the hype is about this place. It is a tiny pier with some rides for kids. I guess being from the east coast I’m spoiled by all of the boardwalks with huge piers and tons of rides. Makes this look like your local parking lot carnival. Like I said, worth seeing once as there are great restaurants in the area and certainly good if you have small kids as older ones would be bored. Great to be there at sunset and then to watch the rides all lit up. Parking is easy at the pier but you’ll pay for it. Up the street at the top of the road on Colorado is a lot with the first 3 hours free. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rarphan2m
40,exactly what you would expect,"Just what you would think an american seaside pier would be like.Rides, souvenir shops, places to eat and get a coffee,do go as early as possible at the weekend as the crowds became enormous later after lunchtimeGood access for people with restricted mobility and walkway in to the town when you have had enough",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B3748GLmikef
40,A fun place to spend some time,"First off, give yourself time to park, the place is usually packed and if you can, park on the pier, it is cheaper than the surrounding beach lots and worth waiting in the line. Also nice to be able to get right in your car later in the evening. I have even parked on the pier when going to the beach and not the pier. Great views up and down the coast from Pacific Palisades to Point Dume in Malibu and on a clear day Catalina Island. Also a short walk to the 3rd street promenade in Santa Monica. Easy to make a full day at the pier if you desire or just a couple hours if walking and having a meal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kcslatts
40,Good for a few hours,"The pier itself is good for a few hours, has a few places to eat, a mini theme park and street entertainment. I would recommend a visit and then heading to Venice Beach to spend the rest of the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kovilan_Naidoo
50,Our USA honeymoon,"Very pretty and just what you see on tv.Plenty of tourists and so many things to see and do, everyone is there for the same reason to see the sights and take it all in. Do the ferris wheel and really enjoy the view.People were friendly,the homeless beggers are annoying",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danib83
40,Great Panoramic Views for Photos,"There are an unlimited amount of perfect photo spots on the pier, it is located right on the beach, but be sure to bring footwear as the sand tends to get scolding hot overall it was a great spot to walk and hang out for a few hours!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miodoll
40,Good fun but pricey,"Great attraction on the beach. The gondola ride is fantastic, great views of the area from up high but at $10 per person it really adds up for a family. The arcade games are extremely pricey at $5 a turn,Awesome to visit, just be selective about what you go on when you are there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KazzyK345

40,Lively place great spot,"There are rides on the peir and restaurants, the best part is watching all the performers that are playing, dancing, singing and whatever their talents are , throughout the day.. People fishing, people swimming , riding bikes, its a great lively spot to people watch and enjoy the nice long beautiful sandy beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coStalbert
50,A Classic,The Santamonica Pier is a classic. Most of the rides and restaurants have been updated and the prices are a lot higher than when I was a kid but the Carousel remains an affordable and beautiful and nostalgic attraction and is worth a trip every time I visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Happyowl97
40,Winter Stroll,"I visited the pier on Christmas Day. Little did i know that i wouldnt be the only person with that great idea; it was packed. It was a fun time though. Spent about two hours on the pier walking around with family. If you have little ones who dont like to walk, bring strollers. Plenty of amateur performers and souvenir shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tkwoods22

20,Old.,"Cool place to visit, but the reality is that this is an old dirty pier with homeless people perched at every exit. Credit the police presence that keeps things moving along. They did have the nicest parking attendant I’ve dealt with though!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J982QXcarlosp
40,Great time!,I enjoyed spending 1 1/2 hrs here. Liked walking down the whole pier and seeing the shops. Lots of food choices. Disappointed how much the rides cost so I didn't bother. Still had a nice time!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cdandoy

There’s something for everyone!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carlettems
40,Interesting place and lots of fun.,"Lots of rides, weird performers and lots to eat. There were many performers singing and dancing and entertaining the many visitors. I couldn’t believe how many people make their way to the Santa Monica Pier on the weekend. It was just crowded at night and cold. The age ranges from little kids playing games and enjoying the rides to grandparents and older. Lots of fun and an interesting place to visit. I was surprised to see many foreigners visiting the US.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/466carym

20,I think it’s had it’s day,The old pier looks like it’s had its day. Run down and the rides looked like they were very old. Markets were average and the only highlight was the view of the beaches. Sadly we were disappointed but ticked it off our list.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Essbie
50,Nice walk weather was perfect,"Visiting from Michigan in December the weather was beautiful. Find the parking closest to the pier if only walking around and shortly leaving, it’s $3 an hour. We payed $20 for an hour in the main rd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anariv313
20,Santa Monica pier,The pier is run down and sad. The stalls sell cheap market kitschy stuff. I believe this is a young tourist nightlife spot. It’s one redeeming feature is the beautiful beach and the walkway.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J4968YAdavidp
40,Great atmosphere,"My fiancé and i came here for some fun on our anniversary. We enjoyed the games and rides, but a lot of the snack vendors, like dip n dogs and popcorn, were closed, and since it was kind of like. Carnival, we felt we missed out on the carnival experience. Other than that, we had a lot of fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/558candacel

50,Modernized but keeps the traditional personality,"Viewed from the street, the Pier does not look like much. The Ferris Wheel is fun to watch at night. Once you go into the area, it really opens up with more attractions, rides, food, merchandise and personality than expected. Great for kids, families, dates.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Artsy12

50,Stroll Down The Pier,"We were trying to kill a little time before we headed off to the airport to fly home from our trip; and this was just the place to do it!There is so much hustle and bustle here, but not in an overwhelming sense. You can hear live music from extremely talented individuals, go fishing, grab a bite to eat at any of the restaurants/cafes, or just walk down to the beach (which is almost pure white sand) and enjoy the wide, open Pacific Ocean view.It was a perfect was to end our visit in California. We really hope to come back again soon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LauraHooker

This is la at its wackiest :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drmader
30,Super clean beach,"First time in Santa Monica I was assuming that there would be plenty of rides, they only had two. But has little shops along the pier and performers. The beach was beautiful and volunteers were cleaning it and it’s definitely kept up nicely. I’m still impressed how clean it was. It’s a nice little stop if you are around that area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wendalyh2017
50,Day at the Beach,"The Pier has a lot of history and it is big enough that it feels relaxed. And the large expanse of beach on both sides allows you to get away from it all.Or check out the gym with all its Horizontal bars, rings and tightropes, and watch. Or get in a workout. Lots of bike rentals and segways to make the pleasant but otherwise lengthy walk to Venice Beach a breeze.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/403mgm

30,Average venue / expensive,Thirty two fifty for an all day pass on some really basic rides!! We didn’t buy them. Ok value in the arcade especially for pinball or air hockey fans. Food was expensive and not too appealing. Boardwalk crowd and musicians made the atmosphere nice on a Friday evening,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marketsquirrel
50,Carnival vibes,"Long stretch of lovely beach. Along the pier, there’s games, Ferris wheel and restaurants and the atmosphere was very lively. The sea breeze makes it a nice getaway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leicalover
40,Nice Energy and Great Views,"Santa Monica is a fabulous beach, we really enjoyed our afternoon here. The pier is fantastic too; so many people, so much to do and such a good vibe. Great views from the end of the pier of the beach and coastline.There are guys selking ice cream, hot dogs, popcorn at al and lots of performance artists, especially on the landward end of the pier.So much energy here and a lovely place to spend a sunny day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bozeman-Dublin
20,Because you are in Santa Monica,"Had some time to kill because our flight arrived 5 hours before our hotel room was ready. So ws took some time out tp visit the pier.Nothing spectacular. Old, in need of repair. Plenty of homeless suffering from mental illness would make some people uncomfortable. Smell of cannabis is rife. And the stalls and shops are not worth your hard earned.Look, you go because it is a done thing to do. Take some photos and move along.Its only a 5 minute walk to the 3rd street market area.Food wise I didn't think it was worthwhile spending and $$$.Trip Advisor tip: Stay away from the park area. Its riddled with homeless and they WILL confront you for $$$. And get an uber or ride share if you need to travel there. It will save you about 50% over a taxi.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mike-5774
40,Day trip,"We came here for the day. Pier has the sort of arcade type stuff you’d see in the Uk, but was still fun. Beach was much nicer and warmer.Took a walk along the Ocean Front path which was really nice.Be aware that lots of stuff is shut on a Monday including the aquarium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmahK174EM
40,Not too crowded this time of year,"We strolled along the pier and found it to be very nice and not too crowded, but enough going on to make it worth visiting. The roller coaster and Ferris wheel weren’t running in the afternoon while we were there so check before you go what their running schedule is if that’s what you want to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LesleyGulledge
50,Must see,Went to the Santa Monica pier had a very good time took pictures walked around we went thru the week to avoid the weekend crowds Beautiful beach to enjoy....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teals121212
40,Cue everclear 🎶,"I mean it’s Santa Monica Pier... you’re somewhat obligated to stop by at least for a bit. I love going here at night to people watch, listen to the waves and the musicians playing on the pier and of course catch a great view. Grab a smoothie in venice and walk the path over to the pier. It’s maybe a thirty minute walk and way better than getting a taxi.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThebestofKendell
40,Bit of family fun!,We had a great evening trying out a few of the rides on the pier. The view from the Ferris wheel was great and the roller coaster fun. We then had a meal at Bubba Gumps -yum!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JOA09
50,A great place to relax,"This place is so beautiful. You could wear a bathing suit soak up the sun on the beach or wear something comfortable & enjoy the board walk. It's a mini theme park on the pier, so kids of all ages are welcome. Live bands & singers. You have painters, balloon makers, dancers & all types of entertainment out there. The food is phenomenal. I don't recommend the gift shop because the prices are ridiculous. The pier normally have sea lion sightings--I was lucky to see a few while I was there. It's great for a date night, family outing or just a place to clear your mind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mercedes909
40,Fun place for a day visit,Fun for a day! Great place to watch the sunset. Typical junk food available plus nearby restaurants are very good. Clean environment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/521sheah
30,Overrated,We visited LA and I wanted to see what the hype was for the Santa Monica pier. Parking was $7. The pier was nothing special for me. This would be a good place to bring kids. The pier had a lot of games and rides like a carnival would. Lots of little knick knack shops.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/875meaganl
40,A must do if you've never been to Santa Monica,Great for a family day out or lunch by the water at Bubba Gumps. Parking on site and heaps to do. Wander and take pics or get involved on the rides. Tuna of fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mmoo73

Bring your sunscreen, grab a cool drink and enjoy the unusual.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y9231GWchrisp
50,Great vibes for people watching and feeling the culture,"The pier is a great place to come solo, with friends, your significant other or fam! Although it is touristy - it is great time. The pier offers talent and artists like no other, great food options and of course, a great view of the ocean and mountain range. Hit 3rd street within walking distance for more great shops and food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hannahmA9199SF
50,Don't Miss if You're in LA Doing the Beach Thing,"Brilliant. An absolute must if you're near the beaches in LA. We were here late on a Sunday night, 2300-0000, and the pier had a real vibrant feel to it. People were out enjoying themselves and making full use of the pier's amenities. Lots to do here...even if it's just people watching. Be sure to check out the arcade, choker block with all your retro favourites.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dude_76125
50,Fun place to spend some time,"Have been coming here since I was a kid. Still drive up from San Diego a few times a year to visit and walk the pier, eat at the restaurants and people watch. Many changes over the years so always seems like something new to see when I visit. Great for photography as well. Fun for families and people of all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Geekette92064
50,Just a whole lot of fun,"Fabulous from up close or even afar, particularly at night when the lights really bring it alive. Beautiful. Look out for regular live music concerts. They add another dimension. Fun place Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kgnof1977
10,Not Pretty or well maintained... Carpark overwater!,"Santa Monica Pier is not pretty, has no connection to the environment and is something that is more disappointing than enjoyable. It's almost like a car park overwater.Overall if you visit Santa Monica you will likely visit the pier as part of having a beachfront walk, however it is underwhelming.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/griffon_remy
50,Cool place for Christmas at the beach! Connects to the boardwalk!,"Great place to go with family and friends! Cool light show! The pier is located very close to Main Street, Venice Beach, and 3rd Street Promenade! The boardwalk is good day or night! If you are a people watcher it is a cool place for you too! Pet-friendly everywhere except the beach and fun in the sun or evening! Walk or ride bikes to it all! 👍🏽👍🏽",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yehbut
40,End of Route 66,"Yes, it is an icon for road trips. We drove a Corvette for a bit of Route 66 in California and Arizona, toured up the Pacific Coast and made a picture stop at Santa Monica pier. Breezy, cool and restful.Not much to eat or buy there. It is a spot that marks completion of a sports car touring. It is an accomplishment in life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dudeman8
40,Very cool,"What an awesome idea and place. I'm sure this is not that special to someone who lives by the ocean but to this inland travel Santa Monica pier is a one stop shop of cool. First of all the beach. The ocean is right there with the powdery beach. A great place to sit and relax and talk in some rays. Also, they have swing sets, ring swings, places to rent bikes and ropes to test your balance. So, you have the option to relax or be a little active. They have an aquarium below the pier. The pier itself has all kinds of fun. They have an amusement park with a roller coaster, Ferris wheel, several skill games to win prizes. Burger shops, coffee shops, fishing. Soda jerks. Pretty everything to keep you entertained all day. The most unique thing I saw was this pier was the end of the old Route 66 hwy. so they have an old shop and several things dedicated to the history of this highway. History buffs will love I'm sure. Can't wait to go back here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisaE4425XW
30,Nice view of the water!,Had a decent time just walking and people watching. Didn’t ride anything and not sure of the prices but the parking was very reasonable! Vendors along the pier selling things but not super pushy! Just a short walk to the mall,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/damckin_99
50,Nice ferry carnival with grubs,Took an Uber from our hotel in Venice beach to the pier.Good to have carnival feel after dark and also get the vibes and soul of the city with basker-like boardwalk entertainment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bennylimlee
50,It must be done,"Though a massive cliché and totally derivative, you still must make this trip to the Lourdes of LA. Long live the Ferris wheel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrissB2733LD
30,watch out,"nice and relaxing place. Just atch out from the crooks at the pier on the route 66 shop, they always try to take advantage of tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/filippog816
50,Amazing beach,First time goin to the pier the rides were not to bad. The creativity that was expressed in the board walk was amazing. The view of the beach and Santa Monica from the Pier was simply beautiful. I will certainly return to see the pier again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jusanuff
40,Mostly closed on Mondays (apparently),"Nice place to visit, but it was pretty dead on Monday evening. Not sure if that's always the case, or just that one day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bhcastle
40,Gorgeous views,"Beautiful pier with amazing views all aroundGood place for a coffee a sit down and take in the breathtaking views, also some good entertainment on the pier",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T3489KJlaurad
50,Nice enjoyable time,"There’s not really a lot too do around the pier, unless you go onto the beach or you’re inclined to visit the funfair/theme park although if you haven’t got some young children in tow you’ll probably give the latter a miss.This pier is great way to burn some time, enjoy the world around you, and watch the beach life (although that gets boring after a few minutes!)There’s plenty of shops and a few eating places on here, but beware you’ll definitely be paying a premium for anything on here!Overall though, it’s definitely a good place to spend around half a day or so (for some, even less than that)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fiammanera1197
50,A perfect weekend trip,"The Santa Monica pier was the high light of our weekend trip. The pier was clean, and not crowded when we went that day. The weather was perfect for walking. Was able to take nice pictures and enjoy the view. A lot of restaurants and souvenir shops too. There is a arcade too. When u plan to visit Santa Monica you have to visit the pier. Enjoy your trip",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/am0urf
40,Iconic,Anywhere close to this area you must walk the pier just because and get your picture by the end of Route 66 sign!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susan-lincoln

30,Typical Tourist Attraction,"Getting there is easy and no problem parking ($2) Just not that much to see. Lots of seagulls and an occasional pelican. T shirt vendors, knick-knacks and souvenir shops. Bubba Gump shrimp had a 25 minute wait (which we didn't).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stan2nM
50,Good vibes,Santa Monica Pier is very relaxing and over the years attracts more people and has gotten bigger with restaurants and shops like El Torito here and the small shops that are exclusive to the beach life.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cordica1
50,Fun place,"We were there with a group of friends and all our teenage daughters. We hung out on the beach for awhile and then made our way to the pier. We stopped for cotton candy and ice cream. We only had time for one ride, so we chose the roller coaster. It was a lot of fun! There were a lot of activities to choose from and plenty of food stops. A great way to spend an afternoon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Momof4Girls23

50,Great visit!,"The weather is great, the views are awesome and there are several food locations here including Bubba Gump Shrimp and Pier Burger. The shops are a little pricey but you're paying for the view and location so it's understandable. I would like to come back here in the near future and spend more time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VegasKhan
40,Absolute fun for all ages,"The pier is full of life, food, rides and frivolity. The ferris wheel offer spectacular views of the California coast line. This is also the end of route 66. Great photo opportunities and carnival games to choose from",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wetsuitdrymartini
40,Santa Monica Pier Carousel,"The carousel is the perfect place for AFM cocktails. I went here with my Heattwave Productions colleague every night of the AFM for carousel cocktails, and it was great fun.I recommend going to the pier in the day, or early evening, as crime can be a problem there. A woman got shot at the pier the same evening we where there. Unfortunately gun violence is an everyday problem in America, so use common sense. Visit this place with a friend or family member, and try to leave before it gets too late...especially on the weekend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JonathanHeatt
50,Just like in TV!,"The pier didn't disappoint. Street performers, live music, lots and lots of people make this place wonderful.Restaurants and bars were packed and it created an amazing atmosphere.We also rented bikes and had a ride to the Venice beach and back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariolal776
40,Pretty view of Pacific,"Neat place with restaurants, rides, and entertainers. You have a great view of the ocean from the end of the pier. We were there at sunset and got great pics. We spent about 2 hours there and that was enough. Glad I got to see it, but prob wouldnt visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackiJo

30,Has to be seen but a bit trashy really!,"It was great to see this Pier as it’s so famous. However, the tourist trap is evident. There are lots of beggars and buskers and souvenir shops and not a lot else. We went on the Ferris wheel which was great - but otherwise it wasn’t anything to write home about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJB78
50,What a view,The view was absolutely beautiful. Weather was great able to walk along beach and pier. Unfortunately the smell of urine was all around every bench and the site of homeless people was very sad.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O4581CIdonnal

40,Interesting with good views,"I walked up and down the pier about 3 times and had a good time. The views of the beaches and surrounding areas were good, especially at sunset. Most of the entertainers were excellent and worth watching/listening to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VictoryMal

There are several restaurants, as well as, food stands. You'll find some talented street performers and artists. Great for people watching! Grab an ice-cream coneand just enjoy the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joman833
40,You have to watch the sunset here,Go on a weekday which should be less crowded and parking at the location is much easier. Watching the sunset here is a must so check the twilight and sunset hours and make sure you arrive beforehand and get a good spot!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Canucks301
50,Iconic historical site.,Came there as a child and it hasn't changed too much in 60 years other than the addition of the amusement park. The carousel is still there as well as the fishing area at the end of the pier. A true trip down memory lane!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/632deirdreh
30,"Overrated, but check it out if it interests you","We were at the pier in the Summer for vacation and again in November while in town for a wedding. In my opinion, it is loud, over commercialized and over crowded. However, I realize that some people really like this type of atmosphere. If it is your cup of tea, then I am sure you will have a great time.I will say that walking on the beach just south of the pier was very enjoyable and not as crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasoncG6425VD
30,OK for a quick pass-through,"This was not quite what I expected-- a little seedy, the usual T-shirt and souvenir shops and carnival- type food with a ferris wheel and a small roller coaster. I guess I had the impression it was more extensive and up-scale. Plenty of buskers looking for money. It's fine for a quick up-and-down walk but that's about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Midwesterner88
50,Great place,"Awesome place to walk around and hang out. Great veiws of ocean, beach and mountains.

40,...not really what I imagined but....,"The whole atmosphere wasn't really what I had expected...maybe it seemed smaller or something...BUT, definitely glad we checked it out! It was definitely entertaining...we took our pic by the ""end of Route 66"" sign (actually there are quite a few photo opts)....the artists are interesting (some are really good)...variety of food choices (from Bubba Gumps to a hot dog on the Pier)...of course the normal touristy shops. It's nice to walk out on the pier and to look at the coast. A lot of interesting people with interesting pets too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dawnc763
40,Worth a visit!,"You can’t go to LA and the beach without visiting Santa Monica Pier. The historic end of the Route 66 trail as well as an area packed with amusements, rides and food. Great for kids and big kids alike but not overly large, so it can be ticked off in a few hours. The area is gorgeous by day, right over the beach, but is also beautiful to visit at night. Food options are your normal takeaway-type fare foods, but there is a decent variety.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mykindofawesome
30,Great but don’t go on weekends with kids,The area may be trashed by Friday night and Saturday night partiers. I would not recommend taking kids on a Saturday or Sunday morning as lots of alcohol bottles and trash laying around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BlueSki3s

30,"Must see during your visit, but...","Must see during your trip. Iconic. Agreed. Worth a ‘short’ visit but unsure you need more than one visit and perhaps 60-90 mins max. Decent burger joint at front end (see other review of Pier burger) and not much else - absent a few carnival rides and a couple of other food options. Younger kids will certainly enjoy. Was underwhelmed by the beach, as a matter of fact, water was deemed unsafe to swim the day after Thanksgiving. Other drawback is a rather narrow path that serves as main ‘entrance’ on and off.Happy we got to see it for sure!I’d make it a visit but a short one...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Markpicc

50,Beautiful area,We arrived right at sunset and it was gorgeous! Walked down to the ocean and stuck our toes in the water even though it was soooo cold!

20,Too kitsch and unappealing,"Sadly the pier was not my cup of tea. Very pretty to see it at night, all lit up, but by the light of day it’s just lined with stalls peddling their wares to tourists.

Crowded yes- but walk all the way down to the end of the pier and you'll get some elbow room. Plus a stunning 180 degree ocean view and the romance of ""LaLa Land"" brought to life. Day or night.

50,Must see when at LA,"the very end of route66if you want the traditional baywatch feeling, with souvenir shops and street attractions visit this placetry Bubba gump at the front end for a schrimp meal also",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Balazs123456
40,Neat and vibrant,Great to see so many people enjoying a community icon. Lots of sights and sounds for the casual stroller plus a year round amusement park. Parking at the base of the pier is $10 flat rate for the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/702billh
40,Sand and ocean - what more could you want?,"I loved this place. The pier made me feel nostalgic, with its tasty seafood and old-timey amusement park. We walked from the Pier to Venice Beach in the soft white sand beach, with our feet in the water, and back along the boardwalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TRIPTravelTailor
50,I think it is coolest place on earth.,"Trip down by Metro and a short walk to the pier via reasonable food outlets. The pier has everything. Stalls, loos, trapeze, big wheel, funfair, singers, mime artists, craft stalls and an ambiance to die for. It overlooks Baywatch beaches and wild life. Pelicans,Terns Dolphins and Sealions can all be seen With a travel fishing rod I caught mackerel . Fishermen were helpful and talkative. A Sealion had half of one fish I caught.A beautiful and atmospheric place to spend a day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tonyisleham
30,Worth a look!!,Nice place to go for a stroll but very busy. It is just a pier with some novelty rides. Very much geared up for tourists.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yolreg
30,Where’s Snooki,"We visited with family early in the day. No rides were open yet but that was ok. My brother in law advised that they don’t come down there at night. After experiencing the cast of characters we encountered during the early afternoon I understand why he doesn’t go there at night. For those familiar with seaside heights NJ, it was a smaller west coast version. We got some great boardwalk photos with the family and moved on to something else.O yea the smell of the Devils lettuce was quite pungent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mpg3061
50,Santa Monica Pier is more than you can imagine,I’ve been to Santa Monica Pier in November. In this trip I was with my wife and our two kids. We simply love this place. The environmental is incredible and The Pier is amazing. Next to the Pier there are lots of restaurants and stores. You and your family can walk on the beach sidewalk and see beautiful and happy people enjoying the good life of California.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Valdirarnaldo
40,Classic visit.,"Really nice visit - should definitely be a part of your trip. Rides, food, and of course the beach. Nice little afternoon for families.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmasc1
40,Visit to Santa Monica Pier,My wife and I recently visited Santa Monica Pier with friends while in LA preceding a cruise. We rented a car and drove to this famous landmark. It is a nice area with nice shops on the streets adjoining the pier. There was also some nice craft vendors in the area. The Pier was a nice walk with plenty of things to see. The beach was full of people surfing and sun bathing. There was also volleyball players on the beach. There were a number of people fishing from the pier as well. This was a nice experience and we were glad we went.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmacch
40,Fun place to visit,"Great place to visit on a summers day, plenty of activities and nice views. Great ice cream stalls and fish shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ripitup2014
20,Not impressed,"Having been to SoCal many times over the years, I have never been to Santa Monica Pier, but have always wanted to go. Well I can finally say, I went,and now I probably won't go again. There is a lot of history there, but it is a total tourist trap. When I'm in the SoCal area, I frequent Laguna Beach, and Seal Beach. After SMP, Laguna and Seal are a lot better. The boarwalk was so packed, you could hardly walk. Trash everywhere. I don't mind homeless people, or even begging, but when they are yelling at you, and/or urinating on the boardwalk and beach that's where I have a problem. I only rode the roller coaster, because of the history, but I didn't ride any of the other rides.The boardwalk had signs everywhere NOT TO FEED THE BIRDS, yet everyone was doing it. One lady was placing bread on her head, lap, and chest area, and had pigeons literally landing and sitting on her eating the bread off of her body! With all of those birds, there were bird droppings all over the boardwalk. The beach was less packed, but a lot of litter and debris scattered the beach and water. Bubba Gump, and some other restaurants are on the boardwalk. Lot's of stores for shopping or souvenirs line the boardwalk. If you plan on driving and parking, pack some patience. I didn't drive or park there, but it looked like a mess. Long lines to get in and out of the pier, and the parking lot. Like I said, I'm glad I finally had the chance to visit, but I probably won't be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RainbowLieberman
40,Nice Walk @ Night,"with the neon lights. This iconic pier is a great spot to go walkabout at sunset. Take in the ocean air, beachfront views and marvelous sun setting over the Pacific. I think that this pier is a must-have-a-wander attraction when on the Westside...again preferably at sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HaljoHal
30,Worth seeing - ONCE,"This is a high draw-card for new visitors & tourists to the area and I would say a ""MUST DO"" if only ONCE because of its Famous name and Historic attributes. To be able to say you have been there, done that is a tick off the bucket list.Unfortunately, don't believe the fair/carnival is that great & there aren't many things to do or look at. Having said that, I am happy that I can say (with my photos), that I have experienced this world famous location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristinaMCGM
40,nice at night,"Went for a short stroll. Got a few hundred yards. Kicked the ball back toward the road and called it a night. The boards make that distinct sound every time you walk on them. Cars are permitted, so there's another, much larger sound - however similar.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tomskatesnyc
30,Unimpressed,I didn't really think it was worth it due to the amount of people and the traffic. It really isn't all that much to see or do on the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DEkholm
20,I love hate the pier,"The pier and its attractions are a must. It is touristy, campy, good fun. I have been coming to the pier since 1979. My hesitation is in the last several months the area has deteriorated tremendously. A lot of trash and waste on the beach and on the streets. Also some very angry and disgusting homeless people. I really do not mind the yelling or begging, but in 5 days I watched several urinate and or defecate on the boardwalk. Hey, Santa Monica - get yourself cleaned up, please.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lawrenceburkef
50,Holiday,We went here to spend the day but it was a place where I would say we only spent a few hours. Glad to say we went but not overly impressed it had a feel of history about it though. It was a nice pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanL146
40,A cozy but very touristy place,This is where the legendary route 66 ends and the ocean begins. There are tons of street performers here and interesting shops. Not a place where I'd spend a ton of time but it's definetly great for a few hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindkvast
40,Iconic so must see if in Santa Monica,"Santa Monica Pier is a wide jetty but not very long. Iconic because its in the movies. Lots of tourist and souvenirs to purchase. Great atmosphere with the show rides, it's a must visit if you have time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/acmp7577
30,Santa Monica Pier,"If you visit Los Angeles, you have to visit Santa Monica Pier. One of California's surfing communities and a great place to crash on the beach or walk the pier. The pier has some small carnival style restaurants and a few souvenir shops but a great atmosphere. A few singer-song writers set up on the pier and perform. Some of them are actually very good. Then you have some of the harmless, bizarre type that can be entertaining in their own way! The kids loved them enough to video them so they were funny! You have to do the pier rollercoaster or the wheel just to say you did it. There over-priced but offer a great view of the ocean and beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bdy328
40,Typical and funny,"Worth the visit.Nice view from Santa Monica Beach. And exotic street artistsInside parking lot is not big, but cheaper than external ones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wagnerm520
30,Very Crowded,"We went here after our plane landed at LAX. It was too early to check in so we thought we would go check it out.It was very crowded. There's not really much to do. There were some rides. The rides were expensive and crowded. There were a few souvenir shops but they didn't seem to have much to choose from.We walked to the end of the pier took some pictures and returned to our car. I don't know think we were there more than an hour. Now that I've seen it, I have no reason to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PPooh72
30,Very touristy but a bit of fun,The Santa Monica Pier is a bit of a tourist trap with junky souvenirs and average food but it comes to life at night and it's a nice spot to watch the sun go down. It can be a bit smelly on hot days.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carlief2015
30,Bit Average if I'm honest.,"Went here with two friends, did the roller coaster, checked out the Arcade, but that's really all there is. Seems a bit run down and like it needs some TLC. Would still go just to say you have been but you really only need to spend like 30 mins here and is it worth paying $7 for the parking?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KelvinR749
20,Boring,There are much more interesting things to see in LA than the pier. It’s a brisk and boring walk. I cant understand why anyone would give it more stars,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Voyager736382
50,A must-visit!,"A must-see for anyone visiting Santa Monica! Between the food, rides and the people-watching, there’s always a great time to be had at the pier! Try going on the weekdays to avoid huge crowds. And don’t forget to check out the awesome Ferris wheel!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kdavidl
30,Throwback to yesteryear,A healthy crowd of day trippers enjoying the hazy Californian sunshine. The pier is stuck nostalgically in the 70's at a push the 80's.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatOC1967
50,Great place to spend a few hours,"The pier is quite long and has restaurants, amusements, views, fishing, etc. There is parking but I travelled by light rail from LA. It was a great day trip. Recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samcevoy
30,Not really much to see,"So this was one stop that we can now check off our bucket list.....really nothing special to see. We parked right there for $10 and walked the pier. We probably would have gone on the Ferris wheel if it were open, but we were there Sunday morning and nothing was running. On the plus side, the public bathrooms were surprisingly clean!! Probably why I rated this place 3 stars....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1979Traveler
30,It's alright,"So if you like crowds, amusement parks, and tourist traps, then you'll enjoy it here. I came here as a college student who had little money, hate for roller coasters, and dislike of crowds...so it definitely wasn't the place for me. My friend and I actually ended up chilling underneath the pier which was actually quite fun to see the waves roll in. There were street magicians which were fun to watch and a lot of bathrooms. do it at least once so you can say you've done it:)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilykf97
50,Nice place,Nice walk and areaAlot of places there for lunch or dinner and to walk around the area and beach ... the pier is very nice as well ... recommended,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/351mom

40,Nice spot to visit. Great a night too.,"First place I visited in LA. Great view on the sea, nice atmosphere. Was great to be there and recognise a place seen in so many movies. Just great to wonder by the sea, have a drink or too, a bite, and just relaxe and appreciate LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteevoNuissier
50,Very nice,"Friendly place, very crowded, not much to do beside to see the view..Make sure you have a coat with you cause in the evening it's getting cold",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atnellys
40,Very nice area to spend with family,"Fun place with lots of activities. Specially with kids it will be more fun. Water, beach, and outdoor entertainments.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aligreendxb
50,"Awesome fun, give yourself a treat","Always a must visit when in Santa Monica, fun activities, rides and entertainment. Street or rather ‘pier’ performers who are truly entertaining. An iconic Santa Monica land mark that doesn’t disappoint.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pamc578
30,Worth a quick visit but 1-2hours more than enough,"This is an iconic location but not much to do so plan it as part of a third street promenade, main street, beach time, type of visit. You will only need an hour tops to see this location",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChezCarrere
50,Good vibe!!,"This pier has a super good vibe full of music bands and park attractions. If you had been in Brighton pier (in the UK), well it is very similar but with the most amazing weather. The beach is a proper sandy beach. We rent bikes in a place just outside the pier and went along side all the path which takes you from Santa Monica to Venice beach. This activity I really recommend it! it is the perfect thing to do to feel the proper Californian vibe... Definitely, you should visit this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catheriner201
50,My kids grew up loving 'Santa Monica pier',And onetime a while ago- it was my first trip out with a new baby in a stroller and my 5 year old son had ran ahead too fast in the crowd within seconds after I panicked and was yelling my sons name security was there in a flash and found him so it's really a safe place even though it is extremely busy - the kids love it - great day out for everyone :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmarQ2878SK
50,Must experience,If you have a day to spend in Los Angeles or the Santa Monica area you must go to the pier a lot of vendors very entertaining and a lot of souvenirs to choose from.exciting day for all ages,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tjsandra
40,Interesting Must Do....but Don't Go on a Weekend Evening Unless You Like Crowds,"We walked down to the Pier twice during our stay. It was really busy but people watching was more than a bit fun - but in general nothing unique. We did not go on any of the rides, but many kids were running around and appeared to be having fun. We did not eat - and the food was really expensive. But, it was fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U1628QJmatthewh
30,Side trip after USC,"It was a beautiful Saturday and an afternoon at the beach was our chosen activity. Pier was not crowded and it was very pleasant. Beach is nice, again not crowded. As with any tourist area you have to be mindful of theft. Happened to witness an older gentleman take someone’s unattended boots.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/986jaynei
50,Way cool!!,Was our first time visiting Santa Monica amd the pier. We had so much fun! My mom really liked being there and enjoyed the games arcade too haha. Lot to do from dining to a marine aquarium to learn abit about the sea life that from the area and literally able to touch certain sea life creatures. Worth it. Mom realllllly wants to visit again. See you soon Santa Monica,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnathank299
50,Fantastic Atomosphere,"First time visiting here and what a great atmosphere even tho it was a week day. Such a big pier to be able handle heaps of tourists which creates a great vibe. There are some tourist souvineer shops, food and drink outlets and restaurants on the pier plus the famour Amusement Park. A great place to stroll around and take in the view. An absolute a must to visitParking available and easily reached with public transport",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Livetotravel747
40,"If in LA, stop by here for a mini theme park experience.","Plenty of movie scenes and commercials have been shot here so if on the west side of LA, this is a fun place to stop by. This is not a full theme park, simply a Boardwalk with some small rides.Time: You won't need to spend much time here. Probably under 2 hours.Traveler Tip: Great place for a date night with your significant other or to take the family. Not too far away is 3rd Street Promenade which has plenty of dining and shopping.I'm a fellow traveler so I appreciate when other people have given me tips.

50,I got engaged here!,"I love this place, it was amazing walking the beach and then my boyfriend proposed to me and I love this place even more, the beach was clean and the park is pretty cool. We ate and had some drinks at the Mexican restaurant here and we enjoyed it a lot. There was also a lot of great talent on the pier, I highly recommend going here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vacationjunkie2387
30,Really needs a makeover and some security,"The pier is an amazing historical place.Looks absolutely breathtaking as you approach.Out on the pier is pretty dirty and full of hawkers trying to sell their wares.Performers were worth stopping and tipping.The walk along from parking to the pier is full of homeless and junkies though, so be careful. Would not recommend a visit after dark unless carrying.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tyler-family-aussie
40,Alternative to airport waiting,"It is is a great alternative to go there if you have a long flight and you had to wait in the airport. You can have great views of the ocean, great walk, shopping or restaurants. A good place to kill time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/experto11
40,Iconic spot,Very well maintained beach despite the horde of homeless people who call it home. The beach area itself was well groomed and the boardwalk kept clean- The kiddie rides are always a hit while Bubba gump is there to satisfy your shrimp craving and a smattering of small shops. A must visit if you are in the coast..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kundiman
50,Good fun time here with my girlfriend,"Ferris wheel and other fun fair rides to enjoy, lots of buskers and fun people. Nice stroll and sit in the sun enjoying the sea air and views",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DerbyPhilip
50,Must visit place when you are in LA..,"The place is outstandingly beautiful and the most beautiful times are early in the morning or sunset time when the sun goes in sea and the entire environment is very much energetic, most beautiful thing is unlike other beaches it has lot of activities for kids and for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gauravs129
20,Disappointed,"Admittedly is was off season but there really is not much here. A few food stands, gift shops and some non operational rides. The beach beside did look very nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Richy_Bobby
50,Birthday weekend getaway,Stopped by to check out the famous Santa Monica Pier! It was such a great place to bring your family. There are rides and arcade for the kids. The views of the ocean are beautiful. There are vendors selling stuff and there are several restaurants as well. There is a fee to park which wasn’t a big deal. We had a great time walking around enjoying the views and people watching.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chrispreyes0511
30,Kinda of cool,"It was neat to see this but once is enough. Lots of people, little shops of course with tourist stuff and the rides definitely oriented towards little kids. Fun to say I have been there, seen it, but not something I would feel like I had to return to. Santa Monica itself if gorgeous...do the pier, rent a bike and enjoy the great flat trails along the beach or get the Bird App and rent a motorized scooter. Super fun!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonna242
50,Great time with family,"Beautiful beach, fun people and great vibes. Plenty of photo opportunities and things to do with family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CalvinFoster
50,Disappointed... at my friends,Went double dating to Santa Monica pier and was not allowed to go on rides or fully experience it. Smh but I was dam impressed. It's a fair on top of a pier on top of an ocean.!! Lots of cool vendors from what I was able to see. Just go. Find out. Live what I couldn't.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/osmarai
40,Great place for a visit,"Went to the amusement centre, a lot of old school games that brought back a lot of memories. The theme park I would defn try next time when I bring the kids over. Walking down there are street performers that were quite entertaining. The pier is kept pretty clean and the view of the coastline is pretty amazing. There seems to be two car parks. The one crossing the bridge is closer to the pier (convenient for strollers and wheelchairs) whilst the below street level carpark requires stairs and a short walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skiski833
50,Loved it!,"Loved the pier, gets quite busy with both locals and tourists. Take a look around before you spend your money with a vendor, you'll probably see it elsewhere cheaper... especially with anything to do with Route 66...Take care when using the photobooth... the backgrounds for selection is not the pier itself (as is advertised on the side of the photobooth).Very fun, couple, family, and travel-group friendly.Foodie trucks available up on the main road (cheaper than food in the restaurants and eateries on the pier).TipsUse Uber to go everywhere in the States. It's so much cheaper than a taxi... (Sorry Taxi Driver people!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AznEmpress
50,Good day at the beach,We had an enjoyable day at the pier. Did not go on any of the rides. Good photo opportunities and nice to sit on the sand with the kids enjoyed playing in the water. Buy your letter names here rather than at Disney and save up to $50!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RM0100
10,Misrepresented,"This place does not live up to the hype. Over priced across the board, save your money and go to universal studios instead! $40.00 per person for “unlimited “ rides or $8.50 per ride ( usd ) is a bit steep considering there are like 6 rides. Very sad that it wasn’t like it was portrayed",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trippingx3
30,A good pier,"This was an ok place to go. I’d heard tons of great reviews and recommendations, so I must admit I was a little disappointed, it wasn’t somewhere I’d want to stay long. It’s got an arcade and some rides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gemmat570

40,"Relaxing, beautiful and people watching","It is not only the pier that you should visit. You should walk down to venice beach along the path and even up the other end towards Malibu. There is a path with an underpass, which comes up to a small street leading you up the hill. You will arrive at a place where you will see a lot of people exercising on steps (over 100 steps). If you are lucky, you can even catch sight of celebrities exercising as well. From there, you can head straight back up towards 3rd street prominade. Lots of walking for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YNL127
40,After dinner stroll,"A beautiful place to see street acts, play at the fair or just stroll and watch the seals play in the sea. Beautiful sunsets as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vinniethespark
40,You Gotta Go There,"Santa Monica Pier is just another boardwalk but it is an iconic must visit. The boardwalk is small compared to many others, like Coney Island. It is a bit run down and you see the homeless hanging out there. But, there is a wide variety of carnival foods as well as small eateries and Bubba Gump's restaurant. There are rides, a ferris wheel, arcade, performers, artists, and people selling their wares. A little bit of fun for all ages. The place is crowded and the atmosphere is electric. Most of all, its the best place to view the full expanse of ocean and beach. Come early and see the sunrise or come later and enjoy all of the lights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swok13
30,Afternoon walk,"It's a cool place to walk around, not that many spots to stop and enjoy some food etc but the pier is cool to walk around, done it once, got the photos and saw the old zephyr shop but other than that, unsure if I would visit twice",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hatha101086
20,Over Hyped,"Pier is looking run down and unkept. Noticed several empty locations. Couple of rides, and places to grab a bite. Good for a couple of photos but only if you are going to spend the day a th e beach other wise the pier by its self is not worth the $15-20 parking fees seen at more than a few lots. If your driving be prepared for the traffic, skateboarders and bicycles. Conjested and very tight quarters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/waylonc853
50,Another iconic location!,"We had to stop at the Santa Monica Pier! We went super early in the morning and watched the sunrise! If you're looking for some peace and good picture taking - I would recommend doing this in the AM. We parked right at the entrance to the pier, and basically had the pier to ourselves! (minus a couple early morning fishermen!)I could see how the pier would be lots of fun during the day as well, lots of rides and places to eat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jend859
50,Great place for family,We visited twice on vacay ..tge viewd abd tge ocean was amazing..one day was hit and tge other day we went was cold..but we still enjiyed ourselves..its definitely a different atmosphere which I like,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/860dnr

40,Vacation,The pier was fun had a few games and rides and a beautiful view over looking the ocean. Loved the street performances by locals singing and or dancing. Big Deans is a hole in the wall bar with food right next to the pier. This is a dive with really good food and local craft beer. If you want a local experience it is a must.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keithpowell0429

30,Just OK,"I had been to the Santa Monica Pier the last time I was in California many years ago and decided to go back. Was quite disappointed in the pier this time. It was crazy, crazy crowded even though it was near 100 degrees. It's definitely a tourist spot and the parking lot was full even by 10am. Views from the pier were beautiful, but the smell was really bad. The water was brown with kelp/seaweed every where and it smelled. I don't remember it smelling like this last time I was here, but there was definitely a foul smell and I believe it was coming from the water. Pier is a tourist spot and is terribly over crowded. You wouldn't catch me swimming in the brown water here...I think you can actually see the brown water from one of my pictures. Blech.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbrenz
40,Street theater to the max!,"Music, jugglers, costumes, food, mementos, crowds, all together on the Pacific. This is street life/theater at its finest and weirdest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Unsatisfiedguest2013
50,Must Visit!,"Came to Santa Monica about a week ago while I was in L.A and I really enjoyed it. This is a must see spot if you visit L.A you have to visit Santa Monica. The pier itself is smaller than I thought doesn't take long to explore but the atmosphere is a lot of fun, specially if you have kids. We parked in the lot for $12 all day parking and it was better than finding a street parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/404gretell
50,Great experience!,"Persuaded my husband to ride the Ferris wheel with me, and we both loved it! Views were amazing, and lovely, relaxing ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EnglandLoulou
50,The Ferris Wheel Rocks!!!,We just took a week vacation and visited Santa Monica Pier. It was a awesome experience. There's lot's of games to play and you can easily win the kids stuffed animals. We rode the Ferris wheel and it was a little pricey but the views were awesome. There are some strange people here so keep your kids close but overall it's a pretty cool place to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Momof2lovestraveling
50,Santa Monica pier is great,"We stayed at the Shore Hotel across the street from the pier, we took a walk over to the pier and I was very surprised to find so much going on. There was street performers, carnival rides, food vendors, restaurants and all in a very family friendly safe environment.It's great place to go for a date night too.We had a great time and will be going back again",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/66willieb
40,A postcard location,The entrance to the pier is a well known postcard picture. He amusement park is quite recognizable too. Suggest renting a bike which allows you to go to Venice beach and beyond. Plenty of parking nearby.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z5544LOpeterh
50,So much fun,A must stop in California for families with kids. The place is very nice and the kids have a lot of activities.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M4980HVfranciscop
40,It's just ok,Santa Monica Pier has a very nice view of the beach and a big ferris wheel. It is quite small... you could do lunch and take a few pictures and hang out at the beach if you want. I stayed for about 10 mins while I took some pictures but didnt stay for anything else (it was too hot).Would recommend if you are visiting the 3rd street promenade (shopping and eateries) as it is walking distance or if you want to lunch and hang at the beach. But just for sightseeing...not sure if it is worth the ride.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Satraveler318
40,Beautiful at night,We had to ride the Ferris wheel - beautiful view and enjoyed the lights ! Iconic and fun -Staying at Marina del Ray we took Uber over and back. Very glad we did.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foxpalmetto3

40,Cool place,"It’s good. Not as good as every movie and marketing scheme tells you, but it’s good to walk through and take a look. Lots of rides for kids. Few places to eat too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chadphil
40,Nice beachside location close to shopping precinct,"Another iconic tourist destination but really, there is not a lot to do. Some small retail outlets, amusement rides, street buskers and dining at the end of the pier. On a warm sunny day it is always good to be on the beach so this place will always be one that I'll visit on my trip to LA.There is also an excellent shopping precinct a short walk from the Pier so in all, it's a good day out by the sea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Besal68
50,You must go!,The Santa Monica pier was and has been on our list for years. It is as amazing as we thought. It is a picturesque setting and the pics from the pier would have been amazing if not for the sea fog.The sea fog burned off after we left but stillA great place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rooster2439
40,Great tourist attraction!,"Love Santa Monics Pier. More peaceful at night. Filled with tourists, musicians, rides, souvenirs, stores and restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lynnc156
40,Our visit to the pier,"Any and everyone goes to the pier if they are close. We were staying across the street from it, so it was pretty natural to go there. Very nice experience. Lots to see, just be on your toe's.... there's a lot going on around you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinkerchief
40,Fun,"Santa Monica is the quintessential California pier. Crowds, overpriced carnival food, cliche rides but fantastic views, unparalleled ambiance and super fun. Don’t miss it if you’re in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/674dianeq
30,Amusement rides for little ones,"Went at noon on sunny day. Had our 4 year old grandson. We took him on dragon ride 1st and he became scared. Had to stop the ride. After that, he didn't like any of the rides, even the kiddie rides, however, he loved the arcade and the stationery .25 rides outside. He has been on big rides before, so, just not his day.This would probably have been better at night when the rides all lit up.He liked the beach, but out of time by that time.Unique in that you drive and park on the pier. Unusual for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wandabhall
40,Super Touristy But Worth A Visit,The Santa Monica Pier is super touristy but deserves a visit. At sunset you can take amazing photographs from the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itsthetravelguy
50,A Must See & Do in LA !,"This iconic attraction is a must see and do if you are in the area and is obviously very touristy. A vibrant pier with a lovely mix of nostalgia with a nice blend of souvenir shops, eateries and entertainment with glorious views in every direction. Shame about the homeless rifling through the waste bins but this is an epidemic through out LA.However,it is safe and enjoyable and an experience everyone should enrich their lives with.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jadfran1
30,Over-rated but beautiful sunset,"We traveled from Australia and made the trip out to Santa Monica as it was listed as a top destination. We did not like it at all. My sister lives in LA and said it was over-rated and she was right. Apart from the amazing sunset out over the Pacific ocean, I was really underwhelmed with the pier. There were a lot of tourists and I found it cool the cars could park so close to the pier. They did have some cool street artists performing flips and dancing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/56Katrina_M11
40,Amazing View from the Pier!!,"We had a great time at the Santa Monica Pier, There is food you can eat and the big Ferris Wheel ride was amazing. Good place to visit and see the night light in Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/armijow
30,Famous but old...,"I had great expectations from this place, but they were not met. It's not bad bad, but old. I knew this place from television and it looked like that, but still...Anyway, I walked from Venice Beach to Santa Monica Pier and it's nice to have a goal along the walk. There are few restaurants and bars, but the entertainment park doesn't look that great. Maybe it's nice for small kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TomAALTER
40,A must for visitors,Can be a bit crowded but well worth a visit. Just to take stroll on it is nice. Needless to say that the views as magnificent. The mini amusement park is a bonus. Smart to make dinner reservations in advance,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LG4KL
40,touristy amusement,The Santa Monica pier is full of amusement rides and street artists. There is a merry-go-round at the beginning of the pier that is over 100 years old.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllyT43

End of Route 66 sign, Ocean, gift shops, street performers, food as well as a small amusement park.Amusement park offers a few rides and games. There is no fee to walk through.Parking is available nearbyCertainly worth a visit when in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FourStarSplash

30,Crowded,It's ok for family and groups to have fun times - but certainly not for couples or ppl who wants to chill or relax . The place not to my expectation .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/101Ram101
40,Great way to spend a day!,"Heat wave!! Only place to spend it is on the beach! Loads to see and do, plenty of sightseeing and amazing sand and ocean waves",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trevork764
40,Where you can be a grown up kid!,"We visited the pier with friends, dined at Mariasol (Mexican restaurant), played games and rode the giant ferris wheel. Great place to view the beautiful sunset or people watch on the beach. There are also a few gift shops and street acts. Neat place to hang out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larissagreen1
30,Fun if you’re a tourist,"I spent my childhood and teenage years enjoying the pier: the. Endorse, the food, the people watching, the games, the fishermen, the carnival atmosphere. Not a lot has changed, and our foreign visitors enjoyed the stroll, but it’s lost it’s charm for this LA native.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5heartfamily
50,End of Route 66,This place was amazing. It was foggy when we arrived. Then the fog cleared and it was beautiful. Iconic. The food was great and the rides and vendors selling stuff was fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GRMaurer98
40,Beautiful views of Santa Monica,While almost all piers have a tacky side this is a bustling pier full of life from the fishermen and hawkers to the small theme park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeremyS588
50,Atmospheric,"Me and two friends arrived at this destination in the evening and it was buzzing. Lots of people, performances, eateries, shops and amusements. The view out to the sea and back to the land was beautiful. Could easily walk around here for a good 2 hours and it is so close to the muscle beach. Definitely aimed at tourists and had so many there, but created a great friendly environment. Would visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/random4travel
40,Nice sunset,Great place to watch a beautiful California sunset. The pier itself can get quite crowded though. It’s a good place to People watch though. Had a “Cherry Ricky” soda drink at the carousel there - deeelish!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/houstonkiki
40,Lovely views,"The pier is a must see when in Santa Monica, the entertainment is good too and its nice to browse through the gift shops, however the price of $8.50each to ride on the ferris wheel or small rollercoaster is very expensive and the band you can buy is too expensive as there aren’t enough rides to take advantage of it. However that said take a walk along the old fashioned board walk and take a look back at the coast it’s lovely enjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lill252
50,A fun day out,The pier is close to the train line and easily within walking distance.The beach here is lovely also.There are lots of places to eat and drink,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keeping18
50,Beautiful,"This place was incredible! So many dining options, and it was great to read about the history of the pier! Definitely a place to visit while in California!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinakO9566HR
50,A must see!,"My wife and I took our two kids (age 3 & 6) to SMP as part of our week long spring break vacation in the LA area. We really enjoyed the visit! It is a bit of a walk over to the pier but worthwhile. We enjoyed the classic carousel, Ferris wheel and many of the other rides and games. The views at night were gorgeous. This was a highlight of our trip with the kids. Highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoGreenGoWhite1
50,Stunning at night,One of the iconic places to visit if in Santa Monica. The official end of Route 66. You have to see the merry go round. At night it is stunning. Lit up beautifully,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CEM1974

30,"If you're there, by all means head out on the pier.","We went on a Sunday and it was slightly crowded, but there are many things to look at, starting with a 6 or 8 different performers dancing, playing or singing. The ferris wheel is a little pricey at $8.50 per person, but c'mon - you know you want to see the view so do it. We also bought tee shirts in one of the shops, enjoyed a glass of iced tea and watched some dancing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/betona
50,A Lot of Things To Do,"Very cool area with many different things to do. There are nice restaurants, a roller coaster and Ferris wheel, shops and a great boardwalk. Not to mention that there is beautiful beach on either side and a wonderful view of the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrish77

40,A great icon,Definitely worth a visit. Very crowded but a great way to take photos of the beach and grab a drink while watching the sun set into the ocean.There’s a great little amusement park for kids.Just something you have to do while in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisawlg
30,Iconic but a little junky,"The iconic Pier is really showing its age.A nice to do ""once only"" Walk to the end of the pier for a bit of people looking and to say that you have done it but that's about it.I don't know what I was expecting exactly but i wasnt expecting junky tourist rubbish like faded magnets and $10 music cds.The rides are cool to look.But if your staying in close proximity I guess you have to go see it... just once",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matreed
30,Fun but not amazing,Though from a distance the pier looks quite pretty up close it’s a little tacky and while there are a few rides and small carts there’s not a whole lot to do there. There are a few eating options but most consist of fried food - I think I expected something a little different but definitely glad I visited,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StaceyM1443
50,Great times unforgettable,"Took my daughter for the weekend and she loved it! Beautiful pier with tons to do and eat. The best part is the beach is just a few stairs away. Parking is cheap, which is nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PipingHot
40,Showing age but still worth a visit,"The pier as a whole is truly showing its age. With its restaurants, entertainment and shopping it is still worth a visit. The rides as today's standards go are also showing their age, but for the location still have value.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomasmS9076MM
50,Oldie but a goodie,"Spent an evening at the pier after a day at the beach. Saw the Pacific Ocean eat the sun, enjoyed the crashing waves and performers as well. We did play at pacific park as well and truly allowed ourselves to be taken back in time for some nostalgic fun. Keep in mind this is very touristy and that also brings with it its share of homeless as well. Never felt unsafe at all, but certainly something to be aware of.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G9778DIjimh
30,Worth a 30 min visit in the day time...,Nothing to see hear folks....Like I said above...Worth a 30 min visit in the day time...Better food choices can be food else where on land.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chris_Mesa
50,Must-see,This is one of my favorite spots when in the area. You could spend a whole day here! Love the food stands and riding the Pacific Wheel. Always looking forward to visiting this place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindsaywk
50,Must See,"Santa Monica Pier brings to mind the old school beach board. Being from the East Coast, I was excited to see how the West Coast handles their beach boardwalks--Santa Monica Pier wasn't a disappoint. Whether you are talking a tour or the beach is your final destination, Santa Monica Pier, the beach, and the boardwalk is a worthwhile experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leaving_Samsara
50,Walks,What a wonderful day leisurely stroll friendly people and plenty of fun for everyone recommended for all,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/645francesw
50,Amazing viewpoint,Great pier to lookout to coast and check out the beachAdvice to watch the sunsetAmusement park has plenty of rides and fun,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Livevitae
20,Interesting peir bad crowd and bad service,"The peir and ocean looked beautiful. The arcade was fun. However, the smell of people smoking illegal substances. It was very difficult to steer two young children into an area without the smell or a unkept individual. The resturants were packed and service was slow. At Bubba Gumps the waiter forgot to bring tomato sauce for our kid's pasta and meatballs. We asked three different wait staff over 20 minutes to bring some pasta sauce for a meal it should have been standard on the kid's menu. Funny thing is the kid's meal was ordered first. Very disappointed with the crowd and service. We wanted to go into the water, but the water was brown at the shore, which was weird since the water was blue at the end of the peir. I would not reco.mend this place for families with young children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/army2xvet
40,Santa Monica Pier,"A nice place to visit. The Big wheel and a few rides, but many places to buy holiday t shirts and hats for friends and family. Nice places to eat, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MilanS509
50,Just like the movies,This is so beautiful! Just like in the movies!! It is a great place to wonder around and the restaurant on the end of the pier was lovely,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ahay94
40,A bit dated but you can say that you have been here.,We came to this place because it was the end of the Route 66 trip and the end of route 66 is on the Pier. As a spectacle it is worth a look but be prepared to pay for the experience. T shirts on the Pier over $30 and food very high priced. The merry go round was good value though and it was a step back in time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudyandBillG
40,End of Route 66,Santa Monica had a very layed back vibe which is a welcome break from the concrete jungle of L.A. We spent most of the day there and took a hop on hop off tour to Venice as well. A must see for all visitors. Best of all it is the end of Route 66. How cool is that!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neels80
50,Happy fun place!,"Plenty of parkingRides are safe for the kidsFriendly and caring staffBeach, amusement park, souvenirs & Bubba Gump",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wengM18
30,Average way to spend an hour,"Nothing great about the pier. You overlook the ocean and have overpriced gift shops. It's nice to say you did it, but unless your eating there it won't take long. There are homeless and beggars so be ready for that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/637jaimew
40,A tourist paradise,"The most visited space in Santa Monica! Interesting people, nice restaurants and activities for all, at a cost!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/torquemg2112
40,Small but fun,A nice pier with great views of the beach. Myself and a friend went in later September when the beach was quiet I would feel if it was during the weekend or on a school holiday it would be too busy to enjoy your time. There are street entertainers some were good singers or dancers others felt embarrassing or not as good. I would go again but probably wouldn't stay longer then 2 hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L9443VHjasonl
30,A bit interesting,A typical pier with tourist trinkets for sale and buskers.Rated as average at best as the water and sand around the pier looked very polluted. The pier itself was noisy with all the buskers.On the upside our lunch at Bubba Gump's which was nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebraK511
40,Lit-up Carnival Pier,"An old fashioned boardwalk pier with great neon at night. See the roller coaster and ferris wheel at night. Enjoy the foods and don't miss the ""penny arcade"" for vintage games and skee-ball. Also don't wish to be BIG when you speak to Zolar for the Movie ""BIG""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drmojo48
30,Checked the box,"My family has always wanted to visit Santa Monica pier. We had the opportunity to do so last week, and my kids enjoyed the carnival rides. The area was rather dirty and had a foul smell. There were many random vendors dancing or singing for money. The beach was filthy with trash.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MKMPTravelers
10,A must see,"Loved the Pier, lots to see and plenty of cafes. I waited about 4 minutes at an ice cream counter,and the man gave me a free ice cream because I’d waited so long! How’s that for service?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/546JulieC546
40,Fyn,Great fun on here with lovely views of the beach and sunset. Several souvenir shops and photo opportunities. A must visit. Muscle beach next door and it’s the end of Route 66.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UK123123
30,It is what it is...,"This is the kind of place that kids would love, being able to see past the tarnish, touches of grime, and multiple cart vendors selling the same instant artwork based on your name or putting your name on a grain of rice. As an adult, it was a nice enough walk out to the end of the pier and back, but nothing had much holding power beyond that. The ride area felt cleaner, and would be a fun place to take kids for a bit. At night, it's quite lit up. The ferris wheel offers fairly interesting light shows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/merryleg
40,Great place to people watch,"Nice walk, end of route 66, tourist trap but that makes for the best people watching. Grabbed some food (nachos and salsa is a good bargain) some good views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CoasterNerdett
40,Pier Visit,"Watch the sunset. A place to pick up a rapidly drawn portrait of yourself or a couple. Avoided as an adult the expensive rides, junk food and tacky souvenirs. So a free area to enjoy nature.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewjpatten
30,"the story of popeye originated here, also end of route 66!","the history of the pier is an interesting read, the amenities could be cleaner as the are always being used but not much care in cleanliness.the rides on the pier are average but we had a good time here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matandsabs
50,Idyllic,It so lived to my expectations and more. Regret not staying another couple of days. A must place to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sunnymismai
40,Fun time at night,"The pier is just one of those destinations that you must see while in Santa Monica: neon sign at night, Forest Gump reference with the pier, the arcades, pier performers, roller coaster and tons of ""carnival"" food. We visited both day and night and we preferred the night. You can get the real feel of the pier at day (not really a great site but nice to see the ocean in the background). The rides were fun. Hardly a good selection of food until you leave the pier. But you can always visit the restaurants right across the street. Bring napkins to the restrooms. They ran out both times we were there. Overall it was a fun experience for a visitor to Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CultureLush
50,great atmosphere,"fun atmosphere, and very nice especially in the evening with all the lights on, mingling with the crowd, enjoying the attractions. Some great restaurants in the area, parking can be tough, go to the public ones",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DannyD2777
20,disappointed,"I had seen pictures of the Santa Monica Pier which were taken at a distance, and so this place was on my list of things to do in Los Angele. I have to say it looks better in photos than close up. It's basically a tourist trap with cheap trinkets and a few carnival rides. Would recommend the Manhattan Beach pier instead for those looking for an ocean view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cecesimms
40,Great time at the pier,The pier offers great eating choices and and a fun side with the rides and entertainment. It gets quite busy on the weekends and easy to walk around during the week.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/230mandyk
50,A Great Feel for Tradition,"What a nice feel of England on the west coast of the US.A wooden pier with a mix of funfair rides, food concessions selling “sugar” and assorted tat for sale - excellent.Superb sunset views from the end - catered for by two excellent viewing platforms. Has to be done.It is iconic and deserves the place in the hearts of all those who live in or love Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YorkTraveller1962
30,Underwhelming,This is one of those places to visit simply to have the experience. It's outdated and dirty. The water looks brownish-yellowish; I've never seen ocean water look like this. There are many people fishing off the pier which I thought was disgusting considering what the water looked like. This also made the restaurant located at the pier undesirable.The vendors had typical tourist merchandise and the only fruit vendors we stopped at to get a snack were ridiculously overpriced.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shernandez710
30,Nice to see,"Nice to stop here and see this place in person, but one time is enough. There are so many homeless around and we even saw 2 men doing drugs. It was nice to walk to the end of the pier and then leave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U8335EFlisar
50,Beautiful view,"For walking and hang out,pet friendly, aquarium close by but when I was there it was closed.Very close to downtown and shopping mall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/435isabelb
40,Really nice pier,"Nice feel about Santa Monica pier. Saw the sunset the day before from Venice beach but can imagine its just as good if not better from here. Still, cant really go wrong - was a gorgeous sunny day, not a cloud in the sky and nice sea breeze. Lots of little shops and a couple places to eat on the pier as well as a couple of rides.Nothing extraordinary but it was nice, not overdone and not tacky. The beach looked really nice as well, and you can get some great pictures of the beach and shoreline from the pier. We paid $2 to park right by the pier as well so you can't really go wrong.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/olihenryy
30,A bit tacky,"We love parking and walking along the beach at Santa Monica and the Pier always looks great as you walk towards it. When you get there it is always a little bit disappointing although there are good bits (views, end of Route 66, Big Dipper) to counter the bad (crowds, cheap tacky stalls, overpriced food).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A5830SBjohnd
50,Start of Route 66,I always enjoy the experience of Santa Monica Pier. Always eat at Buba Gumps--good service and good food. I enjoy ataching people and did alot of that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobgilly
40,Stopped before heading home,Stopped before catching our plane home. It was great! Live music and colorful people. Everyone was super nice. Lost of homeless around was the only downfall.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Medusadamage
10,Avoid it,"Look, unless I’m really bored, I avoid “piers” like the plague. I’m not into the carnival atmosphere. Cheap junk everywhere. At least some of the street performers were OK. Do yourself a favor and go 5 blocks to the east and find real stores and things to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xamers
50,So much fun!,"It was beautiful! We walked the boardwalk and beach, had a refreshing margarita and listened to music. It was the perfect day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/magiselr
50,Wonderful place to relax in the sun,"I was fortunate to be able to make it out to Santa Monica on a recent trip to the US. The metro from LA is the best option for public transport and while it can be a little long, it is well worth the trip.A stroll along the pier is an absolute must and I would recommend getting there early in the morning so as to avoid the crowds.The pier itself feels so grand and old with the end of the pier offering great views of people just fishing and watching the boats sail past.You would be crazy to not go to Santa Monica Pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Drbinoche
50,Good views,Pretty good. Something for everyone there. Amazing views of the cost. You can fish from the end of the pier. There's street entertainment on the pier but they kind of expect you to give them alittle something if you stand long enough to watch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/546alician
50,The best View,Awesome ... to experience the pleasant breeze of the ocean and spectacular view of the Ferris wheel made this stop last of Route 66 one of our favourites .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nifty1956
50,Great beach and attractions,Loved the beach area here and the pier. It was a holiday weekend so it was super crowded. I will go back again when it’s not so busy. There are some nice rides for the kids and a lot of kiosks to buy souvenirs. Several great places to eat as well. The traffic and parking is really bad though so time yourself accordingly. There is only one road in and out of this area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kris_goku
50,Saturday evening on Santa Monica Pier,"The end of Route 66 and a popular destination for families at weekend and tourists alike. This is a must visit just like the Hollywood sign. It’s popular with locals for fishing. Plenty of parking locally. The are numerous restaurants on the pier and around the area.The Pier has lots of shopping, street performers and the amusement park with plenty of rides for adults and children. Don’t miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/motorcar1
50,Great place to be at sunset!,This is such a nice place to be on a warm summer evening. Gets crowded but has a nice feel and lots of entertaining things to see and do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/effiec2013
50,Cali must see,"A trip to Santa Monica pier is a LA must do day trip .Either a walk or bike rental to Venice beach , a Ferris wheel ride and some old school carnival games .Also a sunset margarita at Mariasol ( skip the food ) is a perfect way to end the day .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christopherc804
40,Grest Place,"We enjoyed a nice stroll at the pier, great views and pleasant atmosphere, lots of musicians and artists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ardgie
50,A must if you are in LA,"I really love Santa Monica, for me it was the best of LA, really nice beach, the walking street was a nice place to go shopping and dining. We were with 2 kids under 4 and they had a blast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daninoguera31
40,The iconic Santa Monica pier.,Plenty to do at Santa Monica pier.We did visit the gaming arcade but found it sad to see the poor condition some of the games were in. It was still enjoyable way to spend some time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beaglesx2
30,Nostalgic charm?,"The pier is obviously some kind of an icon spot for the locals and I appreciate there might be a bit of nostalgia around it. Seen with 'fresh' pair of eyes, the place is rather rowdy, crowden and dotted with 'souvernirs' sellers - it was hard to buy something non tacky even if you wanted to. What I liked however, is the great viewpoint over Santa Monica beach towards Venice Beach and Malibu. It is pleasant to look down at the surfers and beach goers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OlgaM924
40,Cap Off Your Day. Go at Sunset.,"We love to stop by here at least once on our trips to L.A.. We went at sunset, so we could enjoy a nice view and walk to the end of the pier, as well as catch some dinner. We had a nice surprise at the end of the pier, as there was a seal who was going back and forth for photo opportunities. Obviously this seal is being fed along there to keep hanging out. All the same, it was a unexpected.The parking can get crazy, but it is fair priced at $12.00. If you are coming in the main gate, they want you to pay cash at the booth. If you do not have cash, they have a machine for you to get out and pay at next to the booth for you to make the payment instead. They offer 3 different types of parking. Some is up on the pier, one down on the beach, and another across the bridge. All within walking distance and not too far away from the pier.The pier has always been crowded anytime we have ever come here no matter the time of year or whether chilly or not. There is an amusement part on the pier, and it seems to stay busy with the rides packed as usual. If in the area at sunset, it's worth the walk to catch those views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/runaway2travel
40,Busy yet fun (expensive),"No doubt it is a a tourist trap, but still a legendary place to go. I bought a surfboard for my daughter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickvegas
30,Expensive,Family of 6 2 kids aged 9 and 10 travelled to the pier. The water looked dirty. The food options on the pier were limited and expensive.If you intend on riding any of the rides its on the more expensive side.The kids loved the arcade!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/144kated
50,Must see Attraction,"We visited his attraction numerous times on our recent trip to Santa Monica from Australia.This is an iconic attraction that most people associate with Santa Monica. The Pier has numerous attractions ranging from restaurants, souvenir/tourist-type stores, and other quirky shops. At the very end of the pier is a theme park. Good fun for the family. Also check our Pier Burgers and the Bubba Gump Shrimp Factory. The Pier can be very busy, but it certainly wasn't overwhelming. We felt very safe here during both the day and night. There are a lot of entertainment on the Pier with busking/street performers. Lots of live music. The Pier also provides great photo opportunities as you look back on the Santa Monica coast line. The Ferris Wheel is another great photo opportunity of the coast.This place gave us a real feel for Santa Monica and the people/culture of the area.I highly recommend this if visiting Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlenFC
50,Go at sunset,Visit the pier around 5:30pm and wonder around to take in the atmosphere and watch the sun set into the water,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarinaB_Sydney
50,Beautiful pier,"Loved my experience of Santa Monica pier. Beautiful day, great view of the beach and ocean. Was lucky enough to see some dolphins. Rode the big wheel (Ferris wheel) you have places to stop in for food, drinks and snacks. Nice little shops/ stalls to buy pretty souvenirs. Definitely would love to go back when I visit next time. Lovely beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bettscockburn
30,Disappointed,"Didn’t think much of the pier. Looked tired, run down. Rubbish food and a couple of stores. Some carnival rides. The beach was nice. Santa Monica itself was pretty but the pier didn’t overly impress me",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mytravel-7202
50,Lovely to visit,"Santa Monica pier is so easy to get to with metro direct from downtown L.A. aswell as great bus links.It has a basic fairground with a ferris wheel, bumper cars etc. It is safe and family friendly.People see their ware on stalls but are never in your face or pushy about purchasing items.The end of route 66 is signposted at Santa Monica pier so that's pretty cool to see.The pier it's self has restaurants and quick eats with plenty parking either on the pier or very close by.The beach goes on for miles at either side of the pier which makes the area very open, fresh and scenic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ethelc8405
30,Beautiful View,The view from all around the pier was beautiful. I walked the entire pier to see all sides during the day time before the rides and most attractions opened. It looked like maybe they are replacing wood and doing repairs to the pier because of stacks wood and workers present. I would say the pier does need work and that’s why it didn’t get 5 stars. Most of the buildings need updating but there is a sense of nostalgia for the 80’s. The arcade even has the Zoltor machine which was pretty cool.Bird poop everywhere. Dirty fish skinning boards. Pier just needs TLC.Parking was $12 all day. Go before 10am and you should be fine. Shops along the street leading to the pier were too notch as well as the food. Many sea food places to choose from.Multiple music vendors make the pier noisy with their instruments clashing with each other looking for tips. Homeless scattered on the beach below.Overall it’s what I expected from a historic place and the views were wonderful. Just needs work.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nalbrecht12
40,Worth the Walk to the End of the Pier,I'm a sucker for a walk along any pier so to walk the boards of Santa Monica Pier was a must do activity during my trip. I walked onto the pier at 15:00 with the weather sunny and clear which is a bonus having walked many piers in fog and rain. This pier is a famous landmark and it didn't disappoint. With its Ferris wheel and indoor funfair ride it was a delight to view as I walked to the end. The view back towards Santa Monica was also great together with the view along the Venice Beach shoreline (a planned walk).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaely416
10,Not our cup of tea.,"Not being a lover of piers in the UK, this did nothing for us. It was packed but why, only those enjoying it could say. It basically mirrors piers we have here so has the usual 'trashy’ shops and fast food outlets albeit with much better weather than we get back home.We aim to visit Santa Monica again but this will not be on the to do list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/10chris02
40,Fun Pier,My first time ever to visit this pier! After we had dinner at “Meat” we walked the pier. Nice assortment of pier vendors and as well individual pier performers. They have a pretty big Ferris wheel too. Lots of food vendors to choose from. The pier looks like a popular spot for fisherman too. Well worth your time to walk it!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel_and_Eat_Too
50,The Best Place To Be,So much fun. Didn't want to leave. I hope to return one day. I felt so happy there and really did not want the day to end.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barendinas
50,So much better than Malibu Pier,Great choice of food and quaint traditional fairground which was complemented by a variety of street musicians performing on the pier. Don't miss the opportunity to get a photo at the end of Route 66 or the original muscle beach just to the right as you leave the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rustygrecian
20,Big Disappointment,"We arrived at out hotel and decided to visit the pier that evening. It was about 7:30 pm when we arrived and found the amusement park shutting down leaving only a couple of chain restaurants, a bunch of souvenir vendors and snack carts, and a large number of ""acts"" trying to attract your donations. It was not worth our effort to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/909danns
50,Nostalgic Stroll!,"A stroll on the Santa Monica Pier is a stroll into nostalgia....From a distance, I see its iconic 108-year-old arch entrance arch sign just as when I first glimpsed it over 40 years ago while carrying fishing gear.Near entrance, beefy male attired in tight brief performed with boa constrictor seeking donations while other street performers jump over 6 hunched over recruited volunteers.As I step on Pier's wooden planks, I see the historic hippodrome with the original 1922 Carousel of hand-carved horses. To my left I see the video arcade where $5.00 in quarters enabled us to play for long time on Street Fighter.Further on my left, I see Pacific Park with its yellow roller coaster and iconic US's only solar-powered Ferris wheel where once I shared a chair with my dear friend Robyn and mentee Charlie.To my right, I peer down on the swimmers and sunbathers enjoying themselves on world famous beach. Kids are running up and down wet sand as waves splash in and recede.Further down Pier, I pass vendors peddling caps, purses, drinks, snacks and Route 66 souvenirs. Artist is sketching kid while onlookers admire work. Musician is singing for donations. Magician is bending and unbending fork with mind power.Everywhere are visitors and tourists enjoying the sun and warm Pacific Ocean breeze -- great place for families...At end of west end, I check for fishing conditions at tackle shop, The Last Stop of historic Route 66 that connected 2448 miles away with Chicago. (Fishing is slow with some mackerel being hooked -- water still too cold...)It was here over 40 years ago when sun was just rising on my first visit that I bumped into my fishing friend from Northern California who also was fishing the Pier for first time! We had lost contact for 7 years, yet here we accidentally meet.Pier has warm place in my heart -- many good memories....Unfortunately, we got skunked. But it was still fun to flip line and hook at special fishing landing at far west end which is built lower than Pier for fishing",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joey88888
50,Great Views of The Sunset,This is pretty cool place to catch the great Pacific Ocean sunsets and views of the mountains that line the coast as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/QDOGG8
40,Nice place for a visit,"Although there were realy many people, it was a nice visit there. some street art, some merchants, many many people.if u come here by car, u need a ticket for parking, which is about 12 $. otherwise u wont find a place to park ur car .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m-a-whv
40,Old time pier but not old time prices,We stopped here during one of our stops on a tour. It was a blast from the past reminding me of when I was a child from yesteryear. A beautiful Merry go round indoors and a big Ferris Wheel were 2 of the stand out rides for me. Tons of food vendors lined the pier so you definitely won't go hungry. Just bring your pocketbook because everything was extremely expensive. 1 cone=$9.I was amazed to see the amount of homeless people sleeping right outside the entrance to the pier. This is not handicap easy since the wooden slates on the boardwalk would be difficult to push a wheelchair on plus there is a steep hill leading down to the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenr873
30,Fun in the sun!,"It was fun watching playing air hockey and the old-fashioned arcade games. Also, the rides are pretty aged, but what it lacks in updated rides it gains in nostalgia. The ferris wheel is the best way to get the best view of the pier, Santa Monica & the Pacific Ocean all at once. We used our Go LA Cards, so the rides were free & unlimited. It would not have been worth it to purchase ride-by-ride (in my opinion).TIP #1: No smoking on the pier!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pmhuett
40,beachy,it's a boardwalk. great for kids and if you're a local..it's a nice walk in the mornings and evenings. easily accessible to the beach as well. lots of things to see/do on the pier. my favorite restaurant is the Albright on it. Weekends are jammed packed. Don't let the mass crowd fool your from afar. Once you're down there...pleasantly it doesn't seem that crowded. I know..odd.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/25huyd
40,Really pretty at night,"I took my nieces here and they loved it, they wanted to ride the roller-coaster and the ferris wheel, which were both fun. A single ride ticket costs $8.50. There were a lot of people there even on a Sunday night. One of the little gift shops there was cute and had so many different souvenir options. The Beach burger place was a nice little joint to eat from. The meals were a little overpriced but the service was quick. All together, the visit was really nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/98maghanb
50,Favorite Santa Monica attraction,"The pier is an old and beloved Santa Monica attraction. People of all ages are sure to have a great time. There’s a museum, kid rides and food places. Plus the view of the ocean is unbeatable. Tourists flood it in summer so try to stick to going on a weekday, but off-season you’re sure to have a great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saraheleid
40,Worth a trip,It nice to be a part of Southern California history. Worth a trip when visiting the greater LA area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UNION_THUG_ALWAYS
50,Must visit,"You are in Santa Monica, you can't some skip the Pier, it is a must visit place, so lively...so full of people, just so amazing when the weather is sunny and nice, it is surely worth your whole day visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Malnaser
20,Rundown and too busy,"Santa Monica beach is great, but you can skip the pier unless you are specifically going for an amusement ride. The pier is overcrowded and the surface is not level in parts which makes it hard for some walkers. Also, if you are hungry there are better food options across the street looking directly at the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fionao315
50,Californiaaaaaa,"Well California is one of my favourite places to visit in the US. There is so much to and see, and plenty of beaches to visit. This trip we chose Santa Monica pier and Oceanside beach in San Diego. Santa Monica is the one beach people think to see as it's in movies and tv shows, the Ferris wheel is the most recognized part of the beach! I wanted the kids to see it as teenagers as they had forgotten being there as little kids. They enjoyed walking around and spending the day, but found it to be a little crowded. We have been to many other beaches in California on previous trips so, we spent another day getting surfing lessons on Oceanside beach as we rented a condo nearby. The area is really nice ,less busy than most places as it's not very touristy,more locals than anything. There were plenty of restaurants to choose from and our first time visiting Joe's Crab Shack ! This was probably my most favourite family trip ever and I look back on the pictures often and regularly. The kids enjoys the excitement of Hollywood Blvd and seeing the sign is a highlight !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TerriB948
40,"Great fun, sunny atmosphere.","This was our second visit to Santa Monica, we really enjoy the pier. Everybody is here to have fun, there are some funny entertainers trying to earn a living and plenty of places to eat and drink. The beaches either side are fantastic for some relaxation and there are excellent paths to either walk, cycle (bikes available to hire), skate etc. along to Venice and further. I have only ever visited during the day time, but I imagine that it would be great in the night too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulBox
50,We love it,"So much fun for adults me and my husband rent bikes and ride from Venice till the pier and it’s amazing, be sure to ride the Ferris wheel at sunset time for a beautiful breath taking view. We highly recommend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/107pamellac
50,Busy as always,"Santa Monica Pier is always fun in the evenings. The lights and all the people make for lovely ""sightseeing"".Be careful tho, pickpockets are also always around !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zienesch
40,Old American Charm,"It is as I expected, a throwback to the carnival piers. Great experience with fantastic beaches either side.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrianCorbally
40,Santa Monica Institution,"A stroll along Santa Monica Pier is an amazing way to soak up the atmosphere of the area. Its always packed with people from all walks of life and offers a mixed bag of trinket shopping, busking entertainment, carnival rides and a great Mexican restaurant at the piers end. Its easy for a few hours to pass by on a stroll up and back. If you're an avid ""tourist photo"" taker there's the opportunity to snap away under the sign that signifies the end of Route 66.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlibucket
40,Experience and entertaining!,"It's an experience, an eye opener the characters are hilarious, it is expensive, but it's entertaining! People are crazy, you will see and hear so many differences here, the food is crazy because there is jut so much sugar and saturated fats but you cannot deny it is fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarieandJules
40,California adventure,"Lovely pier. Looked even better in real life than it did on the tv. Eating icecream looking out at the Pacific ocean. One thing i didnt like was the homeless situation. Its uncomfortable for them to be around so much. Whilst i didnt get approached by any of them, it still makes me very nervous. There was police cars on there but still a nervous feelingPlenty of shops on the pier. Good fairground. Except the couple of homeless on there had an excellent time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolynprichard
40,Returned again,The pier is a place to visit in santa monica. Great for people watching a couple of nice re restaurants. Souvenir shops galore and nice views of the ocean. Only drawback this visit was the amusement park was closed for a special event. Shasta ok though as I found out it was for the special Olympics. Great cause!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/721jeffo
40,Lovely night time visit,"Popped onto the pier in the evening, just after the sun had gone down, driving from LA up the West Coast. Lovely atmosphere, music and performers dotted along the pier. I imagine it's a lot busier during the day but it was a lovely atmosphere when I was there and nice seeing it all lit up against the night sky.Had my go at a twist on the classic end of Route 66 tourist pic.Classic pier experience and some good fresh air after being stuck in the car driving!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eloisem390
10,Sad and not what we had expected,"We are spending the weekend in Los Angeles before joining a cruise tomorrow. We have the whole day free today so decided to head to the beach and had heard great things about Santa Monica and Venice beach. We were awake early after flying in from London yesterday so caught a taxi from our beautiful hotel (Beverly Wilshire) to Santa Monica pier (USD 40 for an LA Taxi). There are so many homeless people it is very sad. So many people living/sleeping on the beach, not just a couple here and there but the whole way from Santa Monica pier to Venice beach. The walk is fantastic and great to see so many people exercising and having group gym lessons along the way but you just can't get away from the poor homeless people. Great to see a couple of food kitchens along the front, both of which had long queues....but again very unexpected. The plan was to sit at an ocean front cafe, have breakfast and enjoy the view but we couldn't face it so decided to return to downtown LA this time using an Uber (USD 15). The beach was great and so wide but honestly these 2 iconic places just weren't what we had hoped for. Santa Monica pier was dirty with a number of homeless men rooting through the bins searching for food. It made me think of how much help and support we have for the homeless back in the UK. I can't recommend sorry!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/948annettea
40,Must see,Nostalgia all around. And the refreshing scent of the pacific. Beautiful views. Must see when driving the PCH.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJWVD
50,Fun Carnival feel,The Santa Monica Pier is fun if you want to have a beachy carnival feel. We went on a Friday evening and they were playing a big screen movie. The carnival games are expensive but it's part of the carnival/fair experience. It's worth a stop when visiting Santa Monica.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelkat2570
40,Sunny Santa Monica,"Being that our last day in L.A. was spent around here this was a great choice for our last activity.Though it was quite busy our luck got us a close carpark and possibly the last 2 seats at the famous BubbaGumps restaurant.From the beautiful merry-go-round to the roller-coaster and all that's in between, you will enjoy this seaside spot.Don't forget the prawns and margaritas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heppyc

30,Chaos,"Went for a trip here from Hollywood during our stay on a warm Saturday afternoon. The place was rammed, traffic & people everywhere getting in each other's way.I was hoping for a relaxing afternoon with a few drinks and a meal at the beach, but in reality it's just junk food, souvenirs & buskersbetter options I think",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottn769

It was relaxing and extremely fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dagoboi
40,Meh It's your basic tourist trap beach pier,"Nothing super special except for the awesome view of beautiful water and the mountains. Its your usual tourist trap with high priced rides and over priced not very good food BUT it is one of those been there done that's, that you just have to do while in Santa Monica",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missskyangel
40,Try by Day and photograph by nigh,"The Pier at Santa Monica has enough to keep a family interested for hours with rides stalls, and amusement arcade. The coaster is tame and good for the whole family. Great views along the beach and ocean from the ferris wheel. Enough eateries including Bubba Shrimp. The best time to visit is just in time to catch the fabulous sunset over the ocean and gran some great pictures of the Pier attractions illuminations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M7125OYcarlb
50,Better than I remember it,"We reached this place and we parked the car right on the pier where there were lots of parking spaces on a hot Monday September afternoon.Despite all this the place was packed with tourists and the restaurants were making a roaring trade. The street 'gymnasts' were also attracting lots of tourists and the little shops were also busy with people.Even with all this, you can simply relax in the quieter areas if you do not want to live in the fast lane and simply enjoy in the sights and take on the atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TERRAvelista

40,Fun but crowded and expensive,The rides on the pier are expensive unless you get a wrist band and stay for awhile. There are vendors all over and lots of atmosphere. The only drawback is that any food items are expensive and the place was super crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CER

40,Fun little visit,"We stopped here for a quick 2 hour visit to walk around, eat, and have ice cream. A little crowded and very sunny with little shade, so make sure you put on some sun screen! Also finding parking was difficult, be prepared to walk a little ways from your car to the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kelsey2993
50,Great night out to enjoy the breezy!,Love the view of ocean and be on the ferris wheel. Made my experience a positive one to enjoy the LA in the evening. Sunset view is amazing from the pier.

Very busy. Great beach for kids and looked a good swimming beach. We didn't spend a long time there as went to Venice beach. Could have missed Venice beach out and stayed here longer. Rides were $7-8 per ride. We did the small roller coaster. Not immense ride but more iconic than anything. Great atmosphere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Angelalala49
40,Worth a look just because it is the Santa Monica Pier,"Nice to have a stroll out to the end of the pier and have a look back around the coast. There are food shops out near the end and other stalls that sell the typical touristy souvenirs. It’s worth a walk just because of what it is and because of the history. Have a look at the information boards at the end, near the restrooms.If you wander out around midday you can have lunch and maybe spend 2 hours in total including the walk out and back.Most shops / stalls don’t open til about 10-00 am.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrisBarry
50,Santa Monica pier,A great place to visit any time of the year but especially in the summer months. Some old time favorites still exist like the carousel and the amusement arcade.

A must if you find yourself in Santa Monica.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chesterdraws1
30,A pleasant place.,A good place to spend an afternoon with kids.The kids got board waiting for rides.But enjoid the location on the sea.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/371chenr
20,"Great if you like crowds, addicts, homeless and body odor....","Brought my son to see the pier and the Pacific Ocean on a recent trip to LA. I was told that the Santa Monica Pier was a great place to go. I couldn't have been more disappointed.We walked down Colorado and across Ocean Avenue to head down onto the pier. In doing so we passed several men between 18-55 who were tweaking. We passed another 4-6 people who were passed out on the curb or in the chairs for customers to use outside of restaurants.Once we crossed onto the pier things improved, though it was very crowded with a ton of people heading over onto the pier and to the beach. My son really enjoys arcades so I was hopeful that Playland would be a good time. Unfortunately, it was one of the worst arcades that I've been too in a long time. The place was packed with games, more than should have been in that confined space. But they were mostly run-down and over priced. They have a bunch of air hockey tables but they are all stacked in like sardines. That makes slipping the $1.00 in quarters a bit tough if the table next to you is in use.Bubba Gump's looked good, but we weren't in the mood for food at that time. Otherwise, the rest of the pier is forgettable in my opinion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rubicon_Johnny
40,View from Ferris Wheel is great!,"This is a good old fashion fair. Rides are somewhat small but still fun, just like the old time fairs. Lots of good food everywhere like fennel cakes. Lots of games too. Many small shops as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeaseLAXer
40,Walk the pier,Well worth a visit this pier is about 1/2mile long and is bustling. Would recommend eating and/or drinking at Jims which is situated at the start of the pier. A variety of musicians and singers located between the various stalls perform on the pier and create a pleasant atmosphere. For those interested in history the pier marks the end of historic Route 66.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/linh793
30,Ok,"The pier is ok, but there are better places to visit. You can walk the pier and see everything in about 30 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H8975PPjohnw
40,Nice place for a walk,Was there at 11 am when it's not so busy. It's a nice place but if you want to try the amusement park it doesn't open until noon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/773nicholasn
50,"Great wooden pier, with easy parking - iconic!!","Loved this pier - being able to drive onto the actual wooden pier, park easily, for a very reasonable fee and see the beautiful beach and the Pacific stretch away from you - what's not to love!!A little tacky - obviously, but well worth a visit - just wish we could have been these in the evening to watch the sunset!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusannaW799
30,Santa Monica Trip,It has been 20 years since my last visit to the pier and it shows. I found it to be very run down and literally a waste of time to have stopped there. I guess if you have never been you might want to see it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnnyvegas22
10,Am I blind,"I can only assume I missed the wonderful vibrant delightful place this is in all the reviews and have gone blind. I can only hope this place is different at night as I visited during the day but I'm not holding out any hope at all.Parking was east and close by the beach weather was hot sun was out so a great start sadly that's where it ended.Walked up onto the pier to be met by about 6 police offers and a guy covered in his own poo now I didn't see what happen could have been anything just not a nice thing to see.The pier it self is very worn and run down glad I didn't pre book the park tickets as it would have been a waste of money took one walk round (1 minute walk at most) and decided against going on any the rides.Toilets - unless u can hover don't bother absolutely disgusting and full of drug users and homeless and people looking in bins tho they do provide seat covers if you have to go.Now as a fitness fan I was looking forward to walking to muscle beach and taking in the sights - nope didn't happen eitherWalked with the misses for about 5 minutes the smell off drugs in the air police moving people on some weird woman shouting at random people , homeless people everywhere decide to sack the idea and spent the day in Beverly Hills/Hollywood areaComplete waste off the morning",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/w33abo
30,Not much going on but worth seeing,"Unless you're going for Pacific Park, churros, funnel cakes or hotdogs it's probably not really worth going to the Pier. There are a handful of restaurants and interesting stalls but nothing spectacular. Oh and there's a lot of people that like to fish here... it looks better from a distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bexxcx
50,What a great outing!,Enjoyed the pier and all there is to do. Loved riding the Ferris wheel and the lovely view it affords the riders! Beach is so pretty. Went in the late afternoon / early evening and it was just a perfect family outing!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GBWeible
50,You just have to visit at night,"Jetlagged and trying to stay awake, headed for the iconic bright lights of the pier on our first night. Ate at the Mexican restaurant right at the end, shared a main as it was plenty and you get a big bowl of nachos to start you off for free. Dined watching the Ferris wheel illuminate our first holiday memory. Loved it. Tip: Parking is difficult but if you're prepared to pay $20 for convenience then park over the road from the pier entrance at one of the hotels. For a tired traveller it was worth it! Enjoy!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roadtripper64
40,"""Everything"" ends here","Very busy tourist spot on the shore, it's one of the things you'll have to visit. Get an ice cafe and walk a long the beach and pop into one of the many restaurants. Be aware that you'll properly be a little disappointed because it's not as polished as you see in he movies.Restaurants are a little overpriced, but it's all about location location location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielbB4742IW
40,Great day overall?,When I was looking into beaches to visit.. this one was closer geographically to where we were and it didn't make sense to travel to Malibu (35+ miles away) and Laguna (60+ miles away)... Parking was $12 bucks we went on a weekday it was actually empty... we layed on the beach and then walked up the pier for tacos at the very end of the pier.... bought some souvenirs overall great time there! I will be back!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gpeshee
40,Beautiful Beach and Boardwalk,I recently visited the boardwalk and beach and I was really impressed. Beach was excellent and the boardwalk was really iconic. It really was a real American experience and if I am in the area again I will be back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JOC834

50,Fun visit,"We visited Santa Monica pier twice during our visit. The first time during the day, the second in the evening.Both visits were different and had a different feel to them. The evening was fun with music and the pier lit up. We had dinner and then wandered down the pier to people watch. During the day, it was quieter but we enjoyed being able to see everything with less crowds. We were lucky enough to see 2 local seals off the end of the pier begging for fish from the local fishermen! If in LA, take the time to spend either an evening or an afternoon here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Katabout

30,It's nice to look at the ocean from above,"Being from NYC, it was as if I was in Coney Island..one pass though and I was good to leave. There isn't much to see. Very short pier with many vendors and lots of crazy homeless people around.The only really nice thing about the pier was overlooking the ocean and beach from above.If it's you first time in Santa Monica, it seems like a must do...but I wouldnt get hyped about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marleneqm
30,Afternoon stroll,I know this is one of California's iconic piers but they need to think about a few sympathetic upgrades in places as do parts are a bit tired and dated. Otherwise great atmosphere and fantastic place for the amateur photographers to get those shots.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IzzysDad
50,Good,"Third time here and still worth a visit ,Love going here for the food and views and the rides.Loved it here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zitziubummer

40,A must visit in the area,A great way for tourists and local to spend a few hours with lots of food and souvenir stalls. A ride on the ferries wheel is a great way to gain an elevated view of the area,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bundyjames
40,Check it Out,"We were pleasantly surprised by the Santa Monica pier. I was dreading cheap arcades but what we found was an old school amusement park with very sweet carnival rides for children, as well as some restaurants, pier musicians, and a great view of the sunset. A pleasant surprise!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissMeda
40,Classic pier,"The Santa Monica Pier is a classic tourist destination but worth the visit. When I was there, we saw a sea lion at the end of the dock that was cute and plenty of people were fishing (and actually catching fish). There is also amusement rides and the end of route 66 sign that people take pictures with.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/letsdosomething12

50,"Santa Monica Pier, it’s a must go see…!","Another lunch-stop during our coach tour of western USA, and we find ourselves ‘dropped-off’ at the Santa Monica Pier for a couple of hours. Looking down onto the Pier from the road, you could tell that it’s a colourful and busy place, but you could also see that it is a tourist magnet. When down on the Pier, there are the usual ‘fairground-type’ things like roundabouts for the kids, mini ferris-wheel and swings, but there is also a mini ‘trapeze’ set up where your kids can actually learn how to swing in a trapeze act! Now that’s different. There are many tourist shops, Restaurants and market-type stalls selling all sorts of stuff, from ornaments and souvenirs to T-shirts, food and swim-wear. Then there is the sign that tells you that you are now at the western-most end of the famous Route 66, and it’s ‘The End of The Trail!’; and of course, this is the main photo-stop of the day! There is another sign further onto the Pier that then tells you that you have a mere 2448 miles to go, to get to the eastern-most end of Route 66! Now that trip’s just been added to our ‘Bucket-List for the future!’. Looking out to both the left and right sides of the Pier, the beach is very large at this point, and there are quite a lot of people on the beach typically sun-bathing, playing ball, swimming in the sea and generally having a good time; and of course, the weather is absolutely gorgeous. If you do get the opportuninty, you have to go and see it for yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IanJay
50,Lively Day Out,Had a great day here. Lots of live entertainment including the fantastic family group Liliac. Plenty of variety of food and drink. Good atmosphere .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dalufa
50,Southern California at its best,"The Santa Monica Pier is still one of the most iconic places in Southern California. It's energizing, lighthearted and a fun place to visit any time of day. You'll get a different experience at 7am than 7pm, but both are still interesting times to visit.Here's why the Santa Monica Pier is so cool:1. Nostalgia-inducing boardwalk with a fun amusement park2. World-class people watching3. Unique food carts and quintessential ""fair food""4. Stunning views of the Pacific Ocean5. Romantic place for a Ferris wheel ride6. Live music from local performers7. Learn about the history of Route 66",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/unabashedly
40,Iconic tourist destination you must visit if you're in the Santa Monica area,"The pier is famous and part of LA history. Route 66 ends at the pier and it's worth going to get your photo taken under the Route 66 end sign. The pier is also beautiful at night when it's all lit up, with the ferris wheel changing colors. On some summer nights, they also have bands playing which is fun. But once you see the pier, there's really not much to do there. The rides are very overpriced and none are made large enough to comfortably fit an adult. My kids (ages 9 and 11) rode a few and then asked to leave. They wanted to get down to the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heatherhJ3541NI

40,On tour with the Mclintons,"Stayed at Venice Beach for 3 nights, in an Air BNB a street back from the beach. Great venue, a little loud at night, close to shops, restaurants & public transports. Hired bikes and rode along the beach to Santa Monica lots of fun, Santa Monica again lots of good shopping & restaurants, we lucked upon a farmers market. Behind where we were staying at Venice is a street called Abbot Kinney a fabulous find again full of great restaurants and shopping. A must see if staying in Venice or Santa Monica or surrounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avenue12016
50,A day at the beach,Visited 3 of LA's famous beaches and this was the best option by far. Wandering up and down the pier was like transporting back to a location you would have seen in moviesNot far from the pier is a mile long promenade with shops and eating locations. This is a must visit option in LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shanen617

30,A lot of activity and very crowded,We popped onto the pier after a full day on the beach. It's a traditional old wooden pier with a few fishermen and great views across the beach either side.If you like fairground attractions there are a couple of rides. Most of the eateries are fast food style outlets and the traders are selling your traditional souvenirs. There are a few buskers which adds to the atmosphere but the whole place is very busy all day. As we were leaving in the early evening there were hundreds of people coming onto the pier to enjoy the evening ambience. Parking is nearby at a cost of 12 dollars regardless of how much time you stay and the rest rooms are kept clean n tidy by a regular janitorial service,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mistyb1302

50,What a Great Ending Point for The World Famous Route 66,"WE drove in and found a great spot for two cars to park together along an aisle end cap. Oddly enough, by the end of the day, two other convertibles found their say over to park beside our convertibles. Their drivers both reported a keen sense of bonding among the cars; kinda like it's own little miniature car showThere are some neat vendors and small shops to check out after you get your obligatory photo standing on the pier under the Route 66 ends here sign. Our visit was on a weekday, I can only imagine the walls and walls of humanity a typical weekend brings.We went sign shopping for the ""gotta have it"" garage sign along the way and wouldn't you know that we would find exactly what we were looking for. How did that happen? This is definitely a great place to go to watch people, beautiful people for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nascarbilly
50,Santa Monica Pier - family fun,"Pier was full of families walking around and looking at all the attractions. They have a lot of street vendors with permits on the pier, and a whole lot of fishermen on the pier taking up space, be careful guys get kinda mad if you walk down by their areas. It must have been big day, because a group of your athletic women and men where there giving free hugs to everyone.They have a roller coaster theme park area that is pretty pricey. I purchased 6 ice creams and paid $40 dollars. Each ride was $8 dollars to ride, so with a big family can cost a pretty penny.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josealvarez22
40,A world of Nations,I had no idea Santa Monica Pier was filled with so many tourist from around the world. All types of Europeans and languages were present the Thursday afternoon I took my Nigerian tourist friend to visit. It can get busy but it is a fun trip. Its a must see!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/205graciev
40,A Must Do Just Because,"You don't need to spend any money, just go to see the sight and the people! There are the typical carnival rides and then there is the main attraction - the wheel. There are gift shops, clothing, tourist chachki, food carts and then there is the Mariasol restaurant at the end, along with a historic map of Route 66. There was also a televised public debate with an audience going on while we were there. 'Street' performers, face painters and fishermen were all doing their thing along the pier. Great way to spend a few hours in the sun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crayonline
30,Visit to the famous Pier,We visited the Santa Monica pier on our last day of the tour and it was nice to see the beach and the Pier in glorious sunshine. There is the usual attractions associated with the Pier but we found a nice surprise further down the street in the Hotel California which made for a nice photo op. There are lots of bars and restaurants up and down the Promenade to choose from and people watching is always good fun.Great place to round off a trip to LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hawkmatthews
30,Touristy place,"Nice place with sea breeze. A lot is going on, full of people, if that is what you are up to. But the gift shops are full of cheap tourist stuff made in China, you cannot say that the place is clean, there re a few junk food eateries, plus a shrimp restaurant ( not sure how good it is but it does not look as fine dinning).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Unomi123

Lots of parking either at the pier location on the beach of two blocks in a garage very reasonably priced. I love to people watch and it didn't disappoint and I got some tourist photo opps also. Fun hour or so just hanging with a nice breeze on a September evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rhino2525
30,"Very touristy attraction in west Los Angeles, CA area","If you want to stand in line for very expensive, short carnival rides, this is your place. It's super crowded and lots of junk food.

Worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheThrifyFiftys
40,Touristy!,"Very touristy, as expected. Nice history lesson at the end of the pier explaining why it was built, how it was used and how it has survived. Very expensive and very mediocre eats from burgers to Bubba Gump and a few others here. Lots of vendors with touristy magnets and signs as well as a few musical performers. Glad I went, so I can say I've been there. Expensive parking as the head of the pier too. But then, everything in L.A. costs an arm and a leg to park at.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/g3times

50,Super cool pier,"Santa Monica pier was super pretty. I've never seen anything like it. My husband and I were visiting L.A. and decided to drive to the pier, which was a 30 minute drive from downtown L.A. where we were staying. We parked on the pier for $15 and then waltzed to the restrooms right next to the parking lot. It was an absolutely beautiful day. It's a great place for selfies and to spend time with someone awesome. I also got a mangonada from a fruit stand on the pier. It was very yummy, but I'm pretty sure they jipped me. Good thing I was in a good mood. It's not very big, but definitely go check it out. It looks like a southern California postcard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/payleec

10,Worst place in sta monica,"Don't get me wrong, santa monica is a nice place to be. I am specifically referring to the pier in question. It's like they crammed a carnival on the dock which is now very old very dirty very crowded and honestly without the beach as it's surrounding, I'd give it zero stars. Nothing to see here don't waste your time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/166gilbertl

A wristband for the rides at the pier were included in this, and this helped a lot as they were VERY expensive for what they were! However we were there mid week in the evening and got to go round on the ferris wheel about 6 times before they took us off, and the rollercoaster twice each time as they weren't busy. The small drop tower and Shark Frenzy were a lot of fun too.The pier itself offered beautiful views, good entertainment and some good food - Pier Burger in particular was a great choice for food as it was relatively cheap and a great burger.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelenE741
30,Super crowded on the weekend,"Good spot for outdoor activities, open beach, windy area.You need to be Super lucky if you want to park inside.Beware of some people who dressed up with costumes and intending to take photos with you.

40,Good day out,"We found the pier to be a good afternoon out and was on our list of things to do in California. We parked down the road for a flat fee of $20. The pier itself can be difficult for those using a wheelchair as the boards aren't easy to manoeuvre on.Our kids enjoyed the games and rides at Pacific Park. It wasn't too expensive.We really enjoyed the aquarium downstairs and our kids loved getting up close and touching some of the sea creatures that are different from home. Lots to do, many vendors, variety of food options.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MedusasRiot

50,Iconic and wonderful,"People all over the world have seen the Santa Monica pier portrayed in various movies and TV shows. The real thing is much better. Plenty of street vendors, beach type shops, seafood restaurants, and of course the iconic Santa Monica pier amusement center. No visitors to LA should skip this experience",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L6953YVpaull
50,Always enjoyable,"The variety of humanity, smells and sounds just totally amazes me at the Santa Monica Pier no matter when I visit.

Go with an open mind and take it in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/697dianneh

40,Worth the look,Enjoyed the half day at the pier. Parking in area is a complete rip off. Best to load a parking app on your smartphone and find some meter parking if you can. I would do it if I were a first time visitor. Next time - I think hiring a bike would make it worth a second look. Street entertainers in vicinity are excellent. Felt very safe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johntT8484OM
20,Tired and touristy,"Not worth a detour. Scruffy and very tired, particularly when compared to piers in UK and elsewhere in Europe; it could have been so much better but probably beyond recovery now.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FliesM20P
30,Not that interesting,"Not that interested in venues such as this. The old pier structure is great, but the carnival atmosphere is just not that exciting. Vendors are overpriced. Suggest walking around it and looking at it, but not doing anything on it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EagleTravel29
50,Something for everyone,"What a superb place to visit !!!The pier has it all , fun fair rides for all the family , lots of shopping opportunities for souvenirs and nice places to eat , it's a definite must visit attraction.No hesitation in recommending 10/10",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarekLontour
50,lovely to check out while passing through area,"We were in area on a coach trip, stopped off here for about 3 hours to stroll pier & beach. Lovely warm day, busy tourist area, but we really enjoyed it. Plenty of choice up pier if fancy bite to eat. Got some great pictures aswell.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gatesy150
40,Worth the Visit,"While it was interesting to walk around Santa Monica Pier, we really didn't find ourselves actually doing anthing on the Pier. As it is fairly iconic it is definitely worth the visit though!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAH_Chicago_Paris
30,Average,The most authentic thing of this pier is it's wooden construction that creaks under the cars that drive up there. The rest is tourist shops and restaurants and we've all seen plenty of those.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wub67
20,Not overwhelmed,The pier looked a bit tired as did the attractions and the prices from the vendors was super high one place charging $6 for 1 scoop of ice cream!It was very busy when we visited with a lot of random vendors some playing 'music' if you can call it that and others selling random stuff.There were quite a few homeless people on the pier begging from tourists and a lot sleeping on the benches.The best bit was watching a seal playing with the fishermen on the end of the pier nicking their bait each time they cast a line.I wouldn't rush back to the pier itself but the beach and Santa Monica shops are nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FioHu
30,Average,"Bit put off by the homelessness and some dodgy people hanging around but if you ignore all that and walk down, it's a pretty nice beach. Beach itself is clean and quite peaceful as we went on a week day so not much crowd. We walked from this beach to Venice beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shedee
50,Iconic Santa Monica Pier lives up to the hype,"As a local I never get tired of visiting the Santa Monica pier where everyday feels like vacation! My family and I love the entertainment, rides, shops, and of course breath taking views of the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N1261ZAinfo
40,I love it !,"I've seen some piers this year and Santa Monica Pier is still my favourite. Especially in the evening it's an amazing place to watch the sundown.Besides that, they offer food, some roller coaster rides are available, people do music (some do that really really good) and you can buy souvenirs in the gift shops :)I like to finish the day by just strolling around for a little while :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3leah
50,Taste of So Cal,"Fun to stroll and people watch. Lots of cute shops, ice cream and food options. Rides for kids. Old school feel of carnival with beautiful views of beach, ocean and city. Fun place to bring the visiting family then head to 3rd street promenade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelernottourist
40,a must to visit but not so special,"a must to visit but it is not so special actually. just perfect for a 20-30 stroll to see everything. Some artists performing songs, playing instruments etc on the Pier, there is a small leisure park for children and 2-3 restaurants. The Mexican restaurant at the end of the Pier is okay and not too pricey. It's a pity that you see so many drug consuming and dealing people on your way to the Pier. It's no aggressive atmosphere but I wish they would light the ways to the city and show more police presence.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/609maximilianh
40,Tips for visiting,Go early to get a parking spot right on the pier. My friend and I arrived about 930 on a weekday and there was tons of parking and barely anyone on the beach.There are washrooms available.For changing clothes: lines are long so changing there can be a time waster.Wear your swim suit there.Around noon the crowds start piling in.There are lots of places to eat availableYou can also rent bikes!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/305chelseaj
20,Not that special,It's a fair on a pier. It's not that much fun and way to crowded.There are a lot of homeless people near the entrance to the pier. Just ignore them and they ignore you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/941bartl
50,Great fun!,We spent a few hours on the pier one day. There were lots of restaurants and shops and some very talented street performers! We rode the big Ferris wheel and there were some great views from the top!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/veronicat116
50,Great experience,The beach was clean and there was an array of street performers to watch. We ate at Bubba gump (delicious) and walked the boardwalk! Great time!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsKiesha
30,Super crowded,"The place is nice to walk and go to the beach but the first time we went (weekend) to get parking was imposible and at the end we decided to leave.Second time we went it was crowded but not as much, at least we got parking close to the pier.As I said the place is nice but for me wasn't worthed to stay stock in traffic and try to get parking for hours. There was some parking lots further away but quite expensive.The beach is big and there are nice restaurants along the pier.We went for a walk to the main street with all the shops and was ok.I think this can be a place for visiting once unless you are crazy about the beach. I'm not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nazlyl2015
20,Not My Idea of Fun!,"My husband and I only walked on the pier because I wanted my 10,000 steps. I am not a big fan of places like this. A lot of OK restaurants, carnival like atmosphere, too many people, junky stuff to waste your money on.....I could go on but I do love the water and the lights on the Ferris wheel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edie0208
40,Great Day activity!!,"A worthwhile walk on the pier filled with restaurants, artists,singers, a ferries wheel, fishing off the pier and a beautiful view of the beach and the mountains.Tremendous amount of activity and people watching..an overal fun activity",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rockdoc7
50,you have to see it yourslef,"best to go there at the very morning when it is not too crouded, many fishermen, at the end of the pier there is shop with suvenirs about route 66",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexaKPL
30,Busy walk,"If this were your first visit to Santa Monica beach, your eyes will be drawn to the ferries wheel. Lots of vendors to keep you interested.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lapyang
50,Very nice day!,"We went to the pier for the Fourth of July, it was a bit crowded, but bearable. We got the all day wristband, definitely worth it. Clean and all employees happy and friendly!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/427michellen
40,Relaxing walk from here to Venice beach,"Caught the red, then yellow bus from Dolby theatre. Walked on the pier then along the board walk to Venice Beach (5km). Lunch in a cute cafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevingO3301JW
40,Great fun on the pier.,"Loved the arcade, we changed a 20 bill into 80 quarters and had a blast! Driving games, bowling games, coin moving games, tickets coming at us and we walked away with a small bouncy ball but loved it.The pier was fun, but as we had been to theme parks all week we didn't need to go on the rides.It was Labour Day so very busy but well worth the trip",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ToniF32
40,Park at 3rd Street structures and walk here,"The pier is good to stroll but you don't want to spend too much time there unless you're going to fish or sit on a couple rides. The food and casual walking is best done on 3rd Street Promenade. The Pier is good for some coastal photo ops and selfies. Other than that, you won't get much out of it. You can however, walk down to the beach from the Pier and hit the water or layout (if you come prepared for a beach day). It's your typical old school pier and that's it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaeldavid30
30,Not like the movies,"Dirty, worn down and not as nice as in the movies. At bit expensive. No need to go here unless you want to take pretty picture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josefinep197
30,Meh!,"Other than a nice place to have an evening stroll, it is disappointing. Several vendors with different wares (your name written on a grain of rice, etc). Standard T-shirt and cap vendors. An abundance of fast food. A couple of street musicians.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rhpatt29
50,YA GOTTA WALK THE PIER,"Whether you're going to drop a fortune and go for a ride, stroll up and down and enjoy the sights, sounds and buskers or grab a bite the pier is a treat. Mid afternoon is a quiet time as the place comes alive at night. If you're going to be there for less than 3 hours go right up and park on the pier. Longer? Drive over to 2nd ave. The city parking lot is only $7 flat rate and it's a short walk.Make sure to go to the end, climb up the stairs and get the experience from all angles. Maybe you'll luck in and see the duty seal at the end looking for treats from the fishermen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SenorGancho
30,Touristy,"The title about sums it up. Nothing authentic, nothing unique, nothing worthwhile going back to. Sunset/people watching might be interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NavyJAG
20,Tourist Heaven,"The Monica Pier is nothing more than a tourist trap. It appeals to teenagers who are looking to hook up. Even visitors to the US, selfie sticks in hand, find little of interest here. It is not well maintained, so there is trash everywhere. Do yourself a favor. Take a photo in front of the iconic sign at the entrance to the pier, and skip the pier itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottandmaryg
50,Drinks by the Ocean,Had a wedding to attend in the area and came to Santa Monica to re visit 3rd Street Promenade. It was wonderful to sit and sip a mimosa while the city bustled by.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheresaBRN
40,"Crowded, crowded, and crowded",This place is nostalgic and beautiful but it is so crowded. You almost can do nothing because of the crowd.I enjoyed just walking and then go to downtown which is exciting. The beach is good for taking pictures and walking.There are showers to wipe out the sands :) Yay!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/payamf1
40,Worth Visiting if you're in LA,It is certainly worth visiting if you're in LA. If you're driving you should note that there's a lot of parking space and it is decently priced. There are a lot of places to eat and just walk around and enjoy the breeze and ocean view.Worth noting that it is super busy...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackTheExplorer
50,Something for wvweyone,"Came here on two seperate days one time on a Segway from Venice beach, great selection of eateries, rides, shopping and entertainment. Fantastic place for sunset!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tashleesmakeup
50,Wow,"Don't waste any more time if you in LA go to see this great pier is fool of fun (street artist 👨‍🎤, cocktail bar with a breathtaking view ecc..) very nice place all together...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Georgejung13
40,Fun / Super Crowded,"The pier is like old time East Coast Summer activity. There are people everywhere, lots of things to do, tons of food and the fishing locals provide entertainment. Try the Mexican restaurant at the end of the pier for margaritas and nachos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DragonLady90292
40,Must see,Everyone should experience this pier at least once. So much history. A fun walk with the family. Great local talent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandraaV6468CL
50,Peer into a fun time!,"The Pier is a collection of all your favorite snacks, carnival games, and theme park rides. While incredibly family friendly, it can also be a fun date spot just to help make you feel like a kid again. Even if you're not a big fan of rides the Ferris Wheel is a must. With the glorious view of Santa Monica and the ocean you'll truly be in awe. The best time to visit the pier and ride the Ferris wheel is the afternoon, and sunset. Make sure to come on through after a day of exploring the 3rd Street Promenade as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sethdanielgoldman
40,Lovely Afternoon,We spent an afternoon here while visiting Santa Monica and we had a great time. We purchased the unlimited ride band for our 7 year old which cost $17 and she loved it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gresty35
50,Pier,Loved the pier its so busy with lots going on.Bubba Gump has a great wee shop with cheap gifts to buy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kinkin123
50,A must see,"Great and enjoyable place. We spent about an hour here just walking around and taking photos. Unique place! Parking was reasonable at $3, per hour. Several places to eat and several attractions offers. Beautiful views of the surrounding areas from the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Krr1975
50,"If you have lots of time to spare, go here!","Santa Monica Pier is very lively! I had an amazing time here. My boyfriend and I spent about 4 hours just around the area, we played games, ate a lot lol, watched the people swimming, we also enjoyed the scenic view of the ocean. You can do a lot of things here, as well as ride the Ferris wheel and other rides that the pier has.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IraTarynBlanco
40,Early morning trip,As I'm sure Santa Monica Pier gets extremely croweded with tourist as most places in the area do. I decided to go early Saturday morning around 9 am. It turns out I was able to get there with minimal traffic and was able to find a decent parking spot. I. Most stores were still opening up but I was happy that it wasn't crowed. The views were great with out the shadow of someone's selfie stick. I was able to get my souvenirs with no lines and was able to sit on a bench with my breakfast and look out into the water with no one around. It did seem Coffee Bean was the only place that had breakfast besides the larger restaurant at the end of the pier. I then went down to the beach which there were a few people but nothing crazy. I was able to lay my towel out right infront of the water.I suggest going early for a quieter experience! I had a great morning!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/20lauriea
40,Beautiful In The Evening,"We looked forward to our visit to Santa Monica Pier, as it seemed like one of those iconic places in songs, movies and television.To be honest, we were a bit underwhelmed on the day that we visited; admittedly an Autumn weekday during school time and the weather was not great. It was disappointing that the rides were closed. One of the park attendants, kindly agreed to start up the roller-coaster so that the boys could enjoy it, which I thought was very generous. However, a lot of the restaurants and cart-shops were shut, and we were VERY disappointed by the aquarium.In any case, we decided not to judge it on one visit, so we came back on a different evening.WOW, it could not have been more different!The place was buzzing, the general vibe was more festive, and everything was open. I'd never tried funnel cake, and it was an instant favourite with everyone. (especially in the cold weather.)We left with a much better impression... we'll probably go back on our next visit to LA, but definitely in the evening only.One word of warning, there's a pretty steep hill leading up out of the pier... my elderly father and mother-in-law had to stop a couple of times to rest. (They have some mobility issues).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmigoMarlz
30,It was good to see,"Santa Monica pier was good to see, can tick it off the list. It is iconic. The pier had lots of people in a good way. The gift shops are average but the atmosphere was relaxing even with the crowd. They have a coffee shop, bubba gump shrimp, rides for the kids. Sunset was beautiful.Worth a look!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BecksPoint
50,Fun,I've been up and down the west coast shoreline from Washington state to San Diego and so far this beach is my favorite. If your looking for remote getaway this isn't it. Its live here people moving all directions. Come prepared with a beach umbrella and water.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/818je
50,Beautiful view!,"Great place to walk around and enjoy the view! It's great for families, couples and even a solo trip! You can just walk around the Pier, dine, shop, go to the rides or simply walk around the beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gla8421
40,If you've got the time why not go,"Beautiful spot, the ocean is beautiful and the pier is full of over priced little touristy things. It's not a must do but it defiantly do it if you've got some spare time to kill. Super close to shops if you wanted to hit up some classic clothing stores after and the food around it is pretty great too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrittanyG1168
40,Fun place to visit!,"Got to park right on the pier! Parking was very reasonable. Fun to walk down to the end of the pier. The ferris wheel was huge! The vendors were not in your face. There were entertainers singing and playing instruments, but they weren't pushy about collecting money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebStr2016
50,Awesome sight!,"Everyone has seen the SMP in a movie or TV show. It was great to see it up close. Lots of vendors, perfirmers, rides and of course food...definitely need to stop here as part of your trip to LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Methodluv
50,Enjoyed the view of sea.,The view of ocean from here is wonderful. There is a beach just beside it and good street shopping is available. Food is also available. The pacific park is good for children to enjoy with rides. BEWARE of snatchers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/harshithat
10,Very dirty and stinky,This area is the worst of Santa Monica. Urinated places of homeless people as well as the main Shopping Promenade of Santa Monica.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindasK4451NS
40,Great Pier and Beach,Great place to go on weekends. The pier is charming with great views on both sides. Good boardwalk food and shops. Try Big Deans across the street,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PepePitMD
40,A typical busy seaside pier,"Busy, packed with tourists like us. Silly souvenirs and general tat. Just how it should be. Definitely worth a visit- a nice evening stroll Lovely view of sunset",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdinburghMjh
50,Lots to do and see on the pier!,Many activities available on the pier. Many performers and artist willing to work for tips!They have different rides available as well. You can get a really cute picture on the pier with the mountains in the background.There is a yummy churro stand that one should check out!Parking seemed difficult to get to on the pier but you can park along the city streets and walk to the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/708sarahk
40,Nice Walk,"We went to the pier on a hot day. The breeze coming off the ocean cooled it to a comfortable temperature. It was a look at what California is imagined as: impromptu band, a man dancing wildly, fishermen fishing shark, beggars, men sculpting and people walking and watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ROMENTraveler2014
50,West Coast Icon,"What a lively place, and with that famous sign over the entrance. It's a real tourist attraction and a must see if you are in the area. the pier has attractions and restaurants aplenty. It reminds me of Brighton pier, or some such place in England (but with better weather!). The beach along the Santa Monica coastline is long, flat and beautifully kept. There is a cycling/jogging track all the way along as well for general use. It is so beautiful there, the Pacific looks absolutely stunning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ghk1857
50,End of the Mother Road,"We traveled Route 66 all the way from Illinois. A welcome sight to see the Santa Monica Pier at the end of the road. It's an American icon. Old boards large enough to hold a small amusement park, small self parking lot, and lots of eateries and gift shops. Fun place to watch the ocean, people swimming and enjoying the beach. A festive place. More parking available off Ocean Ave nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/988chuckb
30,Stroll along the pier,There is some old charm about the pier and worth the visit but food available at smaller food places poor quality. Great for families spending a day out,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hammr
30,Old Fashioned Pier with Carnival Games,"The SM Pier is not worth a trip only to see the Pier, but if you are already visiting Santa Monica, it's probably worth taking a look at. But, don't go on the weekends, it's really just too crowded. I like the bumper cars and the view from the end of the Pier. I used to play beach volleyball on the sand courts right next to the Pier and listen to the free concerts while playing volleyball, which was a terrific experience! Exercise and free entertainment at the same time.The Pier itself isn't that great, and of course, there's the homeless problem in Santa Monica which doesn't help the Pier's attractiveness. If you are visiting the Third Street Promenade, you might as well walk over to the Pier, too, and check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T5193HZmelissad
50,Amazing place,Love this place. Excellent and tipical from here. Far from city. I recomended To wear sunscreen. Parking available,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexandrabraun
50,Fabulous,"For someone like me that has a 6 years old, I'm always looking for ways to make the trip fun for her. This place has all much activities that my daughter didn't want to leave. They make your money worth. The rides let you do the rides twice so that was nice. We bought the unlimited rides for my daughter and it was worth it. Nice setting, very romantic, reminds me of back home",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelledC6707YU
30,Take it or leave it,"The pier is iconic so it's reason enough to visit but there isn't a lot to do there. A few restaurants on the pier itself, a lot of little popup stands selling souvenirs, and the amusement park... do take a ride on the ferris wheel. The pier is also filled with people fishing off of all 3 sides. The beaches go on forever on either side with an icredible view for miles. IF you plan to hit the beach give yourself most of the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/todb242
30,Super busy pier,"Incredibly busy when we visited which was on the Sunday before labour day. Packed with people and hard to find a good spot. Had to buy a sun umbrella but don't pay more than $10, prices start at $15 but can definitely go to $8. Water here is cool and the waves awesome but the water is dirty. May be due to the amount of people in such a small area but it wasn't crystal by any means. A good place to see if you're around the area but I would avoid public holidays. Also, the water is quite a walk from the parking so be aware of that. Final point is there is only one set of showers to wash the sand off you. The queue was unreal. They need to fix this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DannyD34
40,Pier,"Loved being on the pier - it was a little windy but that actually helped lower the heat. There was entertainment, seal sightings, Ferris wheel rides and loads of people watching opportunities. A fun day out for families, couples and friend groups",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/816emjc
50,A beautiful day on the SM Pier!,I am a lifelong resident of Santa Monica and rode the Ferris Wheel for the first time - oh what fun! The ride operators were so nice and the view - stunning. Dinner at the Lobster was delicious.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cjhulagirl1975
50,Our first US experience,Must do!! We visited on the day we arrived and were not disappointed. The Mexican restaurant at the end has good food and beer and is not too expensive. A must do US experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryF1956
40,Lots to see,"Great place to walk around even for the people watching. We tried a couple restaurants, the roller coaster and walked along the pier and the beach. I'd go back for sure. The parking was fairly reasonable as well: $3/ hr up to a max of $15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarrafed
50,Everyone should visit at least once in theif life,"Great park experience right on the water. Really fantastic for kids and teens alike. Rollercoaster actually extends out into the water...huge ferris wheel, plenty to eat and drink for everyone. Walkable from the bike path, easy access to the town and hotels. It's a great way to spend a couple of hours with or without kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jkarr11
40,Fun in the sun,Enjoyed visiting this historic land mark. The view from the Ferris wheel is well worth the ticket price.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/963annemariet
40,A place to be at sunset !,"Great place for sunset. Otherwise it is noisy and crowded, especially on weekends and holidays, but it is the End of Route 66, so it is a place to visit !!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frankhS1710WH
40,Santa Monica Pier,"Really fun place to visit with kids. Rides are pricey for what they are but I completely understand the cost given the location. The beach was very fun and dynamic: lots of people, kids, and surfers. Definitely worth experiencing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cecismith70
50,Wow a great place,"What a fantastic place , you can park at 4th street and it's a short walk to the pier . The atmosphere is fab lots of things to do and seeThe Ferris wheel at Pacific park is a must do the views are amazingThe coffee house on the pier serves good coffee. If your patient and look into the sea we saw dolphins and sealsThe beach is really nice but be careful the breeze makes it feel cooler than it is don't get burntA must do if you are visiting LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/665taraj
30,Hot and crowded,Pier and boardwalk is a great feature to Santa Monica but the Pier is too touristy and crowded. Bad food and cheap tourist trinkets cover the Pier. Homeless are plentiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marlos1
50,Beautiful pier,"Always something to do and see, this pier offers many fantastic restaurants a great roller coaster, and views of Santa Monica beach, many tourists and locals come to the pier to sit at the bench or walk around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mrtravelbee
40,Iconic spot,"Typical pier activities / amusements, chain restaurants and takeaways, musicians, fishermen. Excellent views of the sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/241carole
40,Great American pier,"Was a fun place to visit, great that it was open late at night.Unfortunately they don't let single riders on the ferris wheel, which is a pity as a great way to see santa Monica and why I ubered there from Venice. Fortunately a lovely family split their group so I could ride with one of them, was great to meet such friendly kind locals.Roller coaster was fun even though old school.Pier burger was delicious!Great fishing from the end of the pier and fish cleaning stations available.Good buskers and fun vibes.Avoid bubba Gump shrimp, very rude and poor service.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/766kathrynl
50,Touristic visit,Good to walk around near sunset if you are not a beach-goer. It gets quick crowded to look for parking spaces and eatery around that time. Sea breezes from the Pacific Ocean is always nice for everybody.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/konstanza_sf
50,Visit early in the day,We visited prior to doing s 6 hour tour of L.A and then returned to pier at 6pm (on a Saturday) after tour had finished but you couldn't move so we didn't stay. Fab seeing a sign on the pier to note the end of Route 66!! Lots to do but very busy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gittinsclan
50,A Bit of History,"This is a nice place to visit if you are nearby. It's a lovely old-fashioned pier with an arcade, rides, and places to eat. Yes, Bubba Gump's has made its way in, as other modern places, but it still overall has the look and feel of the past.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoctorRetired
40,Pot everywhere.,We got to the pier a. It late for our overpriced burgers and chips.Locals where out and all you could smell was pot.I don't mind this but just saying!People where fishing off the end and plenty of different food and stall to choose from all priced to suit a tourist.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CraigR819
50,very hottt,went to the pier on a hot day good vibes everyone happy the sea breeze was kooling heaps to see and do nice places to eat and theres a big wheel to ride on would take kids there all the time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marunui187
20,Too crowded,"We went there twice to visit but just too crowded to even walk out on it. The street entertainment was great but that is the only positive. beach itself was crowded, hard to walk and enjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lillian50
30,More carnival then pier.,I thought there would be a lot more restaurants and cute shops. Very disappointing! I'm sure the arcade and amusement park are nice if you have kids. I was looking for more of the San Francisco Pier 39 experience. Not worth the $12 parking fee.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kittyme2
30,Start of my road trip,"I am driving route 66 backwards, so had to visit this iconic landmark. Pretty much as I expected. Parking next to the pier was a reasonable $12",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C7980BFmikew
40,A great landmark,An amazing landmark of the LA coast. Big pier but a bit touristy for my liking. Still a great place to visit & to people watch. Plenty to do on the pier & nearby.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/McAnnie1
50,Day in LA,"The Pier is a must do...even if you can't actually ride the attractions. It's a beautiful beach. We live close to Panama City Beach, Florida and it was an awesome experience to see such a difference between the beaches. My opinion remains that Panama City beaches are pretty hard to overcome. The white sandy shorelines along with our beautiful blue waters are mesmerizing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/194jameso
50,Route 66,The end of a perfect trip. Sorry to see it! But a must if you have just done the mother road. Your excited that your there and then the realisation that your nearly going home sinks in. Shop at the very end of the pier (the last route 66 shop ) is very good for those last minute gifts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nelprc
30,Iconic pier but very costly,"A fun place to have said you have visited, but the amusement rides are certainly not worth the amount charged. A 45 second ""roller coaster"" ride was 8.50 and didn't do much rolling.Visit, but don't plan on it being a destination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/37Alex
10,Get out fast,"As much as this attraction looks fun, it is a mad house filled with locals and creepy people. If you have to go get there at 5",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/802gailt
40,Day at the beach & pier,"Family of 5 spent a great day at Santa Monica Beach & Pier. Parked at lot 3, walked along seafront, sunbathed and swam. We had a late lunch/early dinner at Rusty's Surf Ranch. Service & food was excellent and ideal for us as a family that had come from the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whatsitallaboutalfie
30,It's a pier,"It's pretty much what it says it is . Not really much different than what we have in England . Well looked after well with some fair rides , street entertainers , food , and a great view out to sea . The big wheel is a must and gives you a lovely view up and down the coast . If you are down this what there is no reason not to have a walk around has a very tame rollercoaster that young children and adults can go on and not scare themselves to death .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Corkey1972
30,Plenty to see,Was there on a hot day on a holiday weekend. Surprisingly it wasn't horribly busy. There's plenty to see. Quite a few people selling beach umbrellas and fresh fruit. Everyone was pretty chill. Only thing that was a total turnoff were the bathrooms. They were disgustingly filthy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Csmith89
20,End of Route 66,"Having completed Route 66, had to go on pier for obligatory photos at the sign, this is in the middle of the pier and it seemed if there were lots of successful completions as there were lots of people having photos at the sign!!! (Did not see this many on our travels!)We had a very expensive snack and drink in one of the outlets on the pier.We all agreed that it's a tourist thing for the sign to be there, and it should be at the end of the route at ocean and Lincoln intersection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mr_biff
30,Tired,It's fun but crowded but that's to be expected. Views are beautiful and we saw seals in the water around the pylons at the end of the pier!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kathy348
20,Typical tourist spot,"Crowded, expensive, overrated. A waste of time and money. I should have known better - well at least I can say ""I've been there!"" :-(",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HFD69
40,California vibes,"You haven't been in California if you haven't been in Santa Monica Pier. Totally worth it.Tip: If You're going to stay for less than 2 hours, park ON the pier. Yes, drive in with the car. If you need more than 2 hours, then the parking lot near the pier is cheaper.Stroll around, feel the vibes, and enjoy. If You're lucky you can spot a seal playing under the pier.And Don't miss the gymnastics are, 200 meters south the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/691carlesc
50,Great view and vibe,By far one of the tourist hot spot. It will be crowded but the views are worth it. This is the end of Route 66: another milestone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fabercas
30,BIG Tourist spot,"This is a place for the tourist, there are rides and places to get things to eat, but for me, I have lived here most of my life, and i wouldn't go again, I had a visitor from out of town, so I took them",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeinMalibu
30,"So-so, but we visited at night","The rides at the pier seemed very expensive for being rides aimed mostly at kids, and we had very bad phone reception so couldn't take part in any Pokemon raids (which was one of the reasons my friend brought us here). However the views from the ferris wheel were spectacular even at night, and the other guests seemed to be having fun on the other rides. The games arcade looked fun but we didn't have any cash to spend on the games unfortunately. Plus the end of the historic route 66 is here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tawreh
50,Love this beach!!,I have friends that live right across from the pier. It stays crowded.till closing any night. A great adventure for family n wheel chair friendly. .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vhgoudeau
30,Reminds me of Jersey shore,Kids will love the pier with all its rides. Seemed kinda cheesy and very crowded to me. Probably worth tolerating for your kids sake.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twinkies
30,Tail end of Rt 66,"Must see the end of the original route 66. Touristy as expected and parking can be a nightmare, but worth walking around the pier to experience the westernmost point of route 66. Filled with the usual types of vendors but fun to spend an afternoon. there are amusement rides if children are involved.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Larry10803
50,Great! Must do!,"It is lovely to come here all time around, but in the evening the atmosphere is especially great. It is fairly small but plenty to do and to shop. The restaurants are too expensive and we decided to go into town instead, but otherwise this is a must do!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natalieb382
50,All roads lead to the Pier,We caught Lyft to get from Downtown LA to Santa Monica Pier and it was a beautiful day to hit the beach. The Pier offers beautiful views of the ocean and Malibu. The iconic pier is a delight to stroll around and loads of fun. We sipped on cherry icee's while watching the rides and the beautiful ocean before taking a (long) walk to Venice Beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Candz214
30,Santa Monica Pier,"Lovely pier full of charm. Very busy on weekends. I felt it was too crowded. Lots of food stalls, free entertainment, carnival rides and eateries. Good ocean views and beach views. We ate on the main road with views of the pier where it was much quieter and had lovely local restaurants with tasty food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/806enzag
50,Excellent Day at the Beach Whenever Visiting Los Angeles,"Santa Monica is a small community located within 8 miles (13 km.) from Los Angeles. Santa Monica itself is a small (only 8.5 sq. mi.) trendy seaside community, that is an excellent option for dining and recreation whenever visiting the Los Angeles area. The beach is spectacular.The Santa Monica Pier is over 100 years old and it's located right on Santa Monica State Beach where you can find plenty of food and activities. The pier has plenty of restaurants, bars, carnival style foods (like ice cream, funnel cakes etc.). It offers outdoor summer activities, music concerts, arcade, and an amusement park with a carrousel and a large ferris wheel. Different tours can also be booked as several tour operators are available in the area. Segway and electric bicycle tours and rentals are also available. Locals tend to roller skate, cycle, jog or walk the general area since Santa Monica is relatively small. You can also enjoy a day at the Santa Monica State Beach. I also found out that the pier is located at the very end of Route 66 and interestingly, the character of Popeye was inspired by a local Sailor. You can read his story and see an actual picture of him. I enjoyed my day and hope you do too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Una_Chica_A_Fuego
40,Amazing!!!,"We had a lot of fun and ate very tasty ice cream. For dinner we ate at the famous ""Bubba Gump"" and I was a little bit disappointed. We ate hamburgers and Cesar salad which wasn't the tastiest dinner we had eaten. But maybe the shrimp dishes are better. Over all it was a nice experience and we would like to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Caromilla1
50,Great for family's!,"This place is better in the evening if you ask me. The Ferris wheel lit up against the coast is a sight to see. There's restaurants and carnival rides. Vendors and performers lined up against the pier. An LA must see, and great for tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aajramirez
40,"Good, old fashioned nostalgic fun!","I didn't think I would enjoy myself at the Pier thinking it was just dinky rides and large crowds. That was until my boyfriend brought me into the arcade to play ""a few"" games. $10 worth of quarters turned into another $5, then another $5, oh hell I'm having fun let's throw in another $10. It was worth every penny.My only complaints were that some of the games being very old, were eating quarters and not recognizing that you'd paid. A few also seemed to not be working properly. Also, as is typical, the prizes you receive for your tickets are pretty dumb. We opted to trade ours in for candy instead.I had such a wonderful time, i will definitely come back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShannonC9891
40,Worth a visit,"Santa Monica is that place that you always saw on TV, so its 'skyline' its already known.However, it worth a visit.It's nice to see the sunset from the beach of the fair, but it's nice to know that, usually, is especially overcrowded.There are several attractions and places to lunch and dinner.Parking close to the pier, or crossing the avenue, there are car parks for a fee as well.Nice for adults but, especially, for children and toddler.In my opinion, a little bit old fashioned, but this is part of this pier too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PezFish
40,Great fun,"Great fun pier. Rides will never challenge those of a big theme park, but for $20 unlimited rides, plenty of rides and great couple of hours can be spent here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aitkeng
50,Worth visiting,"Great day out for visitors to LA hire a bike across pier good fun. Sand on the beach nice, soft and pebble free which is bonus m.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/londongirl19742017
30,Worth a short visit,"It's nice but not nearly as nice as other piers I've visited, for example pier 39 in San Francisco is much much nicer. We went there at midday, quite packed and returned in the night since our hotel gave us free tickets for the Ferris wheel. Much more enjoyable! But not nice enough to stay for dinner. All in all, I would recommend a short visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Silviaoxx
40,A WORTHWHILE STROLL!,"Whether you are looking to ride a ferris wheel, watch the entertainers, grab a bite to eat, stroll through the shops, or just people watch.....you can do it all here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelcindy
40,Beautiful place to visit,The santa monica pier is very nice and it has an excellent view! It is full of people but it is pleasant to go and walk around!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/florash
50,Nice place on the beach side,"Drive to Santa Monica pier car parking, lot's of parking available for $12 per day.A place with lots of activity, shops, restaurant, artists.Nice view to the beach and the pier is nice setup.Weekend lot's of people. But fun with all the activities.Some great young bands were there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/visionbyrm
30,Packed,"There were lots of people, food, and amazing street performers. One visit is enough. Unless you're really into packed destinations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/929larau
40,Great visit,"Visiting the Santa Monica Pier is a must every time you're in Los Angeles. There's lots of fun activities, the view is great and there's a playing arcade as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lara1070
10,Dirty place!,Absolutely terrible; just made for taking money from the tourists..dirty place! overfilled not only with tourists but homeless people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tooltime35
50,A must in Los Angeles,A really cool pier to relax eat and enjoy the view. Even though it can get really crowded it's an amazing experience.The pier features a lot of attractions like the park with it's rolercoaster and many other things. Souvenirs can also be bought all over the pier.Must see for everyone in every age category!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jack3s
40,Finally at Pier,"We had visited Santa Monica many times before and never the Pier. This time it was on my list to do. We parked at least a couple of miles away and walked there which provides people watching at its best! At the Pier we played several of the carnival games, ate at the foody hot dog stand - yummy! And watched the boardwalk show with my husband a ""white tall man"" (term used at the show ) getting selected out of the crowd to dance. It was a good show using racial slurs to exemplify how easily people judge based on color of the skin & national origin. It was well done and ended on a good note! It was a great afternoon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luv2travel8
30,A little touristy for a local,"Fun to see and take pictures but sooo busy and too touristy for locals, especially on the weekend. We brought our bikes and rode down the coast and enjoyed some drinks on Venice boardwalk and ate breakfast on Abbot Kinney Blvd. The crowd in Venice is a bit mature for young family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/843christinew843
50,A must visit in Los Angeles,"Quite a scenic 75 minutes public transportation from Hollywood Boulevard, worth the trip to experience a totally different and breezy atmosphere. Nice selection of cafés and bars, and a relaxing walk on the promenade",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Belgium12points
40,End of route 66,For us this was then end of an epic road trip along route 66.The pier is lively and vibrant.Sunset is great to watch from the Pier.Doesn't disappoint and worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mandyw30
40,Lovely stroll,Walked down from our hotel enjoyed walking down the beach and pier. On the pier there were several performers which were fun the watch. At the end there were some bleachers where you could watch the sea and let the world go by. So. E food options on the pier but we didn't eat here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LadyDogChampion85
40,Exploring while on vacation,My family and I were exploring while on vacation and we stumbled across the Santa Monica pier. We have never been to California and we found this on accident. We all loved it . There were interesting people and events going on with plenty of food options as well. There was also cool little shops everywhere. Even though it was packed there were still places to sit and hang out by . We even saw a seal at the end of the pier. My teenage kids really enjoyed this place. There were some great areas for photos too . Place is clean and has restrooms available. One of the highlights on our trip so far . Would definitely recommend and return too .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lous593
30,Iconic but full of religious zealots,It's a great location and a must see at the end of Route 66. Very popular but rather spoiled by megaphone weilding zealots proclaiming the rapture and/or intoning sinners to repent before it's too late..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1961collier
20,"Fun to see, once",It is a fun place to walk and people watch. Typical souvenir shops. There is a Mexican restaurant at the end of the pier and Bubba Gump Shrimp at the beginning. I was amazed at how big the actual beach was.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunsher
50,End of the Line for Historic Route 66,Great place to spend the afternoon. It is the end of historic Route 66 and there are a few signs commemorating this - plenty of people taking photos with the sign. There are things like a carousel and mini amusement park which seemed to be popular with families with kids but it's a great place to people watch and just spend the afternoon enjoying the sun. Amazing that this beach is literally minutes away from downtown Santa Monica and a Metro train ride away from downtown LA - it has a much more laid back atmosphere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DABSMO
40,A little nostalgia,"The pier is kind of a mix bag. You have performers and musicians, fishermen, carnival like area for kids, and some restaurants. It has a bit of a nostalgic feel, something from a simpler time or maybe it just reflects all the movies and tv shows it has been part of.The best part for me was just walking through and taking in the sights, including catching a glimpse of a young seal below in the water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philipl613
50,No place like it,"Amazing, wonderful, nothing like itWhen weather too hot it was cold thereJust seat watch solo shows and enjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mohamedsE6609BY
40,The same of GTA!!!,That's amazing: GTA is the same. It's a good place to visit. Santa Monica in general in my opinion is the best city in CA. I would like to go there to live! I reccomend to you,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GianGian00
30,Redondo Pier > Santa Monica Pier,"The Pier is OK. Not amazing, not terribly bad. There are many places worth visiting in LA - not this one. Go to Redondo Beach Pier instead. The beach next to it is dirty though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flyer485173
40,Iconic and beautiful,"Sunset at the beach alongside the pier is a beautiful experience, seagulls and the fresh breeze, the high palm trees, the California vibe in all it's expression",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristina_s_photo
50,Fun!,"Beautiful place to visit with family or alone. Parking can be challenging, my recommendation is to park in one of the parking garages and walk to pier. Bring your cámara!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sanyramirez
40,"Outstanding pier,Where historic route 66 ends!!","My eyes opened so wide when I saw this pier.The long,wide,beach by the pier leaves you astonish.The Pacific ocean opens wide in its glory.Owesome place to visit with families and friends,Enjoy the rides and games at pacific park,while you are there.Worth visiting!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emberte2015
50,Amazing during sunset,"Lovely place, very friendly, clean, nice breeze, full of lights after sunset, childlike fun, nice pictures can be taken as well. Must see visiting California. Cool atmosphere!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gotsaoligova
40,Good vibe,Lots going on here. A really energetic place where you can hire bikes and ride down the beach path to Venice beach. A great day out,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hscott26
40,Enjoyed this place!,"Lots of fun to be had here, our teenagers enjoyed the attractions on the pier, (my wallet didn't!). The amenities are well kept and the shops provide everything you need for a day at the nearby beach. Definitely recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gurinderd2013
40,Touristy but fun,"Definitely a tourist trap, but then again, if you are here at the right time, the view can be stunning and magical. Parking is another story all together.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/semanticvision
50,Amazing must see beach,I think the ferris wheel on this beach is a must do. Very busy beach and it was busy at night time as well. We ate at Albright restaurant and the food is great and fresh!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/154AndreS
50,Something for everyone here!,"Whether you like to shop, see nature- Aquarium, listen to music, go on rides in the fair, go fishing, go for a stroll, see and sit close to the ocean - it's all here waiting for you. If you go in the night you'll see it all lit up... Various places to park at the pier or close by- perhaps see that on-line",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shoshanah546
40,Worth a visit if you're there,"Certainly if you're going to Santa Monica beach you should checkout the pier.There are some rides & stalls which are fun for a walk around, and fortunately the cafes around Santa Monica are within walking distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mikeyde1989
40,Tourists everywhere,"Been there done that, seen it bought the T-shirt. Parking can be problematic, but accessible. Lots of buskers and entertainment (Ferris wheel, roller coaster ect). If in Santa Monica visit it once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SGC6368
50,Santa Monica Pier,The place is very busy and beautiful at night. The parking is terrible and you can spend a huge amount of time looking for a parking place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shirljennings
50,"Fantastic, memorable day","We love the pier. We bought day tickets and they proved great value for money. We spent most of the day there, headed in to Santa Monica for dinner, then continued the fun in the evening until late. Its a great atmosphere, fantastic setting and a real fun day out",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TJB333333
20,Needs a bath,It's a shame that this place can't get cleaned up. Amazing potential to be a family destination but it's full of derelicts and is so filthy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josephb931
30,Been there done that,Overpriced chain food and crowds of tourists. Everytime we come here it's hazy and the waters choppy but great place to people watch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleyerin2019
50,Pier rides,"Perhaps mark train was correct whe he offered ""take a long walk along a short pier""There are some great restaurants and fun things to do on Santa Monica pier. But the rides at palisades amusement park are the reason most people come to the pier. When my boys were three years old -- I bought them annual passses and took them to the pier every day for a year. They really loved it. I only wish it opened earlier. 11am is too late for a family with young kids that get up at 5:30am.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edwardv819
50,Great place to spend the day,"The Pier provides everything to make it the perfect spot to enjoy the day. The beach is beautiful to just sit and relax or swim. The pier is loaded with entertainment for all ages. Kids have an amusement ride area, plenty of shopping and great local entertainment for adults from musicians to artisians and even psychics. The mexican restaurant at the end of the pier is great for dinner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ALMAR1988
20,Disappointing Beach,"We spent the afternoon at the pier and beach. While the pier was OK, the beach was disappointingly dirty with broken glass on it!Within a stone's throw from the pier you would not expect that level of unsafe filth.That said, the shopping mall area is very classy and well appointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Notmicaela
50,Stroll on the beach..,We spent three hours on the beach and the kids had a lot of fun playing in the water. Lots of seagulls on the beach and it is fun to see the kids trying to chase them away. Lots of people on the beach and plenty of public parking is available. You do not have to pay parking fees after 7PM local time. Kids will like the Coaster ride on the pier!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/222sridhart
40,"Fun for all, but crowded.","Every single day is a good day to visit the pier. Parking is tough and traffic around there is busy but you can easily overcome that. Park at the 3rd street Promenade and walk over, take the new Metro Expo line from anywhere east of Santa Monica or take the Blue Bus.The pier has an amusement park that is fun for all ages and has a nice selection of rides for young kids. The arcade is perfect for teens. Fast Food is plentiful but there is a shortage of places to sit and eat. You're better off walking out to the food trucks and sitting on the lawn on Ocean Ave and enjoying the view.We take all our out of town guests here. Early mornings are less busy (pier opens at 10am). Evenings are packed.Take a jacket for the evenings.Take a hat or sum protection for a day time visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MoShoEli
40,Iconic pier in Cali,"Great place to go for a walk and feel the ocean. It can get very very crowded on summer months so it won't be that great relax time at the beach, but you get to see a lot of people and performers around so.. you can still have a good time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travellistics
30,Do it to say you've done it,"The rides are about $9 each, but they're not good enough to buy a wristband so.... If you have the family, pick one, cough up your $50 and be done with it. Typical pier-fare; trinkets, funnel cakes, musicians, and people. Lots and lots of people. Tough to find parking if you get there after noon. ALso traffic is awful in the afternoon and evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andreacE2184HK
40,Great beach,"We spent a couple of hours on the beach, the sand is sooo soft! The kids loved being in the water and the fairground kept thementertained for a while.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/220ronc
40,Cool place to while away a couple of hours...,"Iconic Californian location. The start, or finish (depending on your perspective) of the historic Route 66.Plenty of activity from street performers to religious zealots spreading the word. Choice of tourist attractions and places to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phil223
30,Average,"Standard pier, probably good for small kids due to rides. Great for a photo from the beach but that's about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisJames204
30,Iconic but too busy and cheesy,"Maybe I was expecting something better, especially because I had been at Disneyland the day before. I just felt it was cheap and cheesy. We did go on a Saturday, so I figured it would be crowded.I am glad that we went because it is an iconic place and I had wanted to see it. Palisades Park was nice, and we walked along 3rd St Promenade as well.I recommend stopping simply because it is so well-known!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TDPGH
30,Worth a look,"Not hugely different to a lot of seaside piers around the world. More hawkers maybe but the food, rides etc are pretty standard. Worth a visit but nothing special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/360emmas
50,Buzzing,"Spent a couple of hours here and enjoyed the buzz. There are a few buskers singing their songs which added to the atmosphere. The rides were typical fun fair style. Only did the mini rollercoaster (actually better than Harry Potter's flight of the hippogriff at Universal, and it's longer without the 60 min wait, here it's 5 mins!) and the swinging boat and both were fun.Good snack choices too. Gets super busy at night, which I believe creates the happy ambience all round.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/princepatel2016
50,Great options but very very busy!!!,Weekends are mobbed but lots of fun to be had here! Rides for little ones and the bigger ones and lots of food and sweet options. We are waiting for a quieter day !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Essextravellots
40,Santa Monica Pier review,"Yes, its fun. The rides are pretty cool. There is a roller coaster and a ferris wheel and some arcades and carnival type themes. There is also a Bubba Gump restaurant and of course the beach steps away.The characters at night are a little shady at the park around the entrance but their is a good police presence at all times. Parking is also available on the pier.It gets very crowded weekends and summers",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ResQDoc
40,Connected,This is a fun place with lots of food options and walkable. It is an amusement park and is so colorful at night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharDenver
40,Iconic and fun,This is a great place to stop by with the kids. Awesome views out to Venice beach. For the adults the Ferris wheel is a bucket list item we loved it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/venochik
40,A classic beach scene,Love the pier! There are more attractions today - including the ferris wheel which gives you a full view of the SM Bay. Very fun evening for our family!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mismel2kl
40,Great Views,"It was a busy evening but fun nonetheless. Some odd characters can be found there doing odd things for money. But, it's fun in its own way and the views are great. I wouldn't pay to eat there but it's an experience if you're into that. We walked from there to the other end o Venice boardwalk and it was a great walk!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gonz3160
40,Enjoyable afternoon,"My dad and I walked along the pedestrian path in between he bike path and beach taking in the sights to the pier. We didn't do any of the carnival rides, but did enjoy live music on the pier and watching all the athletic men and women show off their strength at muscle beach. It was a pleasant way to spend an afternoon. Our only regret was not renting bikes to ride along the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vtaylo2888
30,On the way to LAX,"Stopped at the pier while on the way to LAX for last minute fun, before taking my 3 Grandaughters to LAX to fly home. It was fun, but alittle expensive for the rides. $8.50 per ride or $17.50 for a all day pass, if you have the time to spend. The arcade was definitely a hit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shortdlee
30,Day trip,Visited this on a day trip during our travels. A bit disappointed with pier as only contained a few tacky shops and some restaurants. There was a fun fair so if you have young children they may enjoy it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suek447
40,little fairground,"Loved this quaint fairground, My daughter and husband got the wristbands for unlimited rides and had a great time, lots of food outlets there too",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kidsintow_placestogo
40,Never disappoints..,After visiting on business I knew I had to bring the family next time I came back to LA. We arrived late afternoon when the place was buzzing with atmosphere. And just headed to the end of the boardwalk to sit and watch the street performers and stare out to sea.. you know you are then on holiday...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/709kirstiel
40,Still a classic spot to visit,"The whole area just brings a smile to the face. Do you see homeless people? Yes. But admit to yourself, if you were homeless, this is where you want to be.. Great views of the ocean, quirky merchandise, sun was shining, it was a great spot to spend some time.. Classic Americana.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crazistevoh
40,A place like no other!,"Cool place with lots to see and do! Isn't free from the shadyness that surrounds the area though, and walking to our hotel afterwards felt pretty unsafe, even at fairly early hours.Liked the arcade, the rollercoaster and the view from the tip of the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UncouthL
50,Lively and inviting,A great place for strolling around and people watching. Music and shops and entertainment all day. We enjoyed spending the day here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sunjo100
50,Lovely Pier,"Visited twice once at night and once on a lovely sunny day. At night is great when all the rides are lit up and also it's a bit cooler however I'd say its more busy at night than in the day. There's restaurants, fast food places, sweet stalls and other little stands. People fish at the end of the pier and if you're lucky you will see a heron or two sitting perched on the side. Nice place to spend an hour or two although if you go too early most places wont be open.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seanoldinho
40,Amazing views from the Pier,"Our family spent 8 days and 7 nights visiting the greater LA area and the Santa Monica Pier was one of the first stops. While most of the pier was . . . pretty disappointing, the END of the pier - with those views of the sunset - are worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joelp518
40,Ok,This is a nice place to spend a few hours at. Nice atmosphere with amusements and vendors. It's similar to coney Island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TREK39
50,A Perfect Place to go for a vacation.,"If you decide to take a trip to LA, you have to take the time to drive to Santa Monica and go to the Santa Monica Pier. There is something for everyone - young/ old and young at heart. Great views, arcade for kids and teens, different kinds of food, a merry go round, beach, playground and you can go fishing too. They have everything. You can spend at least half a day here. Make sure you try the Japadog - Japanese style hot dog. Celebrity chefs like Giada and Anthony Bourdain have tried them. Parking is not a problem. Public parking costs $17.95 for the day and it's free for the first 90 mins. Don't forget the bathing suits -- you won't be able to resist the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pejenn
50,Lots of Fun for Everyone,"Everything is great, ice cream! View of the Pacific! Rides for children! and Shrimp Galore!Exotic drinks. One of the best beaches in the country. But there are plenty of people!It is very pretty. One of the less costly activities in pricey Santa Monica!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I1514PKmarke
50,Beautiful,What a beautiful happy place this pier is. A very chilled walk along where you could listen to the street singers or just get lost in your own little world. Lots of street side eateries on the way down and back up the other side. Just a really nice place to be at.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharonBoon1
50,Amazing,It was my first time going to be a beach and this place was a wonder! So pretty and just amazing. I had a great time there ☺️,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sonap352
50,End of Route 66,"Santa Monica is so busy, and the Pier is the centre of everything that happens. You have got restaurants, bars, gift shops, arcades, stalls, line music, amusement parks al in the one place as well as the stunning beach views and at sunset the views out towards Malibu from here are unbelievable.Everything is expensive on the Pier and you can eat, drink and make merry up in the town long into the night.Ton Hanks sprung to mind on a couple of occasions as Zoltar (from Big) is still there and this is where Forrest Gump turns around after running across America!Went down a few times to the Pier so loved the busyness and the bussle of it all.You don't need to walk down the ramp to get to it, it is accessible from the beach path but the view you have in front of you as you go down from the promenade is amazing, especially at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andhewittscores
10,Very disappointing dirty location,"With 10 hours spare in LA we took a taxi to Santa Monica, OMG this place is terrible, a Sea Front town that has a terrible homeless issue. The Pier its self was dirty and needed modernizing, the rides do not open until 10am, the public toilet are the worste I have seen, excrement and paper every where, and a general smell of urine in locations.If you have spare time do not visit this location. Wish we had just stayed in the airport",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H3702DBandrewh
40,Great day of fun!,Santa Monica Pier is such a treat. It's location is second to none in California and it provide a great day of fun making you feel like a kid again. The rides are fun for the little ones and the area has the feel of an old style carnival. The food is what you would expect in this setting and the Pier is landmark that must be visited.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FlaviaL924
50,Beautiful Place,"Great place to visit. Tons of shopping, great restaurants, good viewpoint for photos of the beach and mountains, amusement park. Also, a great farmers market. We stayed in Hollywood, but wished we had stayed in Santa Monica instead. It is definitely worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hn1972
40,Looking for the land of movies 🎥,"A typical place where all has been touched by a camera. You see the movies eating your path and dizzily catching you in as a star for a day. For families, couples, alone walkers, fans, old child, sneakers, speakers, slickers, sinkers, smothered, s people in this case. S=Starz of the daily life. U got it?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/194gianlucav
40,beautiful sunny california beach,"beautiful views, nice eateries though a bit crowded, nice view of the sunset, couple of rides that you can try( i didn't) fishing here is quite good if you want a good catch",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GauravK2067
50,Must visit if you are in LA,"Food, fun, and the ocean! I love this place! I've been here multiple times and always enjoy walking around the shops and restaurants. Parking below the pier is $12 and only accepts cash so come prepared.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/405christis
30,Very cute,"I only come here for guests, but I think it is a good staple for guest itinerary. It'd really be 3 1/2 stars for the delight santa monica pier gives movie lovers. Kids seem to love the rides and junk food :) Parking looked a mess, so we walked.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FakeBananaFlavor
40,Iconic fun in Santa Monica!,"The pier is a must visit when in the Santa Monica area. There are places to grab a bite to eat, there's Pacific Park amusement park, and there are a number of tours that leave from here for various things like stars homes, downtown LA, etc.Pacific park was fun, but would be better suited for younger kids (say 10yo or less). My 14 yo teens were only interested in three rides, the West Coaster, Pacific (Ferris) Wheel and the Sea Dragon. There are the usual carnival games, popcorn/candy carts, etc. It's not an all day park, maybe only a couple hours if that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chucks-World
30,It was... OK,"So this place only gets an average rating from me... I know its a iconic landmark, but seriously... its way better in the movies.Granted, when I visited it was packed with people and thats a negative for me regardless of the location...but expensive parking, overpriced food, condescending street preachers, and people peddling various unneeded wares didn't add to the experience. The beach was grossly overcrowded.Is it worth a visit? Yes... but make sure to do it during the non peak season or during a weekday. If you're going for the beach, there are probably nicer options in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jastein
40,Fun Thursday night,There were big crowds and a concert on the beach but the pier was big enough for everyone to find something to enjoy. Beautiful sunset and a slight chill in the air made it worth fighting the crowds. Great people watching too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stlouismomma
50,Beautiful,"One of my favorite places in the country, make sure to walk to the end of it and enjoy the most beautiful sunsets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julianac238
40,Family fun!,"Great fun with our two 8 year olds, surprisingly clean and lines weren't too bad. I'd avoid on a weekend as it is super busy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sophjasp
50,Please go,Gods it's awesome there. The vibe the atmosphere the people.We did it as part of a tour and loved it so much we went back twice.Watch the live shows. They are free but make sure to give Love where it's deserved.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnieS2May
30,Worth walking along,I've been to the pier a few times and the most recent was one of the busiest due to it being summer. It's a pleasant walk if you park further down the beach and walk up. The amusement rides are fun but nothing special. There are a few restaurants along the pier but nothing I would call 5 star.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OMurphyUK
40,Good for a walk,"Lots of action, a good viewpoint for photos of the beach and mountains. Amusement park and food options.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisa4864
40,Sould visit in the evening,A very romantic place to visit in the evening. There's a really cool atmosphere. It's worth getting on a huge wheel (although it's not very high) but it's still fun,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ADaminko
30,Worth a visit,"Parked at Santa Monica beach and walked passed Muscle Beach to the pier, nice little walk and got to see the pier from a distance and up close. There is a fairground on the pier but we didn't visit it so can't comment. When we came back to the car it was 10:30pm and the pier was brightly lite up against the night sky, did look quite extraordinary.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amy2587

50,Chill night with friends,"Sea breeze, fried food, rides pop corn on a summer night. All good . Love coming here. There's something for everyone",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/885gayanp
50,must see,"the pier is definitely a to do in LA... its a blast.. interesting people doing stuff on beach and the pier has a amusement park.. its touristy but on weekends lots of locals go there too.. bext lunch place and value is ""Albrights"" right on the pier... expect tonpay for parking but oblt runs about $10-$15 for all day and then walk several blocks up street ftom pier and enjoy the promenade area in Santa Monica. Rent a bike for $20 and cycle a few minutes to Venice beach area which truly can be a spectacle... there is too much to see in LA but if you only have a few days.. these areas will make the trip for you",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnC13215
40,Average,Didn't take any photos as was not impressed by the place .. the beach was full of homeless people .. lot of dirt on the beach and considering the drive from LA not sure i will come to to Santa Monica as its a very average place with a Pier,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NaomiUSA
40,Great Views,"Its a nice walk down Santa Monica Pier lots of people though. We stopped off at the amusement park. Save you money. Everything seems a bit tired and cheesey, but I think it is more suited to the little kids rather than the big kids. Right down the end of the pier there were loads of fisherman all throwing a line in. It was great to watch because there was a few seals waiting for the catch to come up. Great views from all directions a must do when in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoH852
40,Fun in the sand,Went here to try sightsee and try the beach..kids had fun.. lots of food and shopping options if you're not prepared..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mcpmedin
40,Good pier with lots of activities and restaurants,Really enjoyed our walk along the pier. Proper old fashioned entertainment. Loved looking at the old carousel and also the roller coaster and big wheel although didn't go on any of them.Several choices of restaurarants and generally a really good ambience. Great views aping the beach in both directions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/434davidj
40,Must see,"It's classic. Great opportunities for pictures. Always a nice breeze. Little crowded during peak season, but worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joshuar93
40,"Crowded, Hot, but a great view","We were here on a weekend in August, so it was roasting hot and absolutely full of people. It is well worth getting out to the end of the pier, though, where you'll find great views of the Pacific Ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dsjump
30,Way way way too busy,There were so many people it was unbelievable..... I did not care for that but it was nice to quickly walk down to the shore and back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mzzshawny

50,Romantic nights...,Got a chance to spend the night with a special Friend and this action packed pier made everything wonderful...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PenniesEarned
40,Legendary pier but tired,"The wood planks are all over the place, a litigators heaven. This place is generally a little tired and could use some TLC.It's glory days are long gone, I hope it get some much needed attention soon. Still very much iconic, right next to Hotel California and greatly illuminated at night.The rides are expensive for what they are. The up side was the indoor carousel right by the start of the pier and also Soda Jerks for the Ice Creams, also right next to the carousel.We ate at Bubba Gumps on the pier and that wasn't great either. I don't like to give negative reviews but that's what it is im afraid.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christianrU3803US
50,Fun / lots to do,"Amusement rides , funnel cakes and souvenir shopping. A nice place ... after waking thru Venice beach ..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/momof3kidsToronto
30,Iconic pier but very bisy,We visited on a Saturday and it was absolutely packed. There are some good street entertainers and it's great for Pokémon but it is extremely busy. We walked on to the beach for a quick paddle and I have never seen so many people on a beach in all my travels. Worth a quick visit and then head up the coast to a quieter spot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amanda4471
50,"Santa Monica pier for food, beach, entertainment and Pokémon go","You can take the train to Santa Monica. The pier is 2 blocks from the train station. The pier has a rollercoaster and arcade for kids. Restaurants, Food vendor, beach vendors who draws your picture and artist that spells your name in colorful pictures.Lots of Pokémon to catch. You can catch quite a bit here just walking up and down the pier. The network connection at the end of the pier is not great.Many poke stops to reload balls .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fmw16169
50,Yeah nice,It's really lovely place if you wanna play you can go there of you don't wanna play there's also a place to go even when you see the sunset 🌅Clean place and the sea over there is so beautiful 😍Also there some pikes you can take at least 1 hour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/986nouraa
40,Worth a visit,Was a fun afternoon trip after a morning on the beach.Rides are fun but small and a few are charged extra but not too many. We used the go la card so had free entry ... worth the visit especially if using the go la card,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stuartw491
30,Pretty good beach,"Pros - Perfect blue sky. Lovely ocean water. Plenty of fit bodies and cute kids running around. Video arcade, amusement park, merry-go-round, and big Ferris wheel made our children very happy. And the beach is literally right there.Cons - Pricey unhealthy touristy beach food. Also, it was very crowded on the day we went. If you want to feel sand under your toes, just walk 10 minutes in either direction away from the pier and the crowd thins out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andrew_L_008
50,One of the best,The Pier has several eating establishments including restaurants. It has it's own Amusement Park. It has plenty of stalls and many buskers to watch/listen to. It has seating all along the sides so you can relax and enjoy the view. Very popular place. We went there every day of our trip. It's a must do in Santa Monica.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PFTraveller62
50,A must !,"We got there at 7pm and it was perfect, You can walk in the pier, enjoy the view have dinner and enjoy the rides. I recommend to purchase the unlimited ride ticket as is more convenient. They have a section for kids under 42"". They have a couple of restaurants at the beginning but they also have food stands and an comunal area to sit down and eat. We saw a lot of people at the beach when we were leaving.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gabrielagG4924LY
40,Busy busy busy 👌,"It's a good place to come on a summer time , but it's busy , just come early and you can enjoy the amazing veiw 🇺🇸",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V7927IWdavidl
40,A Great End To The Day,"We visited the Santa Monica pier after a day of walking around Hollywood and it was a nice end to the day. The sunset was beautiful and the area was lively. They had some sort of twilight concert going on as well. It was nice to hear some of the buskers as you walk along and see people just having fun dancing. You can venture into the frigid waters and there is an area to rinse off afterward. I liked that they had a boardwalk for those who done care for getting sand in their shoes. After stopping at the pier, there are numerous spots to eat in the immediate area. I found Santa Monica to be a far more enjoyable place than LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thomwayn
50,Expensive but if you have GO LA card then it is included,My kids 12 and 14 really liked the rides on the pier but the tickets are high around $34. If you have the Go LA card then you don't have to pay since it is included. Bubba Gump is pretty good place to eat but if you wait too long it can be a wait to get a table.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/easygo
50,Crowded but Fun California Beach,"We were here on a Saturday and it was very crowded but we were able to eat at a restaurant on the pier with less than a 30 minute wait, let the kids ride a few rides at Paradise Park, and dip our toes in the Pacific Ocean. The beach was packed to say the least. Not many places you have the beach, shops, street performers, restaurants, amusement park rides, volleyball, fitness performers, gymnastic rings etc etc all in one location. Beautiful scenery and top attraction but go on the weekend in the summer and don't be surprised at the crowds. One of the favorite things my family enjoyed was watching the fitness buffs do their strength displays in the Muscle beach area. Very entertaining!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MyHumbleOpinion
30,Enjoyable Stroll,Had an enjoyable stroll down a packed Santa Monica Pier on a Friday night before heading off to dinner.The imagery and references to the Santa Monica pier and area in popular songs and tv / movie culture is hard not to know so being here to see it for myself was amazing.Finding parking when arriving proved very challenging and it was a little too busy for my preferences however it was overall a good experience.A recommended must do when in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rod102au
30,iconic place to visit,We visited Santa Monica Pier twice during our recent visit to LA. It doesn't appear as crowded during the daytime. Plenty of seating areas to relax and watch the world go by. Take a picture by the iconic Route 66 sign. Place really comes alive at night-time. Worth the visit even if its only to say you have been there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Raheny11
50,Must see,"Beautiful place, the ride in Ferriswheel was awesome. It gives you a view of the ocean and beach. Very cool pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/559amaliak
50,Great,"Beautiful to visit on a nice day. There are vendors, artists and rides. Fabulous views. There are great restaurants nearby, such as the Lobster.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexH214
50,MUST GO,"Parking right next to it and not a long walk up and down the pier restaurants on the pier and fair not to expensive. Little stalls and music players filled the pier. It was also near the shopping mall and an inside carousel place which does amazing ice cream, drinks and desserts. Obviously near the beach and ideal place for picture taking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmelieRule
50,Fun scene,"The Pier offered amusement rides in addition to the visible ferris wheel. There are a number of restaurants with music. One on the outer end of the Pier. Plus smaller food & ice cream stands. Souvenir shopping of course. But also artists doing portraits, cartoonists and even two gentlemen sculpting faces in clay for sitting patrons. Street performers entertaining. Its a pier so there are people fishing from the far end. Caution, I did see signs saying don't eat the fish caught from this point on the pier. A seal in the water was entertaining people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MIke23693
40,Exploring Santa Monica Pier and 3rd Street Promenade,"We all enjoyed our experience in this area with the pier, shops, restaurants and people watching. It is worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/431jinc
40,Iconic place to visit and worth spending the day there,Santa Monica is very iconic and I'm glad we visited. I had an LA Go Pass which included the rides on the pier. Great day out and worth renting a bike to head over to Venice beach. Enjoy sunbathing or walking around. I even liked the lifeguard huts/towers more than the other beaches I visited. I recommend looking up parking lots before heading over. One place up the street from Santa Monica Pier was wanting to charge $30 for the day. I googled and found one between venice beach and santa Monica pier right by the beach for $8 for the whole day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drifting_nomad
50,End of the line on Route 66,"We really did enjoy Santa Monica and were so fortunate to be staying a very short distance away on 2nd Street / Broadway. This was an ideal location to explore Santa Monica on foot and we were there for 4 days, a large part of the time spent on the pier.Yes the weather was brilliant, clear blue skies and high summer temperatures in late June and the crowds were large.There is entertainment for all and the exercise is good for everyone. We spent a lot of time at the end of the pier watching the fishermen cast their lines and land their catch. There is Pacific Park with the iconic Ferris Wheel, plenty of shops and bars and street entertainers.Note you get good views across to Malibu and south to Venice Beach.This is just such fun place to hang out which made for a very relaxing few days after driving the entire length of Route 66 from Chicago, Il, officially 2,448 miles which we added a few more on our many side trips off the Mother Road.Would readily recommend this attraction to anyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MartinG476
50,"Reminds me of Blackpool, only nicer!",A great place to visit on a sunny day. Lots of souvenir stalls and places to eat. Amazing views of the Pacific Ocean and Santa Monica beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelenBezzo
50,"Fun , nostalgic time for every one","Spent the weekend in Santa Monica and had to go to the pier.There are a lot of rides similar to those boardwalk amusement piers along the Jersey Shore.Ferris wheel is all solar powered and is 90' high.Roller coaster and that old pirate ship that swings are among the adult rides we did.Bracelets for adults run $32.50 and $17.50 for kids for unlimited rides. or $8 per ride. It's worth the bracelet.There are also numerous restaurants, arcade games, carnival games and your great variety of odd balls all over the pier.Parking is available on the pier but costs a mint and you can only come and go at certain times.The aquarium which I did not go to is on the beach level.A must do in Santa Monica",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Koyote1
40,"Such a fun, iconic spot!","Sunny, interesting, great people-watching spot. It just screams southern California! If you get there early parking is easy and abundant - even on a nice day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ingridvjones
50,Great views and fun for kifs,This is an amazing place for the kids. Not only is the view spectacular but it offers shopping and rides for the kids. Definitely worth the trip to Santa Monica Pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/890rajad
10,Waste of time,Walked the pier prior to opening and decided to hang out in the ocean ... pier didn't have much of anything on it for the price of all day bands.. Santa Cruz puts this boardwalk to shame,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chantayw2017
50,Really American,"I really like this place cause it is typically American. Food, attractions, games, shops and Road 66. Dont't miss the sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/157gw_na_lb
20,SO MANY PEOPLE,We walked down to the pier from our hotel - walked to the end - turned around and walked back. Did not do any if the rides. Touristy stands and shops are spread throughout along with musicians and such peddling their trade. There is a park near the top of the pier that was overrun with homeless folks. Sad to see. I can say I did it but will probably not go back. There are free concerts there on Thursdays nights in the summer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RRC72
50,Had a blast,The kids loved the rides. Bought the wrist bands. As long as you go on more than 5 rides it's worth it. Fun afternoon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scm77
50,Beautiful sunset,Great place to visit for a view of a beautiful sunset.Also lots of places to eat or grab a drink. Very clean and tidy too,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bettyp22
50,Great view.,Seems this is a must do. You're over the water. We walked all the way to the end of the pier and while there a giant seal came up and we took pictures before it slipped back under and left. He was looking for handout from the fisherman fishing off the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lizardia
30,Everybody gets there so prepare for heavy crowds and crazy traffic,"This is the most visited spot in the SM City I would say. Decent breeze, noisy! But just within 15 minutes walk it gets less packed. If you want to have lunch (seafood) be there early and reserve table, sometimes one hour waiting should be expected. Make sure you try CHURROS ($ 2 for one, $ 5 for three) from latina women that sell this 'mexican donut' along the walking way towards the pier, delicious! Coffe, restaurants and fastfood are available. Free restrooms. Amusement park. Beach access with shower. Parking nearby (it's huge). I keep coming back, the air by the ocean feels much better than in DTLA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcins90
20,Underwhelming,"This is simply just a pier. Nothing special about it, just exceptionally busy. The beaches either side are just beaches...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0908267

40,Nice with family,"Nice to visit with family there is many games for the kidsTry the shrimps restaurantBut not the place for swimming , better to go down to Venice beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aranaji
50,Sun & fun with options,I think it is a must see place. Lots for kids and family with rides & beach. The walk along the beach to many dining options is a plus. Plenty of parking if you are in a car. Hotel options are also really good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GymBeau12

10,Yikes,"I really don't recommend. This pier is filled with homeless and smells like piss. Also, what really freaked me out was that this guy was just lying on the ground because he just got stabbed. I only saw this once, but it wouldn't surprise me if it happened again. After that, I really didn't feel safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K5829XWamandat

40,Nice place to chill out,"The pier is a nice place to just relax and take in the sea breeze. It's a nice place in the morning and late evening when the crowds are thinner. Decent food choices available when you get hungry. It is a very touristy place so prices do reflect that. A nice thing to do is to get an ice cream, take a seat at the end of the pier and watch the fishermen reel in their catch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sailaway75

50,A journey back in time. Fun for kids and younger teens.,"We had our grandkids (ages boy 12 and girl 15) with us for a day visit to the pier. We bought them day-passes so they could go on almost all the rides as much as they wanted. You can also pay for separate rides as well. There was one ride, for two-people and it swings them around upside-down - they had to pay 5 dollars a piece for - they paid this themselves and they thought it was worth the price and did it twice (this was the only ride not includes in their day-pass. There are lots of fast-food restaurants and games as well. I was glad they could experience an old-fashioned American carnival place. It was nice to walk around the pier as well. Great views - take the ferris-wheel for wonderful views. The kids enjoyed it. We liked watching them have fun! This was a journal back in time for me as I had ben here as a child. It is also used in many films and TV programs. (My entire family misses P.O.P. (Pacific Ocean Park) Which was near here in the 1960s! Sad I could not share that with them as well.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyNorwegians
20,"Very busy, but worth a visit if only to mark off your bucket list","We visited as a family of 7 in July 2017. It was a place I had always wanted to visit and there were some parts that were great like the beautiful vintage carousel and the pier itself. Unfortunately the pier is way too over crowded to really enjoy, and the public restrooms are sadly lacking for the amount of users.The restrooms just off the pier were in such a poor state of cleanliness my daughter ( who was in dire need of a restroom) refused to use them. We were so looking forward to spending time at this world famous location, but left a little deflated by our experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peewee1010

50,Coney Island of the Pacific,"Santa Monica Pier is a great American landmark, and with its famed arched neon entryway and amusement park jutting out into the Pacific, it's supremely picturesque as well. The pier marks the end of the famed Route 66, the Santa Monica beach on either side, an aquarium beneath, many shops, and food offerings,and the beautiful Pacific Park. The park is a small amusement park with a great couple of rides, and games but nothing to rival the much larger Coney Island or any theme park, but a wonderful slice of Americana none the less.Enjoy it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YoYoBumchuck
30,Cool to see but...,"This is a historic landmark and it was cool to see as it offers amazing views of the ocean and mountains. Other than the amusement rides, there's not much here. The shops just offer tourist gear, no boutiques or specialty shops. The ""entertainment"" on the pier is in some cases not quite suitable for kids. Other than the view, not really a great atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yerblues68

20,Too crowded,If you walk to this pier be prepared to be engulfed in a human wave of people from start to finish. It was not fun or interesting at all.

Lots of people trying to get you to part with your money.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pineguy

50,Uniquely Santa Monica,This is a must stop place in Los Angeles and the specially Santa Monica! This is Storico location offers incredible views of the beach and some of the coolest world-class sunset views you'll ever see. Stroll to the end of the Pier and enjoy drinks and lunch or dinner there. The restaurants are wonderful. You can also buy walking food on the pier. A trip to the pier would not be complete without a visit to Pacific Park which includes roller coasters and other amusement rides and games.

30,Iconic Views and Place,"This is an iconic place but not overwhelmingly special. Carnival type rides and games, and a few places to eat. The Mexican restaurant on the pier is only so-so. Offers great views of the coastline and is beautiful, and crowded, towards sundown. It's an urban attraction so be watchful of pick-pockets or people who've just had a few too many, while you enjoy. It can get cool along the coast even in the summer, so keep that in mind as you dress. The Metro Expo line station is just a few blocks away, and there are plenty of other restaurants near the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RealDoubleM

It was fun for my kids but probably not something we want to do again. There were several homeless people asking for money, religious persons preaching (hari-Krishna), food was super expensive (dipping dots was $7.00 for a small cup and 7.50 for a larger cup). So...overall it's a rip-off and we all know it but we do it ! :(We mostly were just playing games while waiting for our reservation at the Bubba Gump restaurant (another review)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Combatfisher

The pier is over 100 years old and houses the family amusement park called Pacific Park. The pier that stands today is actually two adjoining piers with the original long narrow pier opening on September 9, 1909. The second and wider pier to the south, known as the Pleasure Pier or the Newcomb Pier was built in 1916 for the purpose of housing an amusement center.

30,Compared to Santa Barbara Wharf... meh,"It lacks upper class food, quality views, peace. If your all about screaming kids running around and vendors that resemble a fair than here’s your pier.

However, that's when we happened to be there and the beach was so crowded, there wasn't enough room to put down 2 towels next to each other without overlapping with someone else's towels or ""area"", and we walked from the pier up the beach about half a mile searching for a spot. Our kids were trying to jump waves and were consistently pushed over by the tons of people also trying to jump waves.

It's crowded, it's touristy ... but it's still a fun little spot to check out. $7/ticket for the rides which seemed reasonable as you get multiple turns on the ticket; two consecutive rides on the roller coaster and I think we went around 4+ times on the Ferris wheel which had nice views including watching a pod of dolphins travel slightly off shore. Kids enjoyed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coreye799
50,When People Talk About the Good Old Times,"The Santa Monica Pier is not just for tourists. I have lived close by for over 60 years, and I never tire of it. This weekend, I took a 9 year old granddaughter and her 3 year old cousin. We had a ball. After the Ferris wheel, the view from which is a spectacular aerial shot of the Santa Monica beaches north and south, thronged with bathers, we selected one ride for the older child followed by one for the younger. (Height separates them as to eligibility to get on rides.) In all, we enjoyed perhaps six different rides, steering away from the carny attractions that make throwing a ring around a bottleneck look easy.Both kids were excited, with no let up. I, on the other hand, refused to join in the whirling seat that looked so vomitous or the human centrifuge, which was vomitous. My granddaughter laughed her way through both rides, despite a corn dog. The kids rides were a bit too small for ole granddad, so the two youngsters sat in a tiny airplane or boat and went round.A note on the corn dog: it was good. So was my turkey club sandwich. That's amazing given madness all around as seemingly thousands walk up and down that pier on our beautiful weekends. Eat there! You will be surprised.Then go on the merry go round. That is truly a whirl back in time. There's a Wurlitzer to boot. If you want something that requires more than sitting on a wooden horse, rent a bike next door and ride down to the Venice pier and back. And stop along the way and just people watch or shop. It is a unique hour, and righteous exercise!Note: take a bike lock to be sure your bike is there after you stop and look at Musclemen or shop for trinkets. We saw what looked like a live snake held by a muscular bare chested man, but the young one, hauled in a little convertible trailer, fell asleep (probably just as well), and missed it. Not unusual.If you live in LA, be a regular. If you visit LA, it's a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/292richardr
50,Great family fun.,Great place to visit and see a few street performers. Loved the park rides and not excessive in pricing. Would definitely recommend the location for families visiting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/717RichardG
30,Too touristy!,"It's a nice view of the beach and the water. But don't bother. It's so touristy. It's loud and full of colorful hawkers and performers looking for tips. Not a pleasant beach experience. But if you want to check it off your ""done that"" list while in Cali then go for it! Very crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dshochet
30,A fun filled day that included a quick tour of the pier,We enjoyed our day touring the Pier and the local shops. I personally wouldn't spend a lot of time on the pier. It is busy and touristy but certainly a thing you should go see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cynthialouiser
30,Classic Pier,"If you enjoy playing Pokemon Go or your family likes small rides/arcades/average beaches you could easily fill a day here. There is a lot of neat history to the attractions here and no shortage of things to eat and buy. Despite the many homeless people around and huge crowds it feels pretty safe, partly because there is a police station on the pier. I think the pier is prettiest in the evening. The lights on the roller coaster and carousel are best appreciated at night, and sunset views here are gorgeous.I highly recommend the flavored sodas at the carousel house if you are here. Do not eat at these restaurants though, as they all serve mediocre food at a premium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hizzysimz
20,Slice of Humanity,"We walked to the Santa Monica Pier after walking through the Third Street Promenade. It is a fascinating place in a number of ways, but it really is an iconic place that has become a very crowded tourist spot. Many of the people on the shopping side the pier looked bored, but it is a popular selfie-taking spot (with the ferries wheel in the background). We did have a good funnel cake during our visit, and there are a number of restaurants on the pier that sport great views of the water and the shoreline. It was great for people watching. Overall, worth a brief visit, if only to say that you have been there. But also no need to plan to spend more than an hour or two at the pier, even if you plan to ride the carnival rides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jena669

50,Love this 1922 historic pier,"It's a great calif thing to doAnd it's been kept like a relic fromThe past. People, atmosphere And family fun - this place has it all and the beach is stunning - goes for miles. Santa Monica Pier puts you in a good mood. Heaps of food avail - although you may have toSearch for health food . Third street promenade is nearby - so you won't starve . Visit there after.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephtravelwriter
40,Very Touristic Spot. But a must.,We went there at 10 PM. It was not too busy. Nice rides and a lot of street artists. Especially musicians. Just great to be so close to the ocean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Viajanos

50,Nice Old School Pier,"Rides WAAAYYYY over priced, but atmosphere was fantastic. Definately try to go doe sunset. I tried, and clouds covered in last few minutes. :-(It's funny blindfolded me and put me there, I might guess I was not in the US. A lot of international people.A lot of street entertainers were decent",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dukester1985

30,Unique location and tourist destination,"Only place we've seen a pier with a Ferris wheel and roller-coaster but otherwise touristy with some shops, buskers and fresh air. A must-see if you're in the area but don't need much time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Crimitorii
40,Get Your Kicks at the End of Route 66,"This is a must visit if you are in Santa Monica. The Pier is an iconic symbol and is still super fun place to see. It stands as the symbolic end of old Route 66. On our visit it was a super hot day in California but the ocean breeze was nice and cool. Vendors set up along the pier, the midway, people fishing and people watching across the wide beach at Santa Monica. Parking can fill up quickly, we parked up the street and walked down to the pier. Fun for all to be had",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seashark7
50,Great pier!,Santa Monica Pier was great lots to do here and plenty eateries. The pier attracts a lot of attention and the beach is so busy. To park here you pay a one off fee and get to stay the whole day which is good if you arrive early and spend the day here. You wouldn't be bored here always lots to do & see. We had food and drinks in a restaurant on the end of the pier this was nice with the nice views as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Samantharhodes85
50,Family fun,"This place had beach, a variety of restaurants, grab and go food and a set of carnival rides.Very fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/696erikm

40,Nice,A packed place but worth the stop. Busy beach but plenty of it. Pier has amusement rides and tons of junky food and touristy stands. Fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeanneHA
40,Worth the visit,The Pier was busy and vibrant.Worth going down for a look.We hired a push bike and rode to Venice beach and back. Something I highly recommend you do. I hadn't ridden a bike in 10yrs.Do it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beached-Taco
50,"Great views, entertainment",The Santa Monica Pier affords some wonderful views. Licensed entertainers line the pier and there are games and carnival rides. Be sure to dine with a local restaurant if you choose to eat on the pier as there are a number of terrific choices.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarryV954
40,Old world fun,"Everything it was build up to be. An amusement park, shops and places to eat. Very busy but lovely views out to sea and of LA. Lots of pigeons!! Lots of things to do for all ages. We had a quick visit manly to see the end of Route 66. Beach wa so huge!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/narpa01
30,Too crowded,"Beautiful place, great view but beach is too crowded, as well as the pier.People eating by the beach and there were no garbage bins near the beach - huge miss from the local authorities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertaCar
50,Fun Day in the Sun,We really enjoyed seeing the pier with the Amusement Park and all the vendors. It's really clean and inviting. We ate at a small ice cream parlor and enjoyed it very much! All kinds of people to see if you like to people watch lolThe city of Santa Monica was fun to explore as well. Lots of high end shopping!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimgreenm2015
40,Active pier,Lots happening on the Santa Monica Pier. You can walk the pier in a few minutes or you can choose to spend the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3cntrygrls
50,Beautiful,We walked to it about 40 blocks. Not to crowded and a lot to see. We played on the beach and went into the ocean. Lots of rides and places to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travler0720
30,Nice athmosphere despite of the crowd,Santa Monica Pier is worth visiting as it is recognizable from many movies and tv-series. Santa Monica Pier and Beach have way too many tourists for our taste but amazingly the Pier does not give you the feeling of claustrophobia even though there is a small amusement park/funfair on it and we were there in the middle of July and in the middle of the day. The athmosphere is easy-going and jovial.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vuopalat
40,Busy place on the 4th.,"Certainly a busy place on the 4th of July. Lots of souvenir shops. arcade ( quarters, not tokens ),..and midway rides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdrianSly
30,Go for the end of Route 66 and the views not the food,"Always bustling and full of life but it's also a tourist trap heaven with lots of street artists and sub par restaurants with high prices. Come take photos, enjoy the views and then hit the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ant-across-the-world
20,Overrated and not much to do,"After doing research on the internet and talking to friends, visiting Santa Monica Pier was added to our itinerary for our first trip to California. We found parking a few blocks from the pier and walked to it. When we saw it from a distance, we were a little shocked of the small size, but decided we had to check it out anyway because so many people raved about it. The pier offered nice views of the beach/ocean and there were a few little shops and food vendors. However, it was pretty disappointing and we got bored very quickly. We are used to large amusement parks and boardwalks from the Jersey or Maryland beaches. I don't recommend that people go out of their way to visit this pier if on vacation to California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/115trishe
20,"Not clean, alcohol everywhere.","Maybe that's the style of party and drinking but we took our family there and it was very dirty, people drunk and over enjoying themselves. Not for us :(",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Evans1988
40,"Busy, but Free!","So we had to visit here at the end of our Vegas to LA road trip, taking in some of Route 66.Found parking easy a few blocks down.The pier is busy, but there seemed a nice atmosphere and the weather was lovely for just wandering.We stopped for burgers in the last burger bar on the pier and they were such good value and great tasting.A few fisherman and oddly a few bible preachers that was a little off putting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsACM
30,"Unique experience, but crowded and overrated","My two teenage boys and I added the pier to our ""must do"" list while visiting California. Needless to say, we don't need to ever do it again. It was nice to see, but we aren't sure why it is so popular. The beach looked like all of the others and we are used to large amusement parks in Ohio, so the rides weren't worth the long lines. There were several local musicians that were nice to listen to and local vendor wagons, but nothing worth trying to find parking or fighting the crowd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tylerandgunnar
50,"Great pier, would like to return.","I visited here during the week on a tour from Vegas and stayed a few hours. Seen the welcome to Santa Monica Beach & end of the Route 66 signs. Seen lots of shops, sellers, and eating places, we ate at Rusty's Surf Ranch- was great. Also visit Bubba Gump restaurant on the pier. Lots of rides for those who are interested. I walked to the end of the pier, was great to see. Would gladly return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisonlp
30,"Good to see, little to do","The pier caters to a certain type of traveler. For those traveling as couples, it is nice to sit and enjoy the beautiful California weather. However, you will run out of things to do very quickly. The pier is a fantastic place for families with young children. There is a small amusement park on the pier. Other than that, there is only a few restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meghanjansen

50,Vibrant Pier,"So much to see and do for all ages, you can go on the rides or just sit and people watch. Plenty of food options.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathycambell
50,My happy place! 😍,We spent the entire day at the pier! But I'll be taking sun screen next time ;) For $35 we had unlimited rides for the whole day! The cues weren't too bad at all and the food there was great and reasonably priced :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NatalieKeato
20,CRAZY CROWDS!!,"I was underwhelmed by Santa Monica. The pier is very overcrowded and overwhelming, and also felt dirty. The beach was extremely crowded! I do not care to return to Santa Monica. There are certain street that are nicer and cleaner than others, but overall I wasn't very impressed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lilyraby
50,Popular beach boardwalk in upscale urban area,"Came here on a weekday late afternoon and stayed till early evening. Saw the sign marking the end of Route 66. There are many shops, dining places, street performers. There are many rides available for those interested in rides. We enjoyed just walking the end of the boardwalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MGN777

50,Nice Pier Attraction,I was really impressed with how nice the Santa Monica area is! The Pier was very nice and well kept up. There were lots of attractions for the kids! It had lots of restaurants. It was a busy area though. I definitely felt safe. I was really impressed with the Pier and would definitely go back!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/177katlynt
50,Fun fun fun,"I went with a group of friends and we had such a good time. You can find a lot of cute stores in the pier to buy souvenirs and stuff like that, however, it does get crowed at times. The rides are really fun! You get a beautiful view of the ocean and this place is really cool to take photos. Personally for me, the water is TOO COLD to get in, but is a nice place to stroll a bit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauramjimenez
50,So much fun!,"We drove down the coast and stopped at the Santa Monica Pier. The beach was great! We even saw some sea lions froliicking in the ocean. We rode the ferris wheel and took photos. It was getting very busy when we were leaving around lunch time. They had artists, musicians and some freaky people. Great place for people watching!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/339cathyd
50,Loved it!!!!!,I meandered around every part of the pier and loved my time there. Did not ride the ferries wheel because the line was too long for my patience. The beach area is everything I envisioned it to be. Worth every mile we drove from South Mississippi.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaLou72
30,Must see if you're visiting. Avoid if you live here.,"The pier is one of those places that you have to see if you visit, but avoid if you live in LA. It is extremely touristy and crowded, but if you haven't seen it before you need to go. They have a restaurant/bar at the end of the pier, rides for kids, a fairly big arcade, ice cream, shopping, carnival games, etc. The views from the pier are magnificent as well. I am really glad I did it when I moved out here, but won't go back until my family comes to visit. It is extremely crowded and getting there can be a bit of a hassle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benkS4864RP
30,Something to Do,"We walked the pier in the morning. The amusement rides had not started operating yet and the only people there, outside of a few fishermen, were vagrants who were sleeping on the benches, a depressing site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoonerSteve
40,Lovely place,"Love Santa Monica pier - there is always something new to see and enjoy, whether live performances or a silent disco! Lots of stalls selling souvenirs, bars and restaurants offering selection of food and drink. Very touristy but an enjoyable experience, whether you jump on some of the rides or just take a stroll on the pier. Beautiful to walk down the pier at night and look back at the Santa Monica shoreline.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/momma1973
30,Not as nice,"The pier was widen and now has more rides and vendors. It also has Bubba Gump and Mariasol restaurants. Unfortunately, lots of people were smoking weed. So beware of second hand smoke especially with your small kids. Not coming back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielmT7958TD
40,Interesting!!,"It's nice to see it, a lot of people, parking some times it's difficultbit they have pubic parking close. They have a lot of different restaurants at the pier. Prices are high. The view at the beach is so beautiful, and it's interesting to see the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smiletraveling
50,Iconic California Landmark,"There's nothing better than standing on the edge of the pier looking out into the ocean and feeling the breeze on your face. This visit, some children's groups were playing music from the 80s and 90s for a small crowd that had gathered and I didn't want to leave. This is a must stop for anyone who hasn't been to California but also for the locals. I always want to carve out more time to spend there - hopefully next time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/918dewayneh
30,Interesting Enough,"But if you decide to skip the walk down the full pier, you won't have sacrificed anything. If you're looking for postcards, though, or a bunch of souvenirs, this is the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/399gingerr
40,What a pier should be,"The pier was full of people and life, the other pier I have visited was the Brighton one in the UK. They take you back to being a child, the smells, the food, and the people. Thus one had the added bonus of a lovely beach with soft sand beside it. Which my 10yr old took full advantage of and swam in. Worth the visit for young and old, if only to people watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/waimako
50,Beautiful view,The pier offers a beautiful view of the ocean. Many places to grab a snack or coffee along the pier. Plus access to the beach. Nice place to spend a beautiful day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiffanya976
50,Beauty and the Beach/ Beers and Burgers,"Great place to people watch and Big Dean's has great Beer and Burgers. From the peer head south on the walk path and Venice Beach is approx 2 miles away. That's where the real people watching experience is..... Must stop at Boardwalk Cafe and get a Colette Burger, if you already didn't hey one at Big Dean's :)That's a delish blue cheese burger. Watch people from all over the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coletteg704
40,must do,"stopped at the pier after a bile ride down the coast. apart from being the official end of Route 66 theres not an awful lot more to see. However its still a must see, the type of people attracted to this place is amazing, you can just sit and people watch for hours. a walk on to the pier gives you great views up and down the coast, you can also chat to the guys fishing off the pier. its worth planning a visit into your ittinery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M2573MTadrians
10,"South end on sea, With sun and lots of homeless","Not a great experience, you come across the homeless everywhere. The best thing you can do is ask for your spare food at the end of your meal (as they portions are gigantic) to go with plastic cutlery and then give out to the homeless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AT1
20,Tourists and Teenagers,"As a local this isn't someplace we visit unless a visiting guest insists. It's very tourist and youth focused. The views from the pier are nice, and it's an excellent spot for people watching. No dining options of note (there are some great spots nearby in Santa Monica). The beach below can get pretty insane, and it's a long walk (we like Will Rogers State Beach to the north). The bike trail below is excellent and runs for many miles along the coast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dollyamas
50,The Pier....,"A great place to have some fun especially with friends and children. You can have a ride with a rollercoaster too but don't miss the pier itself, there is a great view! There are some shopping area but should be more restaurants...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rikkarikka32
30,Nice enough,"If you're in Santa Monica then you're going to do the pier. It's a bit ""meh"". Nice views and some nice merchandise but ... nothing special. I'd wander a mile down the road to Venice Beach to soak up the atmosphere as the pier is nothing that special. We went to Pacific Park which was included on our Go Card. Again - fine, quite quaint but at rack rate? Not worth it. Nice roller coaster, all quite low tech (that's a compliment) but won't use up more than 90 minutes of your time unless the queues are horrendous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephanies15
50,The end of our journey,We had finally come to the end of our Route 66 journey and where better to end this than on Santa Monica pier at the end of the road sign. Perfect end to a perfect journey. Very busy pier but easy enough to get around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wannabeaussie
30,crowded and boring,"This pier is mainly for buying souvenirs, entertainment and eating. All the shops are selling similar things and food. It is quite boring.One of the restaurant called ""Beach Burger"". It is quite nice. You can try it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/852kwc
40,"Crazy People, Big Crowds, Japadogs!","The Pier has a lot of energy, the food is not bad (This is the only place place outside of Vancouver to get Japadogs) and the performers were fun to watch. Where else can you get jostled by an old Caucasian Michael Jackson, trip over active fishing lines all while eating a redhot buried in Japanese condiments? Fun place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4DaytonTravels
50,Better than what it looks like in the movies!,"Loved Santa Monica Pier! I couldn't help but smile the whole time of being there. Plenty of food to eat, souvenir shops (people don't hassle you to buy things either which is good), and of course the fun park. The rides aren't too expensive but they aren't cheap either. We went onto the Ferris wheel which gave us a great view of the pier and the beach.Venice Beach is a fair walk from Santa Monica Pier, maybe about 45 mins walk but you can hire bikes which will make it shorter.A must if you are in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natalievb1988
50,Lovely attractions with a beautiful outlook.,"It was a little tricky to get to from the centre of town and took a while in an Uber but was worth it. It was freezing when we went with the breeze off the ocean so go prepared! The rides were lots of fun, not for major thrills but a good laugh. We were there in the evening and caught the ferris wheel to watch the sunset, it was amazing! The place had a wonderful vibe and would recommend to families or those looking to escape the city for an afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E7840VYlaurac
40,Nice place,Lots of things are going on. The amusement park. People trying to attract audience to show their singing or playing skills. A nice promenad. People fishing. We got there to book the Malibu celebrety tour and took a walk until we took off to see the neighborhood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PerLundHansen
50,Gathering Place for All Ages,"My wife and I were here on a nice sunny weekday afternoon and enjoyed the stroll, the shops and amusement rides along the pier and a very talented one-man-band performing at the end of the pier. It's an easy walk into downtown, over to Muscle Beach and in and out of the shops along the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RCSColumbus
30,Family reunion,So busy & a lot of people. Fun atmosphere for kids. Lines were so long for everything. Not a good place for someone who can't walk long distance on uneven ground.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Honudolphinlover
30,First Time,"This was our first time to the pier. Its pretty old,and very crowded. Not many options to eat, but the views! they are really nice, took great pictures. The weather was nice, a bit chilly but nice!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claudiat470
50,Busy but great,Visited with my family including teenage and younger children. We had a great time there's something for everyone including fast food and some rides. The views are great along the coastline too. It is busy but somewhere like this is going to be popular. You can just sit and watch the world go by or get involved in what's on offer. Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScottH163
20,Disappointing,"We visited the pier and were very disappointed. Without a doubt, no worth $25 for parking. There were only a few places to eat, very little to see and only a couple of amusement park rides.Not worth fighting traffic to get here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmags
30,Great Tourist Place!,"If want a place to gawk at the locals and to absorb the ocean views, this is the place to go. It's very crowded with tourists and the rides/games are pricey, but this is one of the landmarks to see when in So Cal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/renakashmere
40,Ocean Time. Worth the Visit!,"Fun to visit. Especially if you love the ocean. People watch, hang out, grab a meal, hit a ride or two, even head down to the sand and jump in the ocean. Totally worth the time and effort. It was busy the day we went cuz there was a free concert that evening. We enjoyed it and would go again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JefeHenk
20,Crowded and overrated!,We thought the Santa Monica Pier would be fun as we were travelling with kids. But it was crowded and dirty and we didn't find the place pleasing at all. It was a disappointment obviously for all of us. It's probably nicer in other months when there are less people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nokko_o
40,Very Crowded at Night!,This is the place to be in Santa Monica! There are lots of things to do and see for people of all ages. It can get very crowded at night and the lines are long to get ice cream and ride the rides.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenniferJ45150
40,The pier,Nice way to spend a couple of hours.. I biked from Hermosa Beach so I gad a bit of a time constraint.Would recommend,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A6830OUpeterk
50,A must visit place!,Great place to have fun with friends and eat lunch! Great place for pictures also!! Souvenirs are sold around the place. If you have kids its definitely a must place to visit and have fun with kid with different games. The place offers a great view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WeRockTeam
40,Lovely place for family,"A great place for family visit. Bunch of rides, shops, & eating spots. I feel like I'm back as a 10 y/o kids wandering around the rides. Lovely place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rizkidwik
40,Great place to visit,"Our family had fun here, just to visit somewhere iconic. There is a great restaurant out on the end of the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leeannab2016
30,Always very crowded and not much to do there,It's crowed during the day and at night. Not sure why.. There's nothing to do there. That's just me. There are different street performers each day. Locals go there to fish at night. Vendors sells stuffs there on the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LIKEITIS1000
30,Sketchy,Would not go late at night with children. I did not feel safe with my 2 teenagers and we were at pier appx 8:30PM.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Payhay
30,LA visit,"I have reviewed this in part on the beach review but this is for the park holding the rides. This is ok but no Brighton and was expensive at $30 for a wrist band . The rollercoaster was a bit tired , the pirate ship was ok. There seemed other rides but it was so busy we went for a walk instead. There were Food outlets but they were very busy and no real seating. Loved the pier itself but the park was average",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveEatingOut6
30,Basic entertainment but amazing view and weather,It was fascinating weather in the afternoon and evening. Late evening you. Red a jacket and that's in July especially with sea breeze.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nidaleo
40,Decent tourist stop,"With time to kill prior to Disneyland I took my family to the Santa Monica Pier.I found it to be incredibly beautiful and a fun short stop for photos and picking up small souvenirs- especially when I found this is end of the line for Route 66.A few issues were:I found getting there/parking to be extremely challenging. Parking was affordable and the beach walk to the pier mid morning/afternoon was comfortable and not too crowded.We left at 3pm because it was getting incredibly crowded and the personalities were getting to colorful for my liking (not vegas colorful - but not family friendly per se).In summary if your a tourist seeking beach attractions this was a great beach spot (photo view from pier to the North) and activity location, however, go early and leave early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/424cjs
50,Great Vibe,We stayed in Santa Monica so the pier was walking distance. Although a main attraction once you actually get to it there is not much to do. Yes they have the carnival rides and a few stalls. It is definitely a must if you are in LA to tick off the bucket list but typically 30mins there is enough- if you dont have any kids.We stayed for the sunset and had ice cream.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/althy2
20,Doesn't live up to the reputation...,"I'm afraid the movies and what not will set you up for disappointment when visiting the pier. It's just a run down pier, with cheesy food stands, and mediocre rides. My advise... skip it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gnuckolls
40,Fun and a Must Do!,"We were on a mission to complete Route 66 in Southern California over two days, so we started on the Santa Monica pier, even though the sign says the ""end of Route 66"". We stopped in to the 66 to Cali kiosk shop at the start of the pier. We talked with Ian for quite a while and he is a wealth of knowledge for anything relating to Route 66 and they have some great 66 items, everything is made in the U.S.A and I love to support that.After speaking with Ian, we walked the pier, watching tourists and kids have a ball. Everyone was enjoying a beautiful sunny day with the rides, attractions and little shops.We arrived early and were able to park on the pier making it easy to get around. The pier is a fun spot to spend a morning or afternoon in a beautiful beach town, surrounded by the Pacific Ocean.The pier is just that a wooden, iconic Southern California pier, it is worn and made with wood planks, but is full of fun and a tradition when in the area. Do it at least once, you can't help but smile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beetrvln
10,Tourist Trap - Avoid,"Overpriced for poor quality goods and services. A waste of time and should be avoided. Aside from it being a well know part of Santa Monica, drive by and just see it from your car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HenryJ88
10,Scared lots of Hobos,"The Santa Monica pier is filled with Hobos. They come directly up to you to either sell you something or just exchange mean comments to you when you walk by them. I saw a lot of them yelling, talking to themselves and digging through trash cans for food. My children were frightened. We wanted to walk down to Muscle beach but was on guard the entire time. Not worth it and won't ever come back to the area. The beach was nice and fantastic views. We stayed at the Georgian hotel and it was just okay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/721TR
50,Plan to spend a day,"We thought we would just pop in and pop out for a quick visit. You can't! We got there close to sunset, rode the roller coaster and of course the Ferris wheel (a must). Grabbed some food and some souvenirs and we left. We were tired and hungry from driving from San Francisco the same day but very easily could have spent the entire day and enjoyed the beach as well. The pier is so big! We paid the premium and parked right there at pier parking. They had a sunset concert going on so not only were there tourists but also locals as well. It's nice to know that locals don't shy away from the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickAlixMom
50,nice view,"i recommand you to visit santa monica pier, nice view from the pier, the sea, the beach, we saw 3 dolphins jumping just close to the pier, beautifull",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OlivierP275
30,Nothing special about it,"Although this is an attraction of Los Angeles, it was nothing special. Just a long beach with a pier and a few children's games for the kids to have fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AntoNic7
50,LA's best sunset,"A cool way to spend an afternoon, the pier is pretty cool and has some basic rides and eateries while the sunsets are spectacular. Back on land, 3rd street has some great shopping and plenty of places to get a good meal. I'd much rather spend my time here than at Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sh0wtimeb
40,You've Got To Do It ... Once!,"Went for a walk out on the Pier which I just felt I had to do as it's one of those famous landmarks that you want to see! I also visited there about 5 years ago when it was very quiet ... today was so busy which makes it difficult to walk along the pier, let alone stop and look at anything.An interesting place to go and make sure you take your picture on the bench outside Bubba Gumps! However, just choose a time when you can stroll along and enjoy it rather than spend your time trying to dodge people and prams!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoanneFromPerth
30,Getting a Bit worn,The place needs a good wash-- smells bad and could use a bit of a make over. Still enjoyed by kids and even spotted a tween celebrity from musica.ly that kids recognized and were excited to take a pic with.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/132gpp
40,Crowded but nice to take pictures,"It's a very busy and crowded area and parking will take some patience. They have crossing guards to help pedestrians cross the streets safely. The pier has some restaurants and shops as well as vendor booths. I didn't play any games or go on any rides, but they looked fun. The pier is a great place to take pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rlm_travelers
50,Fantastic,"Fun, food, entertainment--all on Santa Monica Pier. Lots of cheap places to eat, and the ferris wheel at night is a must do. Great for the young and old!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/953renam
30,Carnival like atmosphere,"I did a job walk for repair work on the pier and did the full tour.It is pretty much the same as I remember, a carnival by the ocean with the benefits of a beach and pier.Restaurants, shops and rides with one of the older carousel's on the west coast. Great views and street entertainment with fishing at the end of the pier.Down sides are that it gets very crowded at night and during the summer. Parking is $12 and sells out the later you go. Go early and bring your chair and towel for a full Beach day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterlP2566QG
50,Iconic,The Pier is iconic-- your trip is not complete without a stroll to the end. But it is crowded and so be prepared for that. There are parking lots on 2nd street and Broadway or Santa Monica that are much cheaper and just a few blocks away. And you can see the Promenade too!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/223jillc
40,Tourist Location,The Santa Monica pier is a must see but it is also super crowded most of the time. I've been there numerous times but I feel like it continues to get more crowded. Really good place to take a picture though!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MNicoleS375
40,Has a bit of everything for all ages.......!!!,"Been there twice and loved my visit. The water is clear enough to enjoy unlike the Long Beach and then you have the pier to enjoy the evening. If you have kids, they will absolutely love it. The only issue I had was with the shower facilities which were not working properly. Should have some sort of paid facilities where you can clean up after a dip in the water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gunuhere
50,"Bubba Gump Shrimp Co, Route 66",Love this place. Water was blue and clean. Small but nice board walk. Took photos with historic Route 66 singe. But the best part was Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. Could relate with the move easily. Waiters are friendly and know what they are doing. Their food was good too. We enjoy the pier a lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Soarin2016
50,Santa Monica Pier is a MUST see!,"If you find yourself in Santa Monica, you MUST visit this iconic destination. The only issue my family had was a broken ride we were on. Luckily we had a guardian angel in front of us holding down the bar.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amkaye
30,"Bustling with people, nice views",This was my second time visiting Santa Monica so I took a stroll down the Pier at about 5 PM on the weekend of the 4th of July. Busy place but good people watching. I was going to buy a few postcards but didn't have anything under a $20 and the vendor didn't want to break it. Not a big deal but I found it odd. I kind of think that once you have seen it you don't need to go back. Although I did the next morning for some cardio on the beach. It was so quiet and peaceful...such a change from the night before.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mdluvs2shop
50,Santa Monica Pier great for families,"My husband and I walked from Venice Beach to Santa Monica Pier, took us about 90 mins but was a very nice walk to do on a Saturday afternoon. The pier was huge with the Big Ferris Wheel which could be seen all the way back to Venice Beach.Lots of places to eat and cute little touristy shops and markets to see. Highly recommend! Be prepared for the crowds and they are huge and although we didn't drive, we could see the parking lot was choc-a-block full.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheChocolateOne
50,"Fun games, not as rigged",Actually won at basketball and knocking over the clowns. Way more fair and better priced than the county fair.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X9153ZWmikek
40,Good place to stop!,"We went over 4th July weekend and plenty going on with concerts, carnival rides, and other entertainment. Seems to always be a must to stop in on.Nearby shopping is good with street entertainers as well!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonerbandit
30,Worth a Walk Through,Pretty for a stroll. Rides are limited and it appears to need a bit of a facelift. Walk all the way to the end for a pretty view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KSL65
40,Good experience,It was a good experience to walk this pier being the end point of Route 66. Heaps of eateries and entertainment options. Good for people watching. A good view of the beach from here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaniceL638
50,Fun in the Sun at Santa Monia Pier,"Santa Monica is a great place to visit for a full day of sun, fun, eating and shopping. In addition to the beach, there's the famous Ferris Wheel which is surrounded by other rides. Santa Monica Pier has the typical beach junk food, but there's also restaurants including Bubba Gump's Shrimp!If you walk up the hill and over the highway, there's a park area great for walking and leisure activities. Across the street are more restaurants. However, walking a few blocks further you run into the 3rd Street Promenade where you'll find shopping and more restaurants. The 3rd Street Promenade area is blocked off to cars, only encountering them when crossing over to the next block of stores. You can browse the stores or window shop.I've visited the pier 3 times and each time, I spend almost a full day there. It's great family fun; something for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatyD12345
50,Keep coming back,"I never miss an opportunity to visit the pier when in SM. Always something new to discover and it offers visitors free live music, various choices of good/ beverages and amusement park rides. Great views of SM and the ocean. Not to miss when in SM.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rafoush12013
40,Busy landmark,"It is a landmark of Santa Monica. Fairly large for a pier. Some attractions for kids. It is a kind of ""check-in"" places in LA. Although is fun to jog along the beach and just pass it by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ksksksksks
50,Good for a Day Trip,I like to travel up from Orange County to here because its always got great weather and interesting people and things to see. Its always a great time to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessee04
50,Awesome night of fun!,"This is 100% a must do if you're in the area at any time of day! We did it just after sunset/ dinner and it was awesome! Bright lights, reasonably cheap - $30 USD gets you unlimited rides! Our favourite was definitely the shark ride!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgiar251
40,The end of Route 66,"This was our stopping point for our Route 66 trip. The pier is crowded with shops, restaurants, people, performers, an arcade, and several carnival rides. It's a fun place for an afternoon, but that's about all. Check it out, walk the beach, and maybe eat something if you want (it's kind of pricey, although the pizza I got was better than I expected). One of those bucket list things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pedrogN2672PA
40,HUGE !,"This pier is huge in comparison to most on the east coast I am used to. A lot of people, and a ton going on. It was nice to see the pier had more than just rides or games on the water. The far end had fishing and dolphin watching, as well as people just relaxing to a sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicholaspY4352MC
40,Excellent for people watching,It's a busy part of town however for good reason.If you're into people watching and just admiring the weird & wonderful then you'll really enjoy it here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeanTownDale
40,Small but cool,"The pier was smaller than I thought it would be, but it was crammed with varying levels of entertainer from a talented drummer all the way to guy who couldn't sing or play the guitar killing Eric Claptons ""Wonderful tonight"" but he was entertaining. The funfair was worth playing the little games on just be prepared to end up with soft toys!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The8ears
40,Coney islands twin,"Crowded, loud, obnoxious, but you must walk to the end of the pier just to say you've done it. Don't get food there, it's over priced and mediocre. Walk out of the pier and onto the street for actual food. Not what I imagined, but had to walk to the end of the pier regardless of course.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kingsley313
30,Too Crowded for me but glad I saw it,"Busy, expensive rides, pier performers, and lots of food. Glad that I went and saw it once. I don't need to see it again. So many lovely parts of California to see...the Pier was not one of them. Just very, very crowded. If I had the option, I would bypass Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/connief517
20,"Overcrowded, overpriced and a generally a rip off joint","It's a pier like any other, except its very crowded and has lots of overpriced shops, restaurants ams a couple of overpriced rides. In addition there were some people trying to dupe you into signing up for some sort of time share deal by entering a 'free' draw.If you have more money than sense &/or like overcrowded places, then this place is for you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Xhara71
50,So much fun,This was a must stop for us and trust me you want to visit here. The pier takes you back to a long forgotten past and was so much fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/love2beme
30,Mid-week visit,I visited with my husband and my four year old daughter. The food selection is a bit limited but we didn't mind and we both waited in two seperate lines. Once we both got our food we realized there wasn't one empty table so we had to wait in the 90 degree weather with a hungry four year old. A bottle of water costs 4 dollars which is pricey but we purchased two and then headed to the ferris wheel. The price for the ferris wheel was 8.50 per person and I wouldn't pay that price for three people based on principle. Instead we went to the arcade for air hockey and ended up at chuckie-cheese. It's nice to walk around but it is very expensive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Creativesensations
40,Nice place for a couple hours.....,"I was in town with my 2 teenage girls.... the rides there are better suited for younger kids... but we rode the ferris wheel.... and walked around.... fun to watch the "" street performers..... we went July 4....so it was packed... I'm sure other days are a bit more relaxing..... we had a nice time all in all.... I would recommend definitely if you have small kids and if you're kids ( any age) like watching performers and the ocean.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RockyDZ
40,Unique Tourist Spot,"Very touristy, but loads of fun! This pier has shops, restaurants, amusement rides, fishing, and all sorts of street artists and performers. What a great setting, over the water with the ocean breeze. Great place to walk and explore and find about anything you need, and lots of things you just want. A hopping place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/935judahj
50,Great place for afternoon waters,"This is a great place filled with entertainment, street artists, beach, bicycle riding, boardwalk, etc. Be sure to arrive by afternoon so that you can take advantage of the whole place before sunset. Because of the hills, you won't be able to get a good sunset view. If you get to Ocean Av., you will be greeted by expensive parking and restaurants. Park slightly away and enjoy the evening dinner in the area's appealing restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sub580
40,Fun but busy,"I was so excited about visiting Santa Monica Pier and it didn't disappoint!Colourful, bustling and lots of friendly faces makes it an ideal place to spend a few hours and maybe have a meal at Bubba Gump (although the wait time was too long for us, should have booked).Weekends are extremely busy though where they have live music and traffic is often at a standstill trying to park.Definitely worth a visit and a go on the fairground rides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joannecU8298BM
30,Ho Hum...disappointing experience,"After the constant buildup of how awesome the Santa Monica pier is we were left vaguely empty. Yeah it was busy and yeah there were some real people watching opportunities but the attractions, shops, food and general atmosphere was a disappointment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigDaddyShepperz
30,"Overated, crowded, and expensive","This place was my biggest disappointment on a recent long visit to California. Very crowded and expensive and it wasn't as large or have as much to do ad I thought it would. Some of the food was pretty bad too. On the good side, it only cost $1.25 to park for 2 hours at parking lot 6.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RestaurantBully
20,Went just to say I've been there,"I wasn't impressed with the pier or restaurants. Seemed to be a mini tourist trap. Beyond walking to the end of the pier, there wasn't anything that was tempting to spend money on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jameswQ1575MC
30,Typical seaside pier.,"Coming from a seaside area in the UK we are very used to typical seaside piers. All the usual things, cafes, fairground attractions etc. Can get very busy and when it does you just have to follow along with the crowd! Probably wouldn't bother with the Pier next time as there are much nicer things to see in Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeandWendy01
50,Must see!,This was a place we had to go to and it didn't disappoint. The kids were very excited to go and had a blast once there. Must see on your trip. Rollercoaster and Ferris wheel on the pier. Beautiful views as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingDad84
40,Vacation with family,Went here after dinner. Nothing extremely special except it is an iconic place featured in many movies. Was very crowded (uncomfortably) and most places had a line to get in. The view of the mountains were beautiful and there were plenty of street performers to watch. Was a good place for me to check off my bucket list.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wayne1833
30,Overrated,Basically the have the stuff you get at your county fair stuffed into a pier....only not quite as good. It was crowded with basically a fair atmosphere of vending etc. I saw no reason to return.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tim_21617
50,Breathtaking View,"Went to the Pier on June 20th. An amazing sunset and a vibe that cant be described.Took my 13 yr old daughter and we had an amazing evening.Rode a lot of ride, played some games, enjoyed the view and listened to music.A cant miss place if you are in the area",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/984marky
40,Busy!!,"We arrived on an evening where there was a scheduled concert so the Pier and surrounding area were very busy. Difficult to find parking, but we managed. Area was clean, security was available as were extra port-a-potties for the larger crowds. We decided not to ride at the pier due to crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanineP40
40,Interesting historic pier,"This pier is massive! Cars drive on half of it and there is a parking lot, on the pier. Lots of interesting people to watch, places to eat, and buy souvenirs. There's also a game room and some carnival rides. Street performers abound. Fun and a must see in Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helium571truth
40,A good combination with walking along the beach,"We cycled along the beach from venice beach to santa monica and enjoyed it very much! Its a good advise to do the pier also. The people, the music, the sea -- its a happy place to see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yuvalavargil
30,Overrated,We came here expecting this to be the highlight of our trip. We were a little disappointed. There were so many people we could barely got a picture in. We had to wait over an hour just to pay for parking. It might be better on a quieter day but I would stay far away on any Saturday or Sunday.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/150jacobm
40,Splash of sensory pleasure,"Sta. Monica Pier is your typical boardwalk. I visited late afternoon when the lights were just starting to come out. The sounds and the lights- they come together with the generally happy crowd of people. It is a happy place. I could feel everyone just wanted to have a good time with the rides, the eats and the simple sights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cindyr87
40,So Many People,There were just too many cars and people on. Saturday afternoon that we decided to go back at 7:30 on Sunday morning. It was still and quiet. Peaceful looking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/502deborahr
50,So iconic!,We loved visiting the pier. Loved the atmosphere. You can park quite close. We had dinner in the Mexican restaurant at the end of the pier it was delicious. Kids loved the rides and games.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Embreys
30,Must see - crowded though,This is a place you have to check out when you are here. Don't expect too much though. Depending on the day it can be super busy. If you are lucky you catch a great street entertainment. There is always plenty of that going on. We enjoyed it. It's not a place to hang out though for my taste. It's easy to get to and plenty of parking all around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DartmouthOxford1212
50,a lot of great people watching,"the pier is almost always crowded, so people watching is pretty good there....if you like looking at touriststhere is a Mexican restaurant at the end of the pier where you can outside and look at the oceanthere is a giant ferris wheel for a great view of the area, and at night it's a wonderful light showthere is an arcade with air hockey and a bunch of games......and a little roller coaster and those sorts of rides for little kids...... during the summer there are free concerts on the pier every Thursday night",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/airbrush1212
30,What you'd expect I guess,"Not many rides, but lines weren't that long. Seemed kind of dingy to us vs the beauty of rest of SAnta Monica. Could use some updating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soldout0
50,Fun time!,Kids had a blast! We got wristbands through our Go City LA card and was well worth it! The rides were fun. The Gerri's wheel gave a great view of the ocean and area.Tons of fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/591debl
50,"Perfect for tweens, teens and families!","There are a few rides, games, shops and eateries here. We LOVED the pier and it had a lively night crowd which our teens loved. We were there late and enjoyed every moment! The rides are kind of pricey. I would compare this to a small town county fair.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tborntreger
50,A bit average....,This is better to view from afar .... up close... not really much to do.. a few restaurants and rides if you have young kids... and more homeless people than young kids.... the homeless around here is really really bad!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davide160
20,Cool from a distance,Ok let's be honest the Santa Monica Pier is iconic! It's beautiful and very cool at night from a distance! Stopped after dinner to check it out and to get an ice cream cone. Place is down right dirty. Smelled of garbage and just a lot of unsavory looking people. Sadly disappointed! But cool from the distance. It does not appear to stay open very late so check the times if planning to take a walk to the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BethO265
40,Came back to my childhood favorite,"Love the Pier, lived in LA and moved up North to Sacramento! This is a must visit if you come to LA, fun, fun fun!!! Enjoy the rides food & outdoor concerts!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kkpaws14
30,Great stopover,"We visited during our stopover in LA, we enjoyed the pier but we weren't overly impressed. The view of sunset was good but harassment from vagrants was annoying.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amysU8368WF
30,1998 since I've been on the pier,Been a few years since I've been here but looks somewhat similar. A few new restaurants and stands but still same good old family/first date kind of fun. Walked over from Third street promenade area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jedimasterkush
50,Beautiful atmosphere,"Must visit when you are in LA, great live music,lovely beach, relaxed environment, good shopping area, kids friendly",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinehz188

30,Nice place to visit,Not as large as I expected. Nice walk near the ocean and interesting historical information. Would be great if you have kids and don't want the large theme park atmosphere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EATBFLO
40,Good Place and Good View,I visited Santa Monica by my friend car and use car park that far from the bay but not bored .When you walk to the street have more shop and more food store to sightseeing and there have a little code weather in the Evening.You can bring you dog to walk around and have some seat when you want to relax too.When you walk to the amusement park with the food court there too.There have souvenir shop and some restaurant.You can walk to the beach for take some photo and there have car park at the beach too but that was expensive too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAYTRIEMME

30,Petrified,"My three daughters were petrified. They wanted to leave. Wet crowded and many ""strange"" people. A few restaurants that I do t think I would eat at. A few gift shops that you might find something at. Beautiful view of the beach. Walked to end and walked right back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F3270BPnicolek
40,Beautiful beach,Beautiful clean pier. Love the Mexican restaurant at end of pier. Excellent service and friendly staff love the music .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janetp658
50,End of the Road,This was our final stop on Route 66 after driving from Chicago. We parked in the carpark on the pier and posed for a photo in front of the Route 66 sign on the pier. Felt a great sense of achievement. Then spent a couple of interesting hours exploring the attractions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrantHay
40,Very Touristy,"Must see when in Santa Monica, very touristy but well worth the visit. Lot's of fun rides, had dinner on the pier and was a decent as well. Check out the carousel, not many around and it is beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allanr344
40,Little things if you look around.,I went during some free time while on a business trip. It doesn't take long to visit especially if you don't have kids with you. Good for photos and people watching. Don't expect disney level amount of things to do or see but just go and relax. Good for getting some touristy trinket or watching the sunset over the hills to the north. If you like to fish you can do that here too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/photogeis
40,Good tourist spot,"If you are looking for a California experience, this is worth a visit. There are 2 large parking lots at the entrance. Lots of parking (we got there at 1230 on a Tues in the summer and there were still plenty of spots. Still spots when we left at 330). Go walk the pier, have a drink or lunch and ride the Ferris wheel. Dont bother with the coaster it is very slow. Don't bother with the wristband. Plan to spend 2 to 3 hours. Great photo opps.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karleys2013
20,Stay away on Thursday nights,"Weird street performers, waaaaaay too many people. We got caught in a huge human traffic jam for 45-60 mins because there was some sort of concert going on at the pier. Apparently concerts are held on Thursday nights.It was awful.From far away it's pretty with the ferris wheel, but it's not worth it to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soniagraf
20,Good for Tourist,"The Famous SM Pier is just a collection of chain restaurants, junk food, vendors selling tourist junk and a few rides. It does overlook a great beach and offers incredible views, but only go there if you want to check it off of your LA sites to visit. Much better options are available to experience this great city and coast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffn146
50,A must!!,The end of our Route 66 had to be on Santa Monica Pier the actual end of the line!! Loads of interesting things to look at and buy as well as rides and great eateries!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LanzaroteCruiser
20,Not impressed,"The pier gets way too crowded during peak hours. There are too many street vendors making way to much noise. They are so close they drowned each other out. All of the rides seem somewhat dated. It is worth 20 minutes of your time to walk out and back, but I can assure you that you won't do it twice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I2099SWpatrickw
30,"Nice, but nothing too exciting","We liked walking on the pier. A lot of little carts or pop up merchants all kinda peddling the same stuff. One interesting tid bit, old Route 66 officially end at t ghe pier! Public restrooms available. Parking is a bit difficult.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Herrin79
20,Santa Monica Pier,The Santa Monica Pier was horrible it was over crowded and there was trash everywhere. I was glad i did it but i would never do it again. The only cool thing were all of the carnival games which you could actually win at.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phosford10
50,Great place to Hangout in the Evening,We visited in the evening about an hour before sunset. It was a Tuesday... and boy was it crowded. The parking lot was full so my husband dropped us off and went to look for parking. He ended up finding parking in an outdoor shopping mall about a 5-10 minute walk away.Great place to people watch. Lots of entertainers doing their thing trying to earn some money. Some were more pushy than others with regards to asking for tips. Lots of carnival like food to eat but also sit down places like Bubba Gumps. They have a carnival rides that cost a lot to ride on. The ferris wheel cost over $8 per ticket. It was worth it to us though.It is a great place to spend an evening and to see the sun set. My year old loved it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T5048XHmariat
40,Good place to kill a couple of hours,"It is a huge pier complete with restaurants, street musicians, souvenir shops, and amusement park. There are beautiful sunset views.The pier has mostly street food but it's still delicious including burgers, tacos and funnel cakes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joryr
30,Heart of Santa Monica,Well it's still the heart of Santa Monica with lots of visitors and lots of overpriced stuff to sell for them. It is worth to spend not more than 15 minutes on it unless you are going to use a carousel or have a lunch. Some places are offering quite good seafood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/415mildab
40,Full of character,I arrived at the pier in the evening which was extremely busy. However it has much character. The highlight for me was going on the ferris wheel which was a good opportunity to take photos of the coastline.If you have time available I would advice to get a full attraction pass to take in all the rides on the pier which works out at a lot better value.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashbobs1211
30,Just your average amusement peir,"We had to go since we were staying in Santa Monica. I am glad we went, but not something I would want to do again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fredl794
30,Unimpressed,I was not impressed with the Pier. I guess I had high expectations. There are only a few rides. We did not eat on the pier; we ate on the other side of the street. I would rather visit the Jersey Shore piers or the Galveston Pier.I did like watching the performers. The guy playing the sitar was pretty good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bphpsu
40,Hustle,"It's the end of Route 66 but the start of hustle & bustle . The vibe is happy & friendly with an eclectic mix of all nations & tourists alike .Street performers, carnival food and views of the beach & ocean are great after mid morning if there around "" June gloom "" time .Walks either side of pier are worth it as Venice beach is south..Have fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/642piersb
30,meh. looks nothing like it did in it's heyday,"Having been to Santa Cruz boardwalk many times, I was expecting something similar. This had just a few rides, nothing exciting. The ferris wheel (which someone told us was the most photographed attraction besides the Eiffel Tower?!) was small and unexciting. Don't go here just for the boardwalk. But if you're already at the beach, give it a look",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tarzan2613
30,Not impressed,Bad wifi in the Pier and there is coaster ride around there. The only eye catching is the Route 66 end of trail sign,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jeffrey_Teh_2000
50,Great place to visit,The pier had a vast amount of things to do outside of the beach area. We had dinner at Bubba Gumps and had a fun time on the rides and walking around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nosha22
20,Cheap carnival atmosohere,Chincy and cheap carnival atmosphere filled with dirty people. Walmart on the water really. Take a pass.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anagorski
50,Finally Put My Feet in the Ocean,"After 4 years of visiting LA I got here, and put my feet in the ocean.Was just a lovely place to visit and sit and relax.Was a little disappointed the rides were closed for a private event but this was a spur of the moment visit so that part was our fault.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ledbytheunknown
30,just a pier!!!!,was a tat dissapointed with this visitwas very old lots of overpriced gift shops as youd expectfew singers and groups on the pier .we didnt go on any of the rides very busy when we wentjust on parr with scarborough pierr lol but hotnot really a place id return hyped up 2 much,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaz4040
40,Interesting beach pier area,We visited this in the morning as we were still used to eastern time. Wasn't very busy then but was getting busy by time we left. We paid $12 to park down on the beach next to the pier instead of on the pier itself which is more expensive. The area was kind of dirty but not horrible. We walked down the pier and then down the beach to the muscle beach area which my boys liked. Neat place to check out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/267toddw
50,Fun fun fun,"I grew up in LA and as an adult moved to a different state. Now that I have my own child we came here for a visit. It still has that nostalgic feel to it when I came to visit. Same rides and games. Many shops, restaurants, and street performers. Definitely a good night out with the family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/368edithc
30,A Must See But Just The Once,"We were in LA so had to visit the iconic pier, if just for photos, especially at the Route 66 End Of The Trail sign. Apart from that there was really nothing else for us to get excited about. There were amusements, rides, stalls, buskers etc which are not really our cup of tea but may appeal to others.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/newspapertaxi
30,Ok,"This place is ok, like many piers of city's that has one. Lots of little shop mostly souvenirs. You could visit this in 1 hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JPN65Montreal_Canada
40,Busy,The usual stuff - food and rides but very busy. Suitable for families and there's a gimmicky sign indicating the end/start of route 66 for a photo and a small interesting information point at the end of the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saturnstan
30,A tad disappointed.,This was a stop on our Starline city and beach tour and it was somewhere i had dreamed of visiting after seeing in movies so often..It seemed a romantic and fun destination..In reality i was disappointed.The pier fun park area is looking a bit tired but it did have some fun rides for all ages.The iconic ferris wheel and a dark dingy amusement games arcade. The beach at Santa Monica has a wide sandy beach but it wasnt anything special. The boardwalk was so busy with skaters and cyclists.It is a great people watching place..A highlight was the muscle men showing off on the beach near the pier on swing ropes etc. Hilarious!I felt their seemed poor food or cafe options around the pier.We didn't get to Venice beach close by..i wonder if the beach is more attractive there and facilities a little less run down looking?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Janine45
40,Worth a visit even if it's just for photos,We ere excited to visit the pier. It's a iconic place. The view were great and it was great for people watching. There were quite a few homeless people about but they weren't aggressive or intrusive. Probably wouldn't visit again but glad we went.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P4787VQpaulas
10,Not for me,"This place itself is nice; however, I do not like the crowd it attracts. I have visited many times, but do not like. Personal opinion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jerusalmit12
50,Full of activities,This place is full of activities. It's beautiful & full of people. I loved the board walk. Kids enjoy a lot on the beach. Nice eateries too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/singhalanju
40,Love a pier,"I loved the pier, I'm from a UK seaside town and piers hold a special place in my heart. We had hotdogs off a vendor and juts walked around soaking up the atmosphere. Highlight of SM for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amandamonkey
30,Limited appeal,I love a pier. But this one didn't have much to grab me - limited food outlets and expensive rides ($8.50 to ride the Ferris wheel felt steep). Parking costs $13. Beautiful views along the beach. But we didn't stay long.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wombling_Free_7548
20,Meh,"I booked our hotel near the pier but we enjoyed the other things we did more -- a surf lesson with Nick at Santa Monica Surf School, shopping on 3rd street, Venice beach skaters, AbbottKenny street shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lyncauwels
40,Interesting & Family Friendly,"We made this our first stop in LA. The weather was a little gloomy so we didn't actually venture down to the water, but the pier gave us great views of the ocean and the paddle board races that were going on. We stopped at a little burger stand for lunch. Seating was limited but the food was good. There were a bunch of souvenir stands set up along the pier as well that were fun to poke around. Our favorite stop by far was the arcade. It's filled with good mix of old (Galaga, Pac Man, Skee-ball, air hockey) as well as new games (there is this updated version of Galaga that plays on a huge screen). We skipped the amusement park itself but there were a few rides (roller coaster, tilt a whirl) as well as a nicely done carousel). If you plan to come out, definitely don't forget your walking shoes, sunscreen and a swim suit if their weather permits!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catchthis0905
50,Don't want to miss this out!,"I came here for a walk and didn't expect myself to spend around 3 hours here. The atmosphere was really relaxing here, with many performers which made it more special. Took many nice photos here and totally didn't want to leave, so I stayed to see the sunset and it was super worth it. Definitely come here!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cshanneen
40,Very family oriented,"First time visiting the Pier, we parked in the main parking lot which I think was $12. Lots of families and kids on the pier, which is nice to see. Plenty of places to eat and to shop. You also get a very pretty view of the beach and the ocean. Santa Monica was a bit congested but the pier was easy to find.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandam200
40,Sunrise. Sunset. Iconic views!,Known from thousands of postcards and movies - this is a must visit when in LA. The sunset over the pier is My favourite but the Sunrise is Beautiful too. Easy parking If arriving by car. Easy Walking acess from the Beach or Third street. Lots of food options on the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karesson
50,I love this pier,"This is my favorite pier to visit. We came here this year to mark the end of our Route 66 trip. The highway ends on the pier. Souvenirs are expensive, but I suppose that's to be expected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lmmarley
40,A must visit site,"If you're in Santa Monica you have to go to the pier just for the experience. You don't have to ride the rides to enjoy a stroll on the crowded pier. It's a great place to people watch. Stay away if you don't like crowds, but that's part of the charm of the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hooisergal
50,A fun Saturday,Had a nice walk on the pier watching the street performers and artist on a beautiful Saturday. THe views are beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenJen1865
50,Captivating,"A sight for sore eyes. Coming here always keep me relaxed (despite the long walks!) and calm (despite the diverse crowd!). Not as if I don't live in a small island with so much water and sand, but it's the crazy fun activities that you can do here and lots of deeeelicious fresh food available anywhere in this part of town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annaohh
40,Cool,"Very historical. Pier is in good shape and surrounded by a very well maintained beach. Plenty of for pay parking nearby. Not a huge variety of food, and it is on the higher price side.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/esp33kych
40,Definitely a must do if you're visiting Santa Monica!,We enjoyed walking the pier in the evening but found it much more enjoyable in the morning. The evening has a lot more teenagers and is elbow to elbow.The pier has a lot of food options and has plenty of live entertainment. There are a few shops but you are better off going to 3rd street for shopping.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattmanmd
50,Fun! Fun! Fun!,Pier over Pacific Ocean with amusement park was the most fun kids had. Arcades and games!! Lots of walking!! But a beautiful view of Ocean !!!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V8813SClindam
40,Good Old Fun,"Unlike the modern theme parks, this place offers the traditional rides and food. In its unique way, it is a romantic place to visit. That is if you can avoid the crowd of tourists that flock the place. Still, it is a must see in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adelucia
30,Not worth much of your time,"This pier was a disappointing visit for me. I thought it would be a very ""California"" / ""LA"" experience but was let down and wouldn't recommend wasting more than an hour here. It felt dirty. Dining options seemed terrible. I searched for anywhere decent to eat and sadly, the Bubba Gump Shrimp Factory seemed like the best choice - ugh. Not too many things to do, even the scenery was nothing to write home about. Glad that I saw it but wouldn't go back in the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kkolodz
50,Forest Gumps eastern boundary.,What a lovely pier. We spent a happy few hours wondering around and did a few of the fairground rides then had dinner at Bubba Gumps. Really pleasant time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IanDaley
30,Crowds!,"The crowds here were intense... Great walk from Venice beach to the pier, but once there we left quite fast...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/corrie563
40,Retro Cool,"Its touristy, it can be crowded, it has carnival type rides and games but its still very cool. Highly recommend if staying anywhere near there rent bike or scooter and cruise down from SM/the pier to Venice. lOts to see and do. The pier has an arcade that had 4 way air hockey which I had never seen before. If in the area it should be visited",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sccrref
40,End of Route 66,"We had a few hours to kill before a connecting flight home and came here to see what was on offer. Whilst it would be amazing fun for kids its a very pleasant place for adult too, and until our visit I never knew it was the end of Route 66. In surrounding streets lots of great pubs and restaurants make it a far better option that hanging around at the airport.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U6958ZKthomasp
50,A Must,"A great area to visit, easy to get to on the Hop On Hop Off bus. Plenty of shops and eating options either on the pier or on the street. A great carnival feel",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chookalooka65
50,Beautiful,"Lovely day out, went back a few days later. The pier is pretty cool and the beach is beautiful. Easy walk down to Venice beach as well. The actually carnival on the pier is pretty cool, lots of food and souvenirs and the area is white nice. Free WiFi in the city area. Worth a visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julzi91
40,"Free admission, armband for rides","This pier is legitimately made of old wood. We parked on the pier and as you walk along toward the amusement park, you are walking on uneven board planks. It is so nostalgic and lovely. You are able to see the water between the planks and see all of the nuts and bolts of the structure. The amusement park is nice. There are rides and games. It is clean and looked well maintained. The game stands were not annoying as some carnivals can be. The rides are colorful and there is a nice variety. We appreciated not having to pay for admission to the pier as some places do. At the end of the pier, there were people fishing and a nice restaurant that smelled really good. There were also bathrooms that were well kept - they seem to constantly be cleaning them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lollie777
40,"Tourist central, pretty views",Everything you might expect from a tourist trap. Plenty of overpriced trinkets and t shirts on sale. Pretty views off the pier of santa Monica beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L9523YEalanm
40,Beautiful,"The pier was really nice. Food and bike rental was expensive. But we had good food. The cafe between Santa Monica and Venice had really good food. But 11.00 for 3 tacos, pizza was cheaper I think around 10.00 but it feed 3 kids. Drinks are pricey but you can get a large ice water for $1.00.Bikes were 10.00 an hour.Entertainers were cool. Clean and fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sydneyb34
30,Worthwhile to take a stroll and go,"It's a crowded place with all kinds of 'tourists'/visitors, and has a very touristy/commercial feel.The construction of the pier is quite spectacular, and is worth the visit, but the cheesy atmosphere, commercial attractions and fastfood kind of restaurants don't make it a place where I want to hang out more than an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OlivierFromBrussels
30,Bit of tat,This pier is a mixture of arcade style rides/games and tat shops selling you the standard tourist stuff. I suppose it is one of the things to do while in Santa Monica but from our point of view it wasn't anything special,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/24lyndsayf
20,Longtime dream dashed by a thief,"East Coast girl visits the iconic Santa Monica Pier (her longing built upon memories of the movie ""Lost Boys"") only to experience extreme disappointment by a thief, surging crowds of tourists and a shouting crazy lady who probably could use a medication adjustment. Had a great Pier Burger so it wasn't a complete loss. Skip the Pier and head south to Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jencolvin
40,Fun but bring a sweater,"This was second time visiting Santa Monica Pier, I thoroughly enjoyed myself both times. Rides are good, if you have small children they will love it. I have a 17yr old so she is a thrill rider so we could a couple and that was enough for her. She liked the people watching and of course the snacks on the boardwalk.It's on pier so it can get cool so bring sweater or sweatshirt. We visited in June and it was still cool even on the hot summer day. So be prepared especially with little ones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rochellenkevinv
50,Great attraction,We visited in May on the Monday of memorial weekend. The pier was very busy but this just added to the attraction. There's plenty of places to eat drink and visit. The street entertainers are excellent. Plenty of police so you feelsafe as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ianbb8
40,Family and friends...fun in the sun!,A great outing for young and not so young. Places for fun at the fair with shopping stalls..cafés...ice cream and more. Boardwalk is very exposed to elements so be sure to have hats and sunscreen and lotsa water with you. Beach is big with super soft beach sand...no pebbles. Close to 3rd Str Promenade and Santa Monica Plaza.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tereza09
50,Great spot to visit,"Was really cool to finally walk the pier, lots of performers and people on the pier. Was busy with tourists but not overwhelming. We were able to shop and watch some performers comfortably without getting crowded. Ate ate bubba gump (see review) and had a great time checking out the old school arcade",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/supraracer
50,Very enjoyable,"A must see if you're in Santa Monica. Beautiful beach and views. Fun place if you have kids, there are games, rides, and plenty of places to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Extraordinary652235
50,Always fun to visit,"Look, the rides aren't anything special but the pier is outstanding and the gondola high above the beach is a terrific view. It's a must see if you've never been and always beautiful to come back to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BReal549
30,Everything is overpriced,While it is a sight to see I felt like everything was overpriced. It cost eight dollars to ride one ride. Which makes no sense considering the rides pretty mediocre. The games were at least easy to when it works super expensive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/720jacquelynw
50,Wonderful!,"We were so glad that we stopped here. It was nostalgic to see. We loved seeing all the people, rides, and activities with the backdrop of the beautiful water. This place was a total California experience for us. There are plenty of restaurants so that you can grab lunch. This was a nice way to spend the afternoon with my family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ATXGirlie
30,Good for families,"There are good rides for kids, and overall a pleasant stroll by the water, with many options for food and drinks, peppered with some street artists.If one is in the area, its a nice detour, especially if the weather is nice....I don't see it as a major or must see LA attraction (actually Santa Monica....), but if combined with other places in the area, like the promenade, it can fill up a day by the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ronwol
50,American Classic,"Stop by and meet the world with the non stop parade of electic tourists. Bring small bills to tip entertainers or others will guilt you if you stop and enjoy the music and fun. Santa Monica Police are helpful, friendly while remaining viligent, and guard your back. Be sure to spend time watching the rolling ocean waves. Worth at least several hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/764charleyg
50,A nice stop,"My husband and I stopped here. We were in walking distance from our hotel.It's a great place to walk around. You can people watch, see street performers, shop, ride the ferris wheel. If you walk all the way to the end of the pier there is a mexican restaurant with great views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melisx33
40,Great Fun on Sunday afternoon / evening,"While in Burbank visiting Universal Studios with kids and grandkids, we decided to visit nearby Santa Monica Pier. It was great fun and a good place to ""people watch"". It was fairly crowded and very lively. We had an early dinner at Mariasol Mexican Restaurant at the end of the pier. Our grandkids enjoyed watching the few sailboats and all the folks fishing off the pier. The adults enjoyed the coastal scenery. It was quite windy off the Pacific and slightly chilly even for early June. Take a light wrap if you go in the afternoon / evening! Our only complaint was that we got ripped off on parking. We didn’t know there was parking on the beach below the pier (I think $12) and we had already parked at a private parking lot up in the city about 2 blocks from the pier for $25!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaroonDawg67
50,Great family treat,"You have to see this, the beach is really nice, the pier has lots of fun rides/things for kids, some of the street artists are excellent (some are terrible but it's still part of the atmosphere). Nice restaurants and parks in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaszloP381

40,A Great Place To People Watch!,"Lots of activity on the pier and lots of things to do, including eating snacks and riding amusement rides. One thing we noticed that was new this year were the artists that draw people's names as pieces of art. We bought one for our granddaughter - all three of us watched her create it. Fascinating. And reasonably priced at $1 per letter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teachers55
50,Had a good time,"Hung out here for a couple of hours with a walk along the pier, a cocktail at the bar/restaurant at the end of the pier. Then took a wander by the beach, great for people watching. Strolled along to Venice beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuzD2013
50,"A quite, family, and couple getaway . . . and walking distance to everything . . .","I had decided to visit Santa Monica on a cuff, enroute to San Francisco; but, I am very glad that I had taken the time to stop by . . . aside for both Venice and Santa Monica being a walking city/cities, I had managed to explore the intimate dining places, and walk along the beach. The Pier's Amusement Park and the people were an extra bonus. It is a place to go if you are looking to just cruise around, and take one's time to just enjoy the comforts without any rush . . .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidbE6543HD
40,Fun for families,Very crowded but the kids loved Pacific Park and their rides. Felt kind of run down overall and a bit dirty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndreaMSU

50,End of Route 66 trail,"If you are visiting LA , this is definitely a place to be. This pier has its own geographic importance as being the end of trail for Historic US route 66. The pier hosts a beautiful amusement park as well as lots of options for foodies. A great place to spend your afternoon, you can enjoy various street performances. People also come for fishing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thesrivastavaji
50,Absolutely great day,"Absolutely fun place to spend the day, nothing beats Santa Monica pier. Old world conditions and historical attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sledhead36
40,Exactly what I expected,We drove on a Saturday and all the car parks were full at $10 or $12. We found a short term car park just down the steps to the right of the pier which is $1 per hr - you can stay for a max of 2 hrs which was all we needed to visit the pier & beach as we were so close to the pier. I thought this was much more family orientated than Venice Beach. Loved the candy floss & popcorn on the pier. Well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rowsh
40,Cute little pier,"Take a stroll down this pier and see the souvenir shops, the artists selling items, and a few people feeding the birds (even when there are signs not to). There even was a place to try using a trapeze. When you are at the end of the pier looking out at the ocean, the nearby rides are not too loud. You can just stand at the end and watch the ships, birds, and the long beach. Don't miss the signs explaining the piers history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sue2000
20,Trashy,"I had such high expectations for this place. I thought it would have some great shops and restaurants with a decent crowd. I was so wrong. There were homeless drug addicts fighting (nothing against someone with an addiction or anyone who is homeless, just not what I pictured), incredibly trashy shops (and only a small amount) and horrible selection of food. It was the worst part of my trip to the west coast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gagirlinpc
40,Good for a wander,Good for a walk along - would be fun with children. The restaurants and bars are good too! Fun fun fun!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/westcountryphoto
20,Bit of a let down,"This place is full of crazy people trying to sell you stuff, the pier is a poor version of Brightons pier. I wouldn't go here again, go to Venice beach, it's much nicer (and less touristy).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/141gurmukhp
50,Nice change of scenery,We caught an Uber from Downtown LA to Santa Monica. It was beautiful. Definitely an attraction to be seen. Friendly people. Entertaining crowd. Perfect ocean views. Wish I could have hung out there all day. Even the restrooms were decent. Nice shops just up a few blocks as well. We caught the metro rail back to downtown.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shomarionline
50,A must visit when La,This is a must place. The vibe on the pier is great and there are some very talented artists and some not so much. Great views of the Pacific Ocean and some of the coastline. We played the Zoltar fortune teller which was made famous by Tom Hanks in the film Big that was fun,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chopprrrrreid
30,Good walk and the end of route 66,Good pier lots going on but when we went it was really busy and the weather wasn't great. We live in a seaside town in the UK and it felt a bit like flying for 11 hours to arrive in Weston Super Mare.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lringphoto
30,Ok,"Spent half a day in Santa Monica. We walked along the beach and went to the pier. Sort of strange having a carnival on a pier. It was packed with people. We much preferred to walk along the beach. A word of caution for those with children. If you head toward the skate park you will see shops that sell ""medicinal"" Marijuana. I personally headed the opposite direction with my children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeverlyC305
50,Great classic Oceanfront pier,Always love to visit the pier on my trips to Santa Monica. Fun visiting the amusement park and shops.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stuarts813
50,Fun day out,We really enjoyed the pier and the beach with lots of rides for all ages alongside a fairground traditional American feel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pathfinder683720
20,Overrated and busy,Was super busy and super dirty so I wouldn't go back again or believe my friends recommendations again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/321nataliev
50,This is a must visit,"When you're in the Santa Monica area, no visit is complete without spending just abbot of time walking the pier to the end. From the music being played, to the vendors, the fishermen at the end of the pier, and all of the people watching!This is a great landmark for the area. If you're heading there, you have to stop at the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F2069VYrobertg
40,Fun,Pity spent only a day.. would have loved to hang around longer...Cycling was great fun with the family.. too short to have enjoyed more,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/almas24hirani
50,A must do at least once,You are never too old for the Ferris Wheel. We enjoyed the view and the summer fair experience of the Pier. It can get crowded at times and tickets to the rides are not cheap. 3 people on the Ferris Wheel came to about $27But it was worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdandMia
40,Lively Pier,"The Pier was smaller than I expected, but definitely a place to experience! It's crowded all day and into the night. There are a bunch of restaurants, food stalls, souvenir shops, street entertainers, etc. to keep the place busy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/621fs
30,"Not the Greatest ""Must See"" Experience","Everybody has to see the Pier..right? OK...you see the famous sign and then, walk through a crush of people, street entertainers, mediocre food, etc. to enjoy the experience.See the Route 66 sign, walk around...and then beat feet off the pier and go somewhere along the paved sidewalk to eat.Glad I did it...but won't be returning again.Thanks",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/581carlv
50,Fun on the Pier.,"Santa Monica Pier is a great place to have fun. There is rides such as the Ferris wheel, roller coaster, etc. There are a lot of gift shops so you can get something to remember your trip. There is a Bubba Gumps and other restaurants there to feed you and keep you going. It is a must but only if you want to have fun. :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KYPU
40,Very cool pier and some rides!!,I took my 16yrs daughter to see the pier and we had a great time! We rode some ride and eat some food. Took pic of Route 66 sign and watched people on the beach. The day we went was overcast and about 66 outside. We walked all the way down to the end and eat lunch. Parking for the beach is $12 per car per day and public parking is around the area from anywhere $10-40 per 8hours. Most garages close at 11pm and if you miss getting your car then you have to come back in the morning. Beware that there is a lot of traffic on the weekends and police have zero tolerance for any foolishness!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roberthT3130FP
30,LA,"We stayed right on the beach when we dropped into LA recently - the pier was opposite our hotel. Its a strange pier in the fact that you can drive down it - and there is a small amusement park on it. The main feeling I had is that its a bit run down and grubby! Like most of my LA trip, it was good to see - but I wouldn't have been too disappointed had I not seen it. The one thing about LA that surprised me was the homeless problem they seem to have.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidF222
40,Short Walk on a Long Pier,"I took a coach tour through Los Angeles, in 2007. Karl, the driver, stopped briefly in Santa Monica so riders could stretch their legs. I walked up & down the pier that I had seen in so many movies. Scenes of Baywatch & other shows ran through my head. I paddled in the water then sat on the grass to let my feet dry before donning my socks. I will always be grateful to Karl for that little side trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunshineA21
50,Loved this place,Totally awesome! Good atmosphere and beautiful landscape.For all family! Many entertainment options.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndreaGusmao
40,Relax and take a break,Wonderful little seaside park to relax and enjoy the views. And the pier is full of interesting and exciting attractions. We love the merry-go-round which has a biorhythm machine on the side. For $1 you can find out why you are so happy or sad. Have you significant other use the machine and get insight into the rest of you day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SDwalkerSOCAL
50,The best way to end our vacation,"It was our last day before flying home, and our favorite part of the pier was the very tip...which was very relaxing. I wanted to try a hand at fishing, but enjoyed watching the other people fish. Straight after eating at Bubba Gump I decided not to get on the amusement rides my daughter got on the roller coaster.We would love to come here again, but we will try to stay at one of their hotels and come to the pier at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sandy_Salsa
50,A Fun relaxing day,"Had to see this for myself - seen so many movies and photos of the Pier ...Just awesome - Ate at Bubba Gump, love the white sand and tidy beach, took the walk down to Venice beach for a snack and a look see. Got a guy to take us back to Santa Monica Pier on is bike and seat thing :) One of the more relaxing days of my trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenbV42PM
40,Good fun!!,"This is a very lively place to visit. The entire area is festive including the beach, the pier and the surrounding area. Walking through the main streets is fun. As you reach the pier, if you are a total beach fan, it is good to take a dip in the water. Than you move up to the pier where you can enjoy all types of food and drinks, fun and games including a roller coaster and a ferris wheel. Good place to visit when visiting Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sainbasha
40,Great views and people watching,"Make time to spend walking the Santa Monic pier. It is the end of Route 66 so grab a photo of that. Walk to the end of the pier and then take more photos (or selfies) looking across to the beaches. Look at the performers, buy from the stall sellers, have an ice cream, grab a meal, and go for a ride or two at the amusement park. We were there on a long weekend so it was really busy, but this just gave it an amazing atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KdofMelb
20,Disappointed,"Didn't really enjoy Santa Monica pier at all, it looked tired and was rather tacky. The amount of homeless people nearby also didn't make feel too safe. I might be being unfair as I didn't really know what to expect and the weather was also cold and dull which may have skewed my perspective but I wouldn't visit it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/289hilarym
40,Might be better in summer,I think i was expecting more. Although a great spot i was a bit disappointed with the choice of places to sit and enjoy the pier. Still worth visiting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spanner2308
30,A photo opportunity,"We stopped as most people probably do because you see the pier in so many movies and tv shows. Along with the rides you see it has stalls, restaurants and buskers. It also has nice views of the beaches. You are on a pier so the surface is not flat but is ok if you watch your step.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PriscillaK93
50,Excellent people watching,"This place is crowded and crazy and interestng. Great views, a few restaurants and some wonderfully tacky souvenir shops. Not to be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/campmarengo
50,Fun way to spend a couple of hours,"Rides, drinks, food, sun, sea and fabulous views.We went on the big wheel, we could see for miles, malibu in one direction and Venice beach in the other and direct ahead views of Santa Monica and LA. Fabulous.Nothing more to say.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/calamitycastle
30,A good place to visit,"Hint: park at Parking Structure 7 in town and walk down to the pier; free parking for the first 90 minutes at that parking structure.There is not much to say about this pier - the rides in the amusement park are packed too closely, and there are the usual food stalls and tourist gift shops. Be prepared for a large crowd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nuboy
40,Convenient and relaxing,"The place is easy to reach with convenience parking space around. Spending time can be 30mins to 2hrs depends how much you would like to achieve.ExperienceHad a 1hr walk and was quite pleasant. Although shops are a bit touristy, which is totally understandable, the busking around did enhance the walk experience. A lot of birds flying around.The ViewView is great and very wide- able to see both sides of the coast line. Just one minor point - the beach wasnt too clean, found quite an amount of trash along the waves. Yet also spotted a cleaner so believe they are trying to fix this i hope :)? Besides, Theres a sign of ""end of route 66"" so its quite special too.FeeDidnt spend any but the shops around are not too rip offFits family/ friends/ just chilling",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/giligulu2016
50,fun fun fun,went here with my wife. first time in California. we loved it! so much to see and explore. we will come back soon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cnovs14
40,Iconic tourist attraction,"A must see if you're in the area. Iconic tourist destination. Fair type rides, food, great ocean views and the ""end of the road"" on the iconic Route 66! Rides and food are a bit pricey, but it's what you would expect for a tourist spot. We rode a couple of rides, ate pizza, walked around the pier and my daughter swam. She was the only one brave enough. The water was COLD, but it didn't stop her! A fun tourist spot to spend a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/621aimeef
30,"Crowded, but quaint","Visiting the Santa Monica Pier was on our list of ""must do's"" for our trip to LA. We visited on the Saturday of Memorial weekend, so not unexpectedly, it was very crowded. It is a quaint old pier, famous as being the end of old Route 66. It has spectacular views back towards the coast of the beach and coastal road. Well worth the experience, but moderate expectations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rotowhenua
40,You Can Say You Were There,"I've heard all about this iconic pier and finally I can say that I've been there. Went there with my teens and having seen the pier in photos and on the internet, I feel that there's nothing like being there. Although it was crowded, it gave the sense of importance and I didn't mind seeing people there with probably the same intentions I had as well. I enjoy the smell of food, especially the hot churros that are being sold there. People enjoying the rides, and the other attractions made me feel like I was part of history. Where I'm from, they don't have this kind of stuff so I guess it was something out of a book for me.The beach was interesting to walk in and the water was okay. Nothing like the beaches in Maui but that's hard to compare with anyway. ;)There are a lot of birds flying around and some looked like they were about to land on people. The worst thing about the Santa Monica Pier is the parking. Absolutely difficult to find any parking. We had to park up the street at a pay to park valet type of business. All in all, everyone enjoyed the visit to the pier. It definitely is something to go to so you can say you were there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MauiRanger
40,Great for kids and the whole family,"The pier is a great place for the whole family. Just be aware of the California coastal fog in June its call June Gloom. It could be cool before 12 noon. The afternoon is usuallysunny, but the fog roll back in the evening. September is the best month.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/985bibif
40,Why not,If you're in the neighborhood why not check it out. It feels how it looks but there were a few other unusual things too like a guy walking around with his live snake.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/polloRemuera
40,Fun place with friends,"This was my first time to Santa Monica and I gotta say I was impressed , it wasn't trashy I felt safe by far one of the best Piers I have been to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/205rayg
40,Entertaining,Lovely place to spend the dayCater to all agesLocation can find delicious hot dog 🌭The sands on the beach are very clean and the water is shallow and fine .Highly recommended for families to spend a full day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fedtnt
30,Average entertainment,Nothing special about this pier. Comparable to the ones in San Francisco and San Diego. It's worth a visit but I wouldn't go out if you way if you are debating other choices.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theGRAZfather
50,Great experience!,Found the Zoltar machine which was a blast from my past. Love the atmosphere. People of all ages looked to have a great time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/237JenniferS237

40,"Crowded, bright, great for picture taking","It's an amusement pier. Loud, crowded, the food is expensive and not great. BUT- you can get terrific pictures of the ocean, the neon, the rides and all sorts of things. You can take a picture with the Zolton fortune teller from Big.You can ride the ferris wheel and look out over the ocean and back at the city. You can look at all the people and think about how people have been coming out here from almost 100 years to hang out, fish, ride rides, eat treats and just enjoy being out. That and the cool photo ops made it all worth it. I would recommend eating before you come onto the pier though- lots of places just across the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReesS
40,Campy but fun.,"We always stop at the pier and ride the ferris wheel, which is a lot of fun and gives you a great view of Santa Monica and the Pacific. It's very touristy but we don't care. The food is mundane, especially given the great food on the mainland.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdventureBiker21

The whole place seems a bit run down and not very clean but it was packed with fun and food!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adventureamy1
30,Santa Monica pier,"We caught the trains from union station to get there, which was really easy to do. I was disappointed of the pier not as good as I thought it would be maybe the smog had something to do with it but I felt let down. We caught a bus to Venice beach then walked back to the pier. I thought Venice beach was discussing with the homeless people camped along the walkway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DayTrip709803

30,Iconic Pier,This is a very touristy pier. It is the western terminus of Route 66 . There are several restaurants and lots of vendors and entertainers. The people watching is fun. There was a seal in the harbor. Parking is $12 but handicap parking is free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancym616
40,An LA classic!,"I've been to Los Angeles a few times each year for my entire adult life. One thing that's still fun is visiting the Santa Monica pier.You get the sounds and smells of the ocean, some great people watching, and snacks!Great for friends, families, or couples. Oh, don't forget your camera!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blumphotography
30,Over rated and crowded,"It's ok to say you walked on it given the history, other than that, better carnival places to go to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffreyf844
40,Cross-country Trek,"After driving cross-country to San Diego my daughters and I decided to visit the Santa Monica Pier for a little Pokemon hunting. Coming from south Florida we were not prepared for the cultural differences. You hear about crazy traffic all the time but nothing prepares you for your one hour drive to be three and a half hours. If you plan on visiting the area and haven't done so before bring lots of patience, it will be needed.Parking was amazingly easy compared to the traffic. We found a nearby parking garage the first 90 minutes were free with an hourly rate after that about $2.Food trucks lined the streets, street art & performers, carnival rides, the beach and the sun. Pets are welcomed to the park and Pier, but keep in mind the area is full of bikes, roller bladders, skateboarders, and other pets. Our furry companion has issues with skateboards, thankfully he's a tiny dog. We carried him a large part of the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelabL1322GW
30,Old fashioned dated pier,"Good for the youngsters out for a night as not much really to do in Santa Monica. A dated old pier, not for me couldn't wait to leave. It's a hive of activity and very loud.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jannarshall
30,Touristy,Talented performers on the pier and around the area. I feel it's very crowded and there are chains like Bubba Gump which is not necessarily why I would come to the pier. However during Memorial Day weekend they did have a tribute to veterans which was amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/funfoodiefitness
20,So bummed,After hearing about this pier I was so excited but quickly felt super let down. Just so much hype for a dirty pier. I would never let my child on the roller coaster as it looks old and dangerous. Also parking is a nightmare. The parking attendant couldn't speak English very well so when we asked a question we have no clue what his response was. I guess we should be glad there was parking though it is $12. Glad I went to say I did but won't be back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/308jennab
20,Overly tourist-y,"Once in Santa Monica, well, you have to do it. But once there, and except if you are addicted to hyper-tourist-y places, you realize you are losing your time.

40,Tourist Trap,"Don't get me wrong, it's fun for the kids, great beach area, but it's a tourist trap. I've been there at least 20 times and it's always the same. Tons of field trips there, kids running around. However, as a traveler, you must take a ride on the ferris wheel at least once in your lifetime. The views are spectacular. Perfect spot for some great photos over the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/578LaurenM
40,Place must see,"Place muste see in Los Angeles, also Route 66 ends here today. Small amusement park located here. Good views to the beach and sea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mmikko
50,An Icon Worth Seeing,"If you are in the area, you simply MUST see the Pier! It is what you might expect, a bit crowded with lots going on. Live music everywhere and some really interesting people watching opportunities as well. The ""rides"" are, well, a bit lame, but so what? The food eateries leave a bit to be desired but there are some really great places a short walk from the pier. Cheap souvenir ""kiosks"" abound, but again, there is better shopping a short walk into town. Have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/607jayb
50,a walk up and down the pier,What a lovely day and place was packed and also looking from the pier the beach was packed too lots to see as things going on all the time well worth a visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/981davej

50,Final Destination,"As a joke my son told me he wanted to go to California for spring break. As we live in South Carolina he never thought I would say yes. We packed a Mini Cooper and headed west. His goal was to get to the Santa monica Pier and put his foot in the ocean. Well we made it, and he loved it. As we walked out on the pier I could see he was crying, I asked him why and he said that he was so happy he could not believe we were here. It was a trip we will never forget.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smarcle
50,Great tourist stop,"This is a cool place to stop if your in the area. It's like a mini amusement park on a pier. There are rides, independent ""street"" shows, fair style food, and restaurants...not to mention the amazing Pacific Ocean view. Beware of the ""watch/bracelet scammers"", they ask if you know what time it is, then put a bracelet on your wrist and ask for payment.Other than that though, it's a great stop for families.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzannedq
30,Burst my bubble,"After seeing it in the movies, I expected it to be a beautiful scenic pier. Unfortunately, its the usual tourist rubbish with overpriced eateries.

30,Eh,"I mean, if you're IN Santa Monica for the first time it's worth a visit, but it's kind of lame and rough around the edges. Also, we went on the ferris wheel and had to flag them down to let us off because the operators were pretty inattentive would run it really fast and jerk it to a stop. Mostly though, I felt like I was going to get mugged the whole time. Great sunset view, though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/camellia10
50,Really clean beach area,"Visited the Santa Monica pier today, love how it is accessible from the red metro line to the blue expo line drops you off a mere 5 to 10 min walk right to the pier, from the Hollywood area. Water is pretty close to the pier entrance compared to the Venice Beach area which is quite far from the ocean front. There is a walkway you can take from the Santa Monica pier to Venice Beach area, it is quite a jaunt takes about 45 min to walk here. You can rent bikes to peddle there, which would be a better idea. Souvenirs and food are cheeper in the Venice Beach area, pizza and pop combo for 3.99 was great and pretty tasty as well. Overall for cleanliness and safety I would suggest Santa Monica area, if your looking for more of the beachfront atmosphere and are with a group of people I would suggest the Venice area, a lot of starving artists in this area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mickeymousemobile

40,Finally made it to the Pier!!,"Having seen this pier and the infamous ferries wheel on so many TV shows and movies I was glad I could finally visit it in person. While some may consider this a tacky tourist stop, others may enjoy the nostalgia I experienced including the views from the pier of the surrounding area. The pier offers a few spots to eat and grab a drink including endless souvenir possibilities. Make sure you spend sometime watching the fishermen at the end of the pier as they try their luck. You may also see a large friendly pelican strolling along the pier, a great photo op for those who dare to get close.Give yourself about an hour or so for a quick visit before you head to Venice beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TorontoJourneyman
40,Honeymoon,"We stayed nearby and made several trips to the pier. During the week it is a wonderful, quaint place with lots of fun vendors, shops and restaurants. During the weekend? Well...

The usual tourist shops full of the usual chachkies and trinkets, a few rides for the kids, but not tons of families present. There were some interesting characters and street performers who apparently take up residence on the pier. The pier is historic and iconic, so worth a stroll up and down if you are visiting the area, and the Mexican restaurant at the end of the pier, Mariasol, was surprisingly excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AFamilyAdventurer
50,Great Fun!,This pier is fun day or night. It does light up so pretty at nighttime and there is great carnival fun too. There are also a few restaurants to eat at if your work up an appetite or just want to stop for a bite ocean side. Date night or with the family you must go!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/surgteck05
30,Wsymbol of the city,"The pier , the end of road 66 , the sea shore , all in one spot that gives it the attention, the visitors and some ambiance too .Yes, all visitors must visit and say they have been there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jehudam2017
30,Overrated,"I wanted to love it. The ocean and beach were beautiful. The shops were hokey but you expect that from a tourist trap. The musicians playing on the pier were quite good. The pier looks a little run down though and the rides look like death traps. One thing to make me feel like this pier is not amazing was when we were walking the pier in the morning, police were fighting with this guy trying to handcuff him. I know this can happen anywhere for sure, but I found it quite off-putting. The food was carnival type food. I just expected more overall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingwithJeff
50,Funfair fun,"We visited the pier on our trip to Santa Monica pier, and got in using our LA go cards, which are such good value for money and I would highly recommend them. The pier itself has some nice places to eat and drink, and live music to watch when we were there.In terms of the fair itself, it is a good day out for couples, families, and groups of friends. There are a number of attractions suitable for all different kinds of rider, so there is something for everyone. It was such good fun, and lovely surroundings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/295lob
40,Fun,The pier is really nice. There is a small amusement park on it where you can have fun. Nothing fancy but just regular staff. Quite a popular place for a sun set watching.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/965micha_d
40,Once in a lifetime....,"It was a first time visit... a good visit. Lots of people, busy busy busy. After paying $12 for parking, we strolled around the pier and doing the touristy things. Great walk, nice ocean breeze on a hot sunny day. Splurge $33 on the ferris wheel ride for 4 which creates a memory of a lifetime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mjbcmjbc
50,Fun,Ride the ferriis wheel eat funnel cakes at night right on the beach! The beach is great for people watching and enjoying every moment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shottzy1234
30,Usual tourist trap,"We made a special trip to ride the Ferris wheel only to get there and find out Pacific Park was closed to the public due to a private event! I talked to the security people and told them we came from all the way from Indiana and wanted to ride it and asked if I could talk to management to let us in to only ride that and was directed to a place that was gated and locked. Super ticked AND disappointed! The Pier itself has the usual tourist gift shops. A few restaurants and food carts scattered here and there. What was nice tho was after going down stairs, there was a planking walkway to the beach. This keeps your shoes from getting all sandy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EpicSpirit11
40,California Landmark in a Foggy Day,"We were very unlucky to visit on a terribly foggy day and were not able to see the waters of the Pacific Ocean. It was extremely cold as well. But this is a CA landmark that we have seen on so many TV shows and movies so we did not regret making the trip from Hollywood, CA to Santa Monica Pier. We walked around for a bit, took pictures at the Pier, and ate some Mexican food. We will definitely be back the next time we visit LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/516wilmar
50,Fun in the sun,We visited the pier on Mother's Day for brunch. The pier is a fun place to visit with several restaurants. Most of the restaurants are seafood type places and the food is always fresh caught. We enjoy the beach scene and the pier and make it a place we frequent when we visit Santa Monica.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RickDunlop
30,Just ok,"It's a hefty stroll out to the end for a nice view of the ocean, but honestly we enjoyed seeing this famed pier better from the beach! It was crowed and the street vendors hassle you--in addition to playing very loud, obnoxious boom box music. I suppose if you have children they may enjoy the amusement rides, but bring plenty of money for that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SherryF461
40,Great afternoon,We had spent the afternoon on the beach which was great. Busy but very clean and the waves were great but a little cold.Had a wander along the pier. It was nice but reminded me of a pier in the northwest of England with better weather.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V7835JCbenp
40,People watching at its best!,"Cool place to visit and check out the view. There are quite a few food places to choose from as well as souvenir stores. The people watching is one of the best parts of visiting here. Check out the sunset from the end of the pier if you can, makes for great pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeachbumJon
20,Expensive and crowded!,Go if you want to say you've been there. Over priced $8.50 for one ride per person. $14 for a burger. Not worth the price at all! Crowded and pricey! Parking was pricey as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/916stacieg
30,Very nice beach,"Visited the Pier as one should when in LA and it looks like it is on its last legs (unless they want it to look like that).Nice to visit though and have a look and I must say the beach along Santa Monica is excellent, miles of sandy beach and very well maintained.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/momayet
30,Pier in Santa Monica,"Some would describe this pier as world famous, as a U.K. resident, I've seen a few piers in my time.....it's nothing special. Forest Gump had the right idea, he ran to the end, turned around and ran off again. On a serious note, the pier is on a stunning beach, has a few fair ground rides and places to eat/drink. Worth a visit, but I would be surprised if you were there longer than an hour if not eating or drinking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MP-KJM
50,Don't miss it if your in LA,"Santa Monica Pier is world famous and its worth getting out there if you're in LA. There are great views of Malibu out to the right/North and Venice beach on the left/South and nice surf (one of the locals said watch out for sharks but there were plenty of swimmers the day we visited). 3rd St Promenade is within walking distance for plenty of shopping and restaurant options. You can walk from here to Venice beach as well. The Pier itself is abuzz with activity including musical performers, heaps of tourists and locals, fisherman, shops and Pacific Park (a kids theme park with rides and activities). There is a coffee shop (Coffee Bean) for the coffee lovers. And photo opportunities galore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldTravla7
30,Not a lot happening,"If you want piece and quiet, then a good place to go. The funfair was not operating that day. Nothing seems to happen until lunch time when the eateries open. I would have thought lost trade for them.Interesting to see the end of Route 66 sign as we had been on parts before.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JM-Mebear

40,Nice but not Great,"Went for along walk from Venice to the pier at Santa Monica. The pier was as expected and worth a visit but not amazing in any shape or form. Great to kill a couple of hours and tick the""been there "" box",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Oscarwildetime
30,For children,Here with my 24&20year old daughters. More of a place to be with young children who may enjoy the rides. A couple of beach type shops and food vendors. Nothing to write home about.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/conanton
40,Great!!!,"What a fun place! There's the amusement park with rides and games. Then there's the pier with music, vendors. Such a fun vibe!! I parked at the short term parking, a few minutes walk from the pier. It's only 1$ an hour for a max of 2hours. But if you were to go back, I'm sure you can pay for another two hours ;). The cheapest place to park!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TalithaMM
50,Beautiful and fun!,We had a great time walking along the pier and playing the games. We walked to the end to take a picture with the End of Route 66 sign. Beautiful beach!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmandaS4200
50,Lots of entertainment options,We enjoyed our short visit to the pier. It was Friday night and the place was abuzz with people.There's so much entertainment options - both free and pay as you go. There's some shopping and plenty of eating and drinking options too.Beautiful views from the pier and the restaurantsThe night lights are gorgeousBusy place but worth the visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KPwhanau
40,"Take a walk, soak in the atmosphere, enjoy the view.","I had a wonderful time at the pier, the last stop of route 66. But there is no need to stay too long. We walked up and down, listened to some music and took some fun pictures. There was a lively atmosphere and the view was great. Afterwards I highly recommend strolling along Ocean Avenue for some fresh beach air.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whyitripped
40,Busy but Iconic a must,"Typical beach pier with rides, restaurants and tourist tat. But as it's the end of route 66 it must be done. Very busy but all the fun and excitement you could hope for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yogachef

50,This is a pier! Look at the ocean too!,"While the sights on the pier are fun with the rides, little booths, performers and variety of ages, sizes and demeanors of people, make sure to stop and remember why there is a pier! We spent an hour watching a seal surfing the waves right on the side of the pier by all the rides. No one else was even by us and the few who ventured over took a quick selfie and left. Maybe everyone else sees so many wave surfing seals that they are jaded. However, it was really fun for us and we were happy to experience it! Also interesting are the posters telling the piers history. We were very happy to slow down and enjoy the day on this vacation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Heatherjett
40,"Very crowded, but still beautiful","We were here on a Sunday evening and it was extremely crowded. I would still recommend going here, though. Great views from the end of the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidd98321
50,Walk at Santa Monica Pier,"We parked opposite Wyndham Hotel, public park nice and cheap 90 minutes was free. The walk to the Pier is about 10 minutes. The buskers and the entertainers were fantastic. Micheal the magician is recommended. We got there just at sundown and made it back in the dark. Great lights with the Ferris wheel all lit. Most recommended to all. Just keep the little ones close since the crowds can be intimidating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SingaporeJD
40,Fun to walk along and get ice cream; soooo crowded,Cool spot to walk along but it's so crowded and the buskers playing music are obnoxiously loud. Fun carnival food indulgences and souvenir shopping.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheDuchessofNewYork
40,"Great atmosphere, entertainment - good ( not great ) food","Caught the light rail from DTLA to Santa Monica and headed straight to the famous pier. A joy to behold as we approached, with the amusement park standing out , the sounds of street performers obvious and the beach holding all together. Not sure on the value of the rides although I thoroughly enjoyed the roller coaster. Some great musicians around different areas of the pier. Some cool stores to buy quirky souvenirs. Had the great Japanese hotdogs for lunch. Delicious.Came back for dinner. Disappointed some diners were already closed - was looking forward to ice cream but closed early. Many options were bit fast foody. Went for Gump in the end - was nice but would have liked better options. But great day nonetheless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markgM7625IR
40,Interesting indeed!,One of those must do's whilst in LA to say that you have been.Something for everyone from preachers on the pier to demonstration on the board walk to side show alley for the kids.Essentially it is just a beach though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smeaa

40,Go at an off-time,"I've been to piers in other cities and this one is very similar. It caters to tourists, has a lot of tacky shops and overpriced restaurants. I went on a Tuesday morning and it was a nice visit. It was busy but not packed. I enjoyed the sun, the musicians and didn't buy a thing. I can see this being very fun for a family or someone who has never been to a pier before. It was a great walk and a gorgeous day. I have no complaints.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paseando
30,Simple!,"Nothing impressive here- just a couple of rides and the pier. If you are around the area go for a stroll. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend you to plan this as one of your tourist activities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eloygm
40,Famous landmark visit,The Pier has a carnival atmosphere. Lots of people having fun and some unusual ones busking. Plenty of Tourist shops. There's a restaurant right on the end (Mexican) where we had lunch and recommend it. There's numerous other places to eat too from fast food style to more restaurant style.You can also drive down onto the Pier and park on the Pier. Don't know if it cost.There's a 100 year old Carousel at the beginning of the Pier too which is inside a building.Has a great vibe and of course there's the mini theme park out there too. Great place to go.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skigirlGoldCoast
30,Pretty standard CA beach pier,"If you've done a CA pier, you've pretty much done this one. There are some rides for children at the beach end. Tourist shops line one side with musicians playing for tips on the other. There are restaurants at the sea end with numerous fishermen. It is a fun place to stroll and people watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColinC835
30,Nothing Too Special...,This is neat to see once but honestly was not very impressed. It is just a large pier with okay food and vendors.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScubaShag408
50,A Group Effort,"We visited the pier as chaperons with a group of sixty high school students who were on their senior trip from Pennsylvania.

We spent several hours in the area and everyone had a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnmZ1587EI

40,Great fun,Don't go on a weekend or Friday afternoon! It's bedlam! Sort of Brighton Palace Pier on steroids. West Coast Coney island. People are fairly fit and beautiful though. Great for photographers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N5900XOkeithm

30,Very busy! Not much room to move!,"As much of an interesting attraction the Santa Monica Pier is, it can get very busy which makes it seem crowded.

40,Fun but a little cheesy,"This place is about what you'd expect: a little kitschy, a little trashy, a little classic Americana -- but generally fun. Rides, food, a little bit of shopping, an aquarium, the beach...what's not to like? There's no shade, so wear sunscreen and take a hat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/859cathyw
40,Fun for all,"We are locals and have been coming here for more than 10 years. It is what everyone else said; carnival, tourist trap, etc. but it's also fun especially with smaller children.We had our twins birthday party at the enclosed carousel. Used to meet our friends from the valley every spring break and kids would play and ride until the passed out.In addition to the amusement park, we love the carousel and the small touch aquarium underneath. At the pier there is fishing, watch the surfers, and people watch in general. Awesome on a clear night when the park is ablaze with lights. At night you can grab a bite or beer and hear liver music as well.Parking can be pretty bad in peak season or if there is an event on the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rod1701
40,Always a fun place to go to.,"We loved visitng the Santa Monica Pier. Great views of the ocean, fun at the rides. It's also easy to find a place to at.

30,Quick weekend/weekday getaway for beach lovers,"On a weekday, my friends and I drove to Santa Monica Beach and it just took us 20-minute to get there but I doubt it on a weekend, the traffic might be crazy. We enjoyed walking on the boardwalk, taking picture, browsing some souvenir shops, while chatting. For beach lovers, it could be a nice place to surf, stroll or spread you beach towel and get a tan. But since it's a tourist area, it's a little bit crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelwithzen
40,Nice tourist trap,"Obviously tourist shops, but was clean and nice. Couple homeless wandering around living under the pier, but that's LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z5198HQrobertp
40,Fun evening,"The pier is worth a visit. We were there on a cool misty night so it wasn't very busy. Lots of restaurants and shopping nearby.

10,Gross,"Not worth seeing. The amount of homeless people is unreal. I had to step over their belongings on multiple occasions because they are strewn all over the walkways. There is no law enforcement, it really didn't feel safe. The pier is dirty and crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toniannb2014
40,Fun to walk around.,"We were pleasantly surprised at how clean the pier was. With so many people there we thought there might be trash, but the place was very clean. Plenty of people watching.

Was ok to say we had been there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/45rossite
50,Santa Monica Pier highlight is Big Dean's Ocean Front Cafe,"Santa Monica Pier is a must see at least once in your life. It is a fun place and has some old and very interesting game machines including the fortune telling heads! We have been there a few times and its always nice for a visit although the rides and food are not a big attraction. It's more the just being there, feeling the vibe and looking out on the beach which draws us back. But this visit we found something really worth telling you about: Big Dean's Ocean Front Cafe. It is not actually on the Pier but very very close, just a few steps away. This place is really great. The best burger I have eaten in the USA, very well priced and very lovely friendly staff. The kids had hotdogs and buffalo wings. Some in our group had their Double burgers. We were so impressed. We sat outside in very pleasant open area. The guy who served us heard our Aussie accents and went out of his way to recommend things we should do in Santa Monica. A lovely day at Santa Monica Pier and at Big Dean's.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KeriO_12
40,Seals and Dolphins,"We talk a walk along the promenade and were pleasantly surprised to find we could wander on and around the entire pier.A mass yoga session was in play with hundreds of participants near the shore, and as we wandered further out shapes in the sea became apparent and we were treated to not only seals but also a pod of dolphins....simply amazing.Sun was out so on we walked, we found the noisy buskers a little irritating and loud, they did not detract too much though.In the centre of the pier there is a small fun fair which whilst we didnt partake certainly looked like a great way to while away a couple of hours",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardUpshall
40,Nice enough but nothing special,"I have no idea what we were expecting, but what we saw was a nice enough pier, which was a little run down. A few little stalls and a few entainers (one amazing violin player) . Took all of an hour to do the rounds, was nice to see the end of the Route 66. Worth a trip just to say you've been.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrandMrsRC

Lots of police presence to help tourists feel safe. Beautiful at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahL200
50,"A tourist spot, but a great view.","We visited the pier just before sunset after eating and shopping nearby.

30,Iconic - But Don't Break a Leg Going,"I had such high hopes for the Pier - movies, music videos etc.However getting there - it's pretty run down and not at all well maintained.Visiting many other beaches and piers, such as Vancouver Granville, San Fran & Seattle - those happening Pier's are full of food choices and gorgeous views.Santa Monica is crowded and great for a young crowd - but the beach was SO DIRTY, trash everywhere and the surrounding buildings were run down.It definitely is a must to visit, just to check it out, and of course the classic Sunset photos - however if you don't have time for it, I wouldn't be too upset about it.UBER if you can, parking is atrocious!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sunjoyjoy

40,Great day at the Pier,"We got to the Piet about 10am reason because they said to get there early. Glad we did! We got there and parked right on the pier. For the whole day 15 but we only stayed a couple of hours and it was about $9. Everything opens up at 11am. We enjoyed the morning and walked all the way to the end of the pier. It wasn't crowded and just enjoyed the beautiful scenery. At 11am we ride the Ferris wheel,got a funnel cake and just sat and watched the crowds. We then decided to walk down to Venice Beach!!!! Don't go there. Very disturbing. Embarrassment to Venice Beach. We felt very unsafe, many homeless asking for money for drugs. Horrible!! If you want to rent bikes from Santa Monica pier and ride down there but don't get off your bikes. Come back to the pier. Fun day at Pier but sad and scared at Venice beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leecat123

40,Fun just walking along with the throngs.,"Took my hubby to Santa Monica pier as he had never been. We enjoyed just walking along the pier and people watching. There are of course a lot of tourist, but the locals are also very colorful. Does not take long to walk the length and you are at the end officially of US Rte 66! How cool is that? You may eat, drink and be merry as much or as little as you want.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MamanNY
40,Very fun!,"We visited on a Wednesday evening. It wasn't very busy which was nice. We rode the roller coaster. You get to go twice with one ticket. It was fun, but not a thrilling coaster at all. More like a fast train with a beautiful view. We also rode the Ferris wheel. It had an amazing view of the ocean.After the rides, we walked down the pier and watched the waves. We saw seals jumping in the waves. We saw fisherman which was cool as well. The sunset was amazing to see from here as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/813kristam
50,Fun day out,"A wonderful day out for all the family. Lots to do and see for the kids including rides, fishing, many eating places and ice-cream of course, tourist shops, local arts and crafts, musicians and much more.

50,Iconic MUST SEE in So Cal,"We visited at PRIME TIME...Saturday night.Parking is a nightmare, get down to the area BEFORE noon and expect to spend $20 on parking....at a parking garage. Walked the 3rd street promenade and enjoyed the shopping and street performers. Clean and safe.....Great Saturday afternoon experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/63brentt
40,A fun filled pier with great beach,"The Pier is a nice place full of attractions. The beach is great to walk and relax but crowded a bit. The pier has a park with rides for children and lot of eating joints and souvenirs shops. The best attraction for us is the Word Art vendors, they wrote your name or whatever you want in such beautiful manner that one gets really amazed. The beach and pier has ample parking space.One can find parking space in hotels outside the pier front too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mansi_Vij

In addition to that it also has the Pacific Park and several shops and restaurants lining the Pier where one can spend time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/901aayushk
40,Lovely pier,"Like the symbol of Santa Monica, pier is like top attraction. Fun park, many small shops and souvenir places. Street musicians, endless panoramic ocean view. a must see while in town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/qio_s
50,End of the Route.,This was the end to our most amazing Route 66 experience and it was not to disappoint. The sunset was something to behold and the pier is lively and vibrant. A great landmark and a walk to the end of the pier to look out over the ocean is a lifetime experience not to be missed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mjfoodlover
30,"Fun, But Not Historical Enough","Nice place to visit, but too many ""junk shops"" and chain restaurants. Needs something a little more polished to make it a destination for people without kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/929DavidK929
40,Great outdoor place,"It is a great place to take a walk, the view and beach is great, we saw some seals swimming nearby. The pier has all sorts of vendors, such as food and souvenirs, as well as kids attractions. The only downside is a number of homeless people just outside the pier. I understand that's the problem of LA in general, and there are more downtown, but I feel that something has to be done about it to attract more tourists and families with children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ikyselova
40,Fun!,"Hadn't been on a Pier like this since I was a child. How fun it is to walk around in the evening! Lots to see, great atmosphere. Good for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MapleandTango
30,Still worth a drive,"So...... we heard so much about this place that we decided to have a drive down to see for ourselves. Of course this still being L.A. we had to navigate the unavoidable L.A. traffic which took us about two hours from Anaheim because we were stuck in an accident which compounded our travel time.Anyway, we drove by the famous ""Venice Beach"" on our way to the pier. Once here, we were ferried into their parking lot which filled up with tourist pretty quickly. The parking lot itself is part of the pier and made out of wood.As we started out stroll along the pier you can see the beach for miles and bathers starting to gather for their ""tanning session."" The pier is dotted with concession stands as well as the usual ""street performers"" that you might see anywhere there are tourists.There is a small amusement section with a Ferris wheel and the usual stands for games. At the end of the pier you see others who go there for their daily walks to tourists taking pictures as proof that they were there. There is also a restaurant with spectacular views of the beach and ocean but they weren't open for the noon service.Overall, this small pier was a pleasant stop to wherever your headed for the day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Holdtheair
40,"Iconic pier, a must see.","We went there for an afternoon. The pier is a must see when in the area. The rides were high priced, but you must go on the Ferris wheel. We saw whales about 1000 yards off of beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SailSunJay

30,Fun,"My tween loved the pier. It was fun with some rides, a ferris wheel and bumper cars and others. There are some seedy characters walking around but definitely a family atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/702debp
40,Crowded & crazy but always beautiful,"We were here on a Fri afternoon after a business trip before heading back to snow in Denver. It was crazy crowded and we decided to eat just off the Pier instead of at the restaurants available there. We did drive right down & park on the Pier. It was an experience for my kids. There were probably cheaper options but getting there around 3pm on Fri there were plenty of spots. It is a max of $15 and I think we were there almost 3 hours on the Pier, Beach & eating near by so pricey but chalked it up to being tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/momof2wildchilds
50,fun day,Today is great out at the pier. It is a little windy but not over crowed. I never realized The famous Route 66 ended on the pier. Having a great day. The Carousel ride was cool and cheap at only 2 dollars for adults and 1 dollar for kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tcard2013
40,Great for Pokemon and more besides!,"Super views from this iconic pier. The games and rides are on the tacky side, just like any pier anywhere, but what a fun and cheerful place. Bubba Gump's had wonderful shrimp and seafood. Make sure to ride the Pacific Wheel just as the sun is setting,The pier is renowned for its Pokemon. We caught loads of rare ones and the jewel in the crown was a super-rare Typhlosion!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MerryH17
30,Nice view in sunset.,"I wouldn't say that the Santa Monica Pier is definitely fun to walk in in particular. I've only been here when it was dark and it feels like it was filled with kids, weird people and tourists. Although I would recommend to overview it in the sunset, then it's really beautiful. I would recommend to take a stroll by the beach and enjoy the view rather than be on the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebeckaJohansson
50,The end of Route 66,"This is the iconic pier you've seen in so many movies and TV shows. It's a nice attraction that allows you to walk on a timber board pier into the Pacific ocean. There's plenty of shops to buy your souvenirs. There's a sign on the pier announcing the end of Route 66. It was fun to get a picture under it. There are several nice bar restaurants on the pier along with some amusement park rides.We watched the sunset from the pier then enjoyed a nice dinner at Rusty’s Surf Ranch on the pier along with a pint or two of their red lager.We thoroughly enjoyed our time on the pier with it's history, view, and the surrounding beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dacz1

30,Packed,Our first time here and didn't expect such large crowds. The pier was packed to say the least! But it's an icon and must be walked. Enjoyed looking at it from afar especially at night. The solar paneled Ferris wheel is not to be missed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smileymamaw
50,Loved it,"We loved visiting the pier. We took the bus and it was very easy to get there. I would recommend going on Saturday morning when they have a farmers market going. It is a few streets above the pier. We just had the best fruit juice from a farmer. It is worth a try. The pier is beautiful and with a beautiful view to the ocean. A lot to see and experience. Loved the performers on the street, very entertaining...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/310priscillab
30,It was ok...nothing spectacular to see,"It was crowded, not that much shopping. If you like games and rides there was a good selection but nothing fantastic and I didn't even look at the prices. I wish there was more places to sit, maybe have a snack and look at the view. The best was at the end of the pier, there are stairs to sit and visit and have a snack.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kodajaz
50,Amazing place,"Had a fabulous day here! The beach and sea are beautiful and the Pier is full to bursting with eating places, rides, stalls and entertainers! Lots of seating areas to sit and enjoy so much activity or just to watch the sea and look at the amazing views!There was lots of car parking but we didn't use it so don't know how much it wasWell worth a visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharonreid66

50,Loved It!,"We loved this, and so did our daughter. OVERCROWDED though! It was SAT night, so I get it ... Parking was almost full, and so you know if you are not from L.A., traffic is always horrible! Regardless, you got to come here, it is a graet time, great views, great amenities, sky wheel, and all the typical stuff you'd expect. Pricey as all L.A. but hey, you live only once, right?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fborrull
20,Long Walk on a Short Pier,"Small amusement park on a crowded pier. If you like wall to wall people and touristy 'artists' doing caricatures, this is the place for you. The walk to the end of the pier and back takes about 15 minutes. Go visit the Getty or Griffith Observatory (with its view of LA and the Hollywood sign) instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobcX237AP
20,Urgh! Dreadful,What a horrible place this really is. Packed with street sellers and folks that are rude. Over priced and a total tourist trap. Seen it once and that is enough for me.Rides are rubbish and over priced along with all the shops on the pier,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bLaZeR666_uk
50,Must-do trap,"If you are staying in LA the pier is iconic and really a must-do. you won't need long there unless it is near sunset (the best time to go), but it is definitely worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattr6284
30,Too busy!,Too be honest as soon as I got on the pier I wanted to get off. It was CRAMMED with people... all tourists for sure. I don't think it is necessary going on the Pier when you visit Santa Monica. I much preferred the beach walkway down to Venice Beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kattherat
40,Lovely Day in Santa Monica,We spent our first day in California here wandering along the pier & shopping. The pier itself is not really my thing but the walk along the beachfront area was lovely. The sea air was fresh & the weather perfect which was exactly what I needed after a long flight from Australia. We had lunch at a little Mexican place & spent our afternoon shopping in the pedestrian mall several streets back from the waterfront. Nice place for a wander.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AWTYblogger
50,Legendary,"What can you say... it has it all.People watching, ferries wheels, flea market tables, etc.Pretty cool!A definite must!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnwP6477NF
40,Landmark pier,"The pier is a must see place but we were disappointed with the attractions on the pier. It was a little bit pensive for what it was, but is part of the go la card scheme which if pairing with other attractions on the same day make it a better value location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dazleech
20,Underwhelming,"There's nothing out of the ordinary here, and it's small. Don't see what all the fuss is about. Nice beach, but I would give it a miss.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yog-Sothoth
40,Pier was great,The Santa Monica pier was great well worth the visit. Great to see the wooden carousel. Beautiful relaxing day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoL607
20,Santa Monica Pier,Tacky and crowded. Not recommended if you wanted somewhere to relax and enjoy. Better walking along beachfront,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K7790VHgregk
50,Fun place and great sunset pics,Enjoyed our time at the pier and great shots of the beach and sunsets. Highly recommend. Very fun rides also and a good value with the GO card in LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wwm1006
50,Santa Moinca,"What a fun walking city. What's not to love walking along a beach- walk to Venice Beach, Muscle Beach ....Many great restaurants and shops. The Bus Tour offered provides you with a great way to visit Hollywood, LA and The Grove. The Pier area is clean and entertaining. Many good hotels with great locations. Easy drive to Malibu beach. The Grove and market are a must see .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JOJO816
40,Must See Location,"A must see location for any LA visit.Strange to see beaches so packed after our almost deserted beaches (by comparison) in Australia.We arrived at 6pm and stayed until 8pm. It meant we saw the beach/pier in daylight, the sunset and then after dark.We even bought some craft (name pictures) from one of the many sellers.My only criticism (or warning) is the traffic was absolutely terrible. It took what seemed like an eternity getting there and then leaving. Often only one or two cars making it through each change of lights. Worse when leaving at 8pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/931brendanq
40,Very tourist centred and pretty expensive,"We walked all the way up from Venice beach along the boardwalk and up to the pier. It was a lovely sunny day and we strolled fairly slowly for the 1.5miles. Once at the pier there is a lot to do but it's all for the day tripper, tourist or kids I reality so wasn't much of a sight for us. We stopped for a cup of tea and some water and was slightly out out by the $4-40 per bottle for a litre. It was busy as it was a sunny weekend, but everyone was in good spirits and it was fun to people watch...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peppermint
40,Fun to Walk on the Pier and See What's Going On,"We used to always come here in February, when the rides were closed and it was generally windy. Nine years since our last visit, we came in April - happened still to be a windy day, but the rides were active, shops were open and street performers were out. Enjoyed sitting at the end of the pier listening to a musician. There is a bar at the end where you can eat/ drink. The amusement rides are expensive, but might be a nice treat if you picked one (nobody wanted to join me on the ferris wheel). Steps at the beginning of the pier take you down to the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/858ClaireW
40,Nice amusement park and restaurants,"A fun area to visit. Fast food, good food, high end food. Typical beach shops, street artists. Small, but fun amusement park. Best view of up and down the coast. A must to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frugalarnie
40,Strolling the Santa Monica Pier,"We walked down from the Fairmont. A nice easy stroll with amazing views of the ocean, sunset and pier. The pier itself offers lots of opportunities to buy hats, shirts and bags. Food establishments are also plentiful. The rides and games are fun and entertaining. The ferris wheel and end of Route 66 sign are great spots to stop and take a commerative photo or two. Bubba Gumps is also nostalgic. You really only need two or three hours to do and see it all but we'll worth the walk, time and money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevinbX1218HN
40,Walked right to the end,"And loved it. Rides, food, stalls. Great people. Great vibe. Perfect views and photo opportunities. Iconic. Felt like I was in a video game 🎮",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spiceylulu

50,Beautiful Beach Attraction,Truly a gorgeous beach with miles of sand and a stunning mountain view. A large variety of restaurants and food vendors make it a very enjoyable afternoon destination.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cherylg641

30,Should see but nothing special,It is a landmark that you should see but there is really nothing there. If you have ever been to a local carnival you have seen it but it is iconic so worth the trip. Lines for rides are long...very crowded. We bought nothing but I am glad we saw it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pickymomboston
50,Beautiful and Fun Beach and Pier!,"Went for a short time on a layover, and although I've been before, I experienced it in a different way this time. Took a long walk on the trail (very well maintained and lots to see, be careful to look where you're going so you don't get run over by bikers), took a walk on the beach (beautiful, full waves, surfers), and walked the pier (fun people watching, rides and games, also pretty when you go to the end and climb to the higher observation area).The beach also offers various parks and even some benches for sitting! I took public transport so I'm not sure how parking is around the pier, and I'm sure it's super crowded at times, but it is a fun place to visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vicknjeff
40,Barry Island in LA,"This is an old pier with basic fair ground attractions but we had great fun.The Pier Burger was reasonable but the buns were sweet.Bubba Gumps is a family favourite but we always spend too much there.The sign for the end of Route 66 is a fun photo spot.The Ferris wheel and roller coaster were basic but fun.All-in-all a great place to spend an afternoon or evening, especially with teenage kids, including the one still inside you.We had great fun playing the old arcade games from the 80s and fuse ball got competitiveA $36 wrist band lets you ride everything from 1100 to 2300 - great value.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PriorReview
50,"Great energy, fun to people watch and see the sunset","This is my favorite spot in Santa Monica. Even if it is crowded, it is a lot of fun. I wanted to see the ""official end"" of Route 66 that is located right in the Pier. You can ride in the Carnival located in the Pier or just watch the musicians, and souvenir/artists stalls. Take an ice cream and walk to the end of the Pier to have a great view of the Sunset, people watch and see surfers in the Pacific Ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulistanaCA

50,A visit to Santa Monica isn't complete without checking out the Pier,"It may seem a little cheesy, but Santa Monica Pier is a great experience.

40,Fun for tourists,"Here from Chicago, we visited the pier on a Tuesday afternoon. It was pretty busy with locals and tourists. Food and rides are expensive, but the carnival style games are pretty reasonable. Too cold to be a beach day for us, but there is plenty of beach access with beautiful views of the ocean and mountains.We liked it here a lot, parking was very close and convenient.The pier is a bit trippy...meaning, there are lots of random nails and effects in the walking surface that present tripping hazards, so be careful where you walk and wear comfortable shoes (be careful in those heels y'all)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ajthejetsetter
50,Perfection,Words cannot describe this place. It is truly one of the most remarkable places in the worldA must see for all!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jordanz467
30,Buzzing but expensive rides,"The pier is alive with people, restaurants and the fun fair. Rides are expensive - $17 for two people to go on the big wheel. There are lots of people busking on the pier and those at the end were very good. Small shop to commemorate the traditional end of Route 66. You can park on the pier for $6 for a couple of hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5cruffy
40,Great for a wonder. Great view of the sunset.,"We wondered through the Pier both day and night on our recent visit to Santa Monica. We found it to be a hive of action.

20,OK as a short side trip from the beach,"If you are spending a day at the beach, spending a hour at the pier is OK. They have a few rides which expensive and not that much fun...but more oriented for the younger kids. A few carnival games and some food available as well. We expected more of Santa Cruz Beach and Boardwalk experience and so were a bit disappointed but if you are there for the beach, stopping by the pier is a good use on an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CalDP
20,Closes on forecast of rain rather than rain itself,"I stayed at a hotel in Santa Monica primarily to visit the attraction, but found that it closed earlier than I expected one night, and the next day with rain forecast they didn't bother to open.. which was unfortunate because it was bone dry until 2:30 pm. Most amusement parks I'm familiar with are kee open the food, games, and rides such as a Ferris Wheel going in a little rain, because the risk is more with rollercoasters. It was further disappointing because they didn't bother to note the closure on their web site... you had to physically go there to find out it was closed. Be wary if there is any rain in the forecast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pinman1
40,Family Adventure,Lots of fun to walk down and see the ocean. Very touristy but still a must do if in the area. Very windy and cold in the evening.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seirshalove727
40,Well worth visiting,"The pier is like a small carnival above the water. There is a little amusement area and there are singers all along the pier. A few nice resturants with many places to sit and people watch. Ride the ferris wheel if you get a chance, you will get a nice view of the pier and the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NNWSLARRY
20,Go once,"If you have never been to the pier you haveto see it. That said with the exception of the beautiful Pacific Ocean, the pier itself is loud, dirty and very crowded.Nothing pretty or interesting about this boardwalk. Just tacky souvenir shops, badrestaurants & tons of tourists.If you have kids, they may enjoy the ridesbut you'd better keep your eyes on them,it's really busy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephanierI7666VO

30,Under Monterey or SFO Piers,"Best for restaurants with fresh Crabs alive and great prices in the stores.Second SFO for the view, sealions, alcatraz view.Third faraway could be Santa Monica Pier. Many games to waste money, few eat options nothing worthy. The parking is a nightmare in holidays.And the traffic to arrive and leave from downtown LA is an addional nighmare (45-75 minutes).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rzccr
40,Typical crowded pier!,"No matter anybody's opinion, it is a must visit in Santa Monica.There is a short and long time parking. The long one is $12 per day.Typical pier with stalls and rides. It is a nice short walk anytime of the day.After you are done, you can cross the bridge and go to promenade ave where are the shops and street performers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/173hanyg
40,Fun!,"We had a great time here with our friends! Even though it is touristy, it is worth the stop! We went in the evening, and the colors and views are amazing! Nice view of the bay from the pier.

50,The Pier treated us GREAT,"This has been our third time coming back to this SM Pier. I so do recommend walking shoes, cash and a light jacket. Food is a bit pricy but well worth it. A must do in SM.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elly170
30,A Place To See and Be Seen,"If it weren't always such a zoo, I'd given the Santa Monica Pier a higher rating. But apparently it doesn't matter what time of day one goes there, the place is always jammed-packed with sightseers and tourists and the usual throngs of weird-looking and weirdly behaving people--with Fridays and weekends being the most unbelievably crowded days of the week.The Pier's huge ferris wheel is probably it's most noticeable feature or landmark, and at night it offers quite a spectacular light show that can be seen for miles up and down nearby Pacific Coast Highway or if you're in a boat several miles from the shore.The Pier offers a slew of other amusement park-like rides, lots of fast food joints to grab a quick meal, and the usual collection of street performers, artists, merchants, arts and crafts booths, a few indoor dining establishments, an arcade and sightseeing attractions that seem to defy description. But again, the problem with Santa Monica Pier are the crowds. Most of the time it's like a zoo!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcelproust37
20,Would not visit at night.,Found pier to be dirty and the children had no desire to ride anything at the pier. Had planned to eat there but nothing was appealing. Great for a quick visit and photo but full of buskers and people asking for money.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/belindacam
40,Busy but Fun Boardwalk over the Pacific,"We visited this famous tourist attraction on a Friday afternoon. It was busy, but you could still get around. Parking is about $12, so be prepared. Plenty of shops, restaurants, attractions including a small aquarium with hands-on pools. The beach here is huge. If you are coming from across town, bring your traffic patience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brothermoses
30,Santa Monica Pier,"This Pier is VERY popular with locals & tourists particularly at weekends.Great for families with young children ( say 5 to10 years old) with most rides aimed at this age group , older teenagers will find less to entertain them",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mr_Tony_R_C
50,Come early and buy an all day pass for the rides.,"My son wanted to ride the coaster here and he found it a blast. It is not Disney, but it is great fun for small to middle age kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidcW7208ZC

50,Great time!,"What a great time--we rode the Ferris wheel and got awesome selfies from the top with that amazing view. Also grabbed some delicious coffee and listened to all the street performers while taking in the view. It's the ultimate American/socal experience to me--the smell of funnel cake, the music, and families having a great time. Worth the trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/584megant
40,Had to see the Pacific,"Not technically the Pacific, but close enough. The pier is crowded. The beach was pretty nice. My favorite part of my visit was the town of Santa Monica itself.

40,Long and clean,"I walked from one end to the other, didn't see any rubbish, even smoking isn't allowed. The pier is historic with many rides for the young ones. It is full of little shops selling souvenirs and food also. There are a few mucin men sing or playing. Great place for a visit and a stroll around. It is also the end of Route 66.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gasman4124
50,one afternoon at the pier,"great place to hang out, nice restaurants, amazing view.Hidden secret - you can park your car at the pier or at the beach and it is cheaper than at nearby places.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sergiobV6825OA

Lots of street artists and very safe, as there is a police station/office right there! a must go place in santa monica!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Franco0311
40,Great Please to visit if you are in the area,"Great place to go around with nice shops and restaurants. I'd suggest to drive down to the beach and the Pier and get lost in the crown while enjoying street performers, buskers and whatnot. The city also has free available wifi which is something pretty nifty nowadays",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Curious401054
50,Beautiful Santa Monica,Santa Monica is amazing seaside town with a bustling pier! lots of shops for the shopper in you but you can take the Malibu star home tour from the pier and as the sun sets on the pier you can see Fisher men and have a meal in the amazing Bubba Shrimp from Forrest Gump starring Tom Hanks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/488annemariec

50,Beautiful,Love the live music at the end of the pier. Hang on to your small children. We did not do the rides but definitely plan on doing that next time. The parking was easy for us too.

50,Loads of fun!,"My husband and I visited (our second trip). You can spend all day on the pier. Great restaurants, games, rides. Fun for family or couples. Gorgeous views!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robintford
30,Good time!,It's your typical tourist place but if you enjoy that type of attraction it's fun to see and the views are wonderful. A walk along the beach is great and there are plenty of restaurants along the main drag. I do recommend the Ferris wheel to say 'you've been there' and the view is fantastic.. I had a good time!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Laurie1171
40,Neat to see,"If your in the area its a must stop. Overpriced vendors, but what else do you expect. View is great, parking plentiful",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellyn850

40,The Pier makes money😉,"Well, the attraction is really worked! Excellent location for a restaurant but fairly have to say that the meal is tasty, service is good and Pacific Ocean is just in front of.. So, they served quickly (not very but still), I tried really good prepared salmon.. Expensive. And that is the only one minus..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mar273
40,Fun in the Sun - Iconic Have-to-Visit Spot,If you are in Santa Monica you have to visit the pier. There are a few restaurants but it is mostly just a carnival atmosphere. Be prepared to walk up and down a fairly steep hill (or drive).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gayleb881
40,"Nice Beach, Nice Views, So-So Rides","Santa Monica Pier is nice to visit once. This was my second time with my teen son. I think the views are great, the weather is lovely, but the rides are overpriced and so-so. Really crowded on the Sunday I visited which was to be expected. So we went on two rides (roller coaster and ferris wheel...which cost about $36). If you plan to go on a lot of rides, get the all day wrist band. Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk much better. However, it was still fun despite the crowds. We enjoyed walking around the Santa Monica shops (3rd Street Promenade) better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DL9022
30,The people's pier,"Having seen photos of the famous pier over the years I had go and see it fir myself.There's lots to do and see, however nothing appealed to me. Walking back to the car the guys passed me and I overheard them saying ""this is like the poor mans Disneyland"".Well it doesn't claim to be anything but a pier with restaurants and amusement rides rather like you found in any city prior to theme parks being built.Being the weekend it was crowded. Walking to the end I couldn't wait to walk back and get away from the jostling crowds.Should you go if you've never been? Of course you should. Would you ever go back? No.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dizzyg33

40,Very pretty,We enjoyed going there and walking the famous pier. Parking is a pain is the butt. It's easier to find parking down the street along the tall palm trees and walk down. They have meters there but they are free after 6pm. Another must see and do for the Ca tourist! Go in the evening. You can get pictures of the sign at the entrance and then pictures of the pier at night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisnhso
50,Amazing Attraction,"Breathtaking views! What an experience. Shops, street vendors, arcade and a little theme park with roller coaster and farris wheel! Great beach views, good boat watching. A must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/712JMLeb
30,Just because it's famous,"The pier offers great views but on nice days is extremely crowded. The rides are anywhere from $8.50-$12 per ticket, so I caution you if you are tourists bringing your family. Plus the line to purchase tickets will be close to 30 minutes. You go here because it's famous not other reason.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ajenma

40,"Ok, not was exciting as I expected",The excitement here are the street performers and the tourist shops not the ocean. A few brave fishermen at the end of the pier. A handful of amusement rides and a big arcade. My kids we entertained for about 20 minutes. They liked walking on the beach more.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alicias655
40,"great walks, people watching, crowds but empty also",Amazing outdoors here: you find crowds but also can get away from them. Water is right next Plenty of eats. Even biking trails and rental bikes but then you have to watch where you are going because bikes share the lane with pedestrians.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/betteradvisor
50,Something for everyone!,The Pier has lots of fun restaurants to choose from for a variety of foods. The best time to go is at night so that you can enjoy the bright lights of the Ferris wheel and other amusement rides. Their are street entertainers to stop and listen to their instrumentals and/or singing. The area seemed very safe and was exceptionally clean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KellyL2365

40,Must see,"We got parking at one of the parking lots on the beach, just past the pier and it cost us $8 for the whole day. It was an easy walk from the car along the boardwalk on the beach to the pier. Tip - (there are stairs from the beach leading up to the pier). Santa Monica Pier is a very busy area with tourists, but not crowded on the week days. There are lots of photo opportunities and at the end of the pier you will find billboards with the history of the pier complete with historical pictures (for the history buff).Also you will find a restaurant where you can sit, eat and enjoy the view of the sea. There is an amusement park with a huge ferris wheel, and along one side of the pier is a carnival style atmosphere with lots of small booths selling trinkets and fast food. We spent about 1 to 2 hours roaming around, taking photos and enjoying the scenery. MUST SEE experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/norma_gordon

40,Had a great time,"Fortunately the weather was nice. We went on some of the rides, but they are not much of you compare them to other parks, but we still had a swell time on them.

30,Santa Monica Pier,Sadly this was a huge disappointment for us. We went in the evening so it was pretty with all the lights. But there are very few rides and they were expensive as you needed quite a lot for one ride for one person.There were a few stalls to shop which was the only nice thing.No place to really eat - think there was one restaurant?The public bathrooms were disgusting! Avoid at all costs!We expected more but it's not like what you expect when you see it in a movie!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Me8ow
30,Bday,The view is beautiful and entertainment was priceless. I did see a couple of homeless people lounging around which made it a bit uncomfortable so we didn't stay too long.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TiffanyC965
30,"Seen one pier, you seen them all.","Typical pier with souvenir shops, food stands, arcade and amusement park rides. Some of the performers on the pier are pretty good and very entertaining.

30,"What you would expect, rides expensive",It was a good enough place to visit. Lots going on with street performers and rides. We thought that the rides were quite expensive for what they were - there were big queues so we just didn't bother. But still worth wandering round as part of a trip to the beach/ boulevard.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Munchkin208
40,Great,"Loved the ice cream. Never realized this was the end of Route 66. Well placed entertainment along the pier, a great stroll along the boardwalk. Did not try the restaurant at the end of pier, but the location is incredible. Terrific photo opportunities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kamerade
50,Love!,"I loved Santa Monica! The pier was very cool, as well as the beach! There was a concert going on when I was there on a Friday night. But I will warn you- I payed like a million dollars in parking that night. I parked at a lot a ways down from the pier and then saw that it closed at sunset... I ended up parking in 4 different places in one night, it was a disaster. But that was my own fault. Overall, a great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abbygordon1994
40,Worth a visit,"We visited in the morning it gets busy, we loved the Bubba Gump store and the seat outside with the suitcase & chocolates, there are lots of photo opportunities, there's a sign where Route 66 ends. We wondered along the pier listening to all the entertainers and the children spent a bit of time on the amusements. There are a few seats to watch the world go by. The beach is clean with plenty of space, we would recommend a visit 4⭐️",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T5385DAmichellet
40,Good with LA Go Card,"We went to the small amusement park and had unlimited rides with our LA Go Card. Otherwise this would be too expensive. About $33pp for small rides. Definitely would not pay that for a family of 4. However once in, it was fun riding and looking at the ocean and beach. We did this in addition to a day of riding bikes along the ocean and hanging at the beach. After one ride on everything we left for dinner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wendyb282
30,Great touristy place to visit.,Nice view of the Pacific Ocean and pretty beach.The pier is the standard tourist trap with the expensive doodads and gift shops.The rides are expensive.We ate at Bubba Gumps in the pier and it was very good.This is a good place to stretch your legs and get outdoors. It is also cool to see the place that has been in so many movies and tv shows.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Losviera
40,Fun couple of hours,"The pier is at the western terminus of old route 66. There are lots of shops and places to eat as well as a small amusement park. I loveFerris wheels and this one was nice with a great view of Santa Monica beach and the rest of the pier from the top.

50,The Pier was our second home,We had a great time with the pier so close by. The rides are fun and it's fun to watch people on them. The carousel from the 20s is a must see.

30,Tacky,I suppose if you are in Santa Monica you have to visit the pier but it's not worth making a special trip to see it. Really tacky with cheap souvenirs and mediocre street performers. Seen it once but don't want to return.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lord_Brett_Sinclair
50,Fun way to spend the day,"Went to the pier and rode the rides all afternoon. Lines were fast and staff was very nice. Look for savings online before arriving to save some $. Prices as expected for ride bracelet and food. Kids had a blast and left exhausted. It can get windy being on the pier...even on nice days so layers, hat and sunscreen are a must. Photo is a view from ferris wheel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrandyR216
50,Excitement on every level,We really enjoyed the pier from its amusement park to the locals playing music on the guitar. There is even a man that has tamed birds to sit on you for a photo opportunity. Amazing. Must visit this spot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dkboyer2000

50,Santa Monica icon - make sure to visit!,"The pier is crowded, touristy and slightly tacky - but that's part of the appeal! It's an icon that is well worth the visit, even just to say you've been to the pier that is so often featured in movies and on TV. We enjoyed strolling along the pier during the day and evening - the Ferris wheel was great to ride after dark. Don't miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cab-80

20,Not what it used to be,"We did the obligatory stroll down the pier, it reminds me of the old traveling carnivals from the '70's, dirty, rundown and more than a little sketchy. No reason to hang out more than the hour we did. Would never venture there after dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1KirstenV
50,Santa Monica Pier,The Santa Monica Pier is an iconic landmark everyone must see at least once. There are many shops and restaurants to browse through while admiring the beauty and vibe of the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Voyager79756
20,Ehhh,"Too crowded. Dirty walkways. Plenty of homeless people walking around causing a scene. Plenty of parking here, not sure the cost. A few restaurants and souvenir shops. Plenty of benches. Nothing special to be honest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/133JohnH
40,Great day at an iconic Socal location,We were fortunate to catch some great November weather in southern California and wanted to spend a day at the beach for the first time. We were happy we decided to go to one of the most iconic Socal locations at the Santa Monica pier. We got there early and got a great parking spot in the parking lot next to the pier. Great atmosphere with classic carnival type food and gift shops. We also spent a good deal of time on the beach and in the ocean and enjoyed visiting the original muscle beach which is only a few steps away from the pier. Great family beach day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/334jasong
30,Really touristy,"Probably a place where you have to go, but once should do the job. The restaurants are not too appealing and the Pacific Park does not seem to be spectacular. And of course, everything's incredibly expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timgilbert09
50,A Dream!,"I have long wanted to visit the pier in Santa Monica, and it was absolutely the first place I went once in Los Angeles. Certainly one of the most beautiful and spectacular piers to visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelcooking
40,Cool Boardwalk,"Super-traditional, classic boardwalk. New restaurants are kind of taking over, but the feeling is still VERY Southern California with a breathtaking sunset opportunity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bromcd
40,Step back in time,"Spent half a day on the pier-lots to see including carousel, fairground, buskers etc. Lots of souvenir outlets, bars and food outlets-surprisingly good prices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PNE02031956
10,Coundn't get close to it.,We tried to drive to the pier on Sunday about 4pm. We were staying about 2 miles away. The traffic was at a stand sill and long lines to the parking lots. Parking lots near pier were blocked off. At this point the traffic was so bad we had a 40 min trip back to the hotel. We asked about visiting the pier before we left - they didn't give me a warning about the traffic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NinaJimBoone
40,Good spot to visit,This is one of the most popular spots in LA for tourists. If you go on a sunny day you'll really be rewarded with a nice view. While it's definitely nice to see there's not much to do around. I didn't go on any of the rides at the park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stanimirc2014
30,Fun visit but more geared towards family with small children,(Just to clarify we're an all adult family) we enjoyed our day however we went in late March very windy day and cold so we didn't get to enjoy any of the water activities it was a nice walk down the pier to see the sights and the shops . the amusement park is more geared towards families with small children or even young teenagers. We enjoyed venice beach more,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelpage82
50,Great to walk along,After a day shopping in Santa Monica we popped along the Pier to check it out. Very cool and you can see where the end of Route 66 finishes. Also a replica of the Zoltar fortune teller from the film BIG. Great fun for all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KirstyJay20
30,"Don't spend long, go to Venice Beach",It's nice to see due to its presence is movies and games. Though the actual park itself is like a C grade Carnival. Spent only 30 minutes here. Best thing was going right to the end away from the rides and just reminding yourself about how amazing it is to be in LA. I do recommend going down the road to the Skate Park and beach side shops 1km down the road at Venice beach. Really cool vibe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/604jaymec
40,Nice point for a short visit,"The pier is really nice. But i hope you have some luck with the weather. Really nice atmosphere and cool restaurants and bars around. Try to avoid the restaurants on the pier, and use those from the main street",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/8Pit
50,Holiday,This has such a good atmosphere with different things going on and everyone enjoying themselves it's definitely worth a visit with a beautiful beach either side we had a pretty great day here,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tangye99
30,Expensive and anticlimactic,"It was cool to cross this place off the list, but with people along the way encouraging me to take my 3 yr old there, I was expecting something better than it was. The arcade is ok I guess, but I'm not sure why you'd want to spend time inside when you could be out enjoying the sunshine, and the rides aren't that exciting, especially with a very little kid - we didn't partake.He was mostly interested in the waves crashing into the pier and I wasn't really taken by any of it - I've seen better views and the food on offer wasn't appealing. Could have skipped it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/587hannahk
50,Historical place of the Cali culture,Obligatory visit if you go to LA. Old theme park in a legendary broadwalk in a great place. Pure 80's,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheFineTraveller
50,Santa Monica Pier,Great spot and cool to visit at night when everything is lit up. Lots of people around and it's nice and safe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bwarr2017
50,Wow--Incredible View,"It was easy to get to from Pico Boulevard (Big Blue Bus 7) and it only cost $1 for two. The Pier was crazy busy--Saturday, on a beautiful clear day, blue skies, and hot. Just loved the whole busy atmosphere, the entertainment, the beautiful view, and the gorgeous beach. There is something for everyone,--little ones, teenagers, and adults. Lots of places to drink and eat as well as souvenir shops. The beach was pristine, beautiful sand, and small waves. Loved it as our attraction before going home to Ontario, Canada.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yolandeb909
40,Sunset @ Santa Monica,Beautiful time to visit at sunset. Great for 'people watching' too. Lots of food options & restaurants along the foreshore. The market stalls along the beach ... dodgy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eddy2808
40,"Beautiful views, great spot to stop for anyone!","Great views, lots of things to do, rides, an aquarium, great sand beach. Just make sure if you are wanting to do the rides, you check that they are running at the time (we were there in the off season so rides weren't always going). Lots of food and souvenir options, from fancier sit down restaurants to burger and milkshake places. Would be a great place to go with kids, lots for them to do! Also a beautiful spot to stop for couples, family etc! There is also a nice path down the beach, we walked down to Venice beach along it, well maintained with access to clean washroom facilities, as well as water fountains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SupermanRockstar
20,Overrated,"We wanted to visit the famous Santa Monica Pier! But once we were there.. It felt dilapidated. Lot of attractions were permanently closed, as were some food stands.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elisabeth2511
50,Pier,Lots of fun lots and people plenty of places to eat carnival rides for the kids and adults lots of free entertainment along the boardwalk and you're good to go where Forrest Gump turned around to start running back home,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/856hughw
50,Great!,We walked the pier and had a blast. My daughter loved the rides and the sites. The music on the pier was also great!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rhondah866
50,Nice view,We didn't stay in Santa Monica long but it's nice view I would like to go back and get to stay there longer seeing as we was in a rush.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pedro29uk
40,Post Card!,Nice pier with a lot to do but watch out for people coming from venice beach smoking marijuana since marijuana is recreational there. Keeping my kids away from people smoking was a little bit of a challenge. I expected the pier to be more than it was though,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrsgoode
40,Fun at the boardwalk,"We visited the pier pretty late in the night, just before closing but it's a fun place to be. Beautiful in the night. There are street artists, Singers, carts selling trinkets and food.The rides themselves aren't that cheap. 8 bucks per person for the Ferris wheel itself but worth the view.I'd recommend the Pier Burger joint!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shelby789
40,Fun to see once,"My boyfriend and I stopped here while I was in town for business. It was a fun spot to escape for an hour or two. After seeing it once, I don't know if we would go back again, but I'm glad we went. As with all very touristy spots, expect to pay top dollar for any rides, food, or souvenirs you purchase. We rode the Ferris wheel, which has beautiful views of the coast and was worth the price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeSuriel
50,Fun place to visit,"We spent a day here with our teenagers. It was so much fun! We played in the ocean, ate lunch and dinner at the local restaurants, and rode rides at Pacific Park. Parking is close and there are changing rooms to change into and out of swimming attire. 🙂",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I1vy
50,Beautiful Santa Monica,Visited Santa Monica Pier and Santa Monica Beach as our first stop in LA. Was clean and beautiful. Beach is huge and really very pretty. Definitely worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/110stepheniep
50,Don't rent your bike on the pier!,"You pay much lesser if you rent your bike from the shop steps away from the pier.Nice and relaxing to spend a sunday here, taking in the atmosphere, cycling along the beach to Venice, stopping along the way to watch people skateboarding and all sorts of other beach activities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ho-taylorfan-sg
50,Great,Very nice place to visit !! A lot of good restaurants of different foods and prices and a small park for kids,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alvar54
50,You seen it this in many movies.,This Pier is one of the places what I and many others have seen in the movies. Exotic place in St. Monica. Lot of people are watching different kind entertainment as the pier offer. Amazing to look at the people around. If you just visit and travel by car park directly at the pier. 2$ per hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pepasved
40,Get there early for a pier all to yourself,"We have gone twice in the last two months. Both times on a Saturday.There is a lot to see on the pier as well as surrounding area and with Albricht's for lunch, it could not be a better day.Once we were able to park on the pier, but if not there are lots of beach parking for $8 vs city parking. All depends on what you want to do for the day. The second time we ended up doing the amusement park in the morning, late lunch, and toes in the sand after to relax.As the day goes along the crowd gets larger, so the arcade with little ones is better earlier than later. However each time we leave the traffic is piling in to see the sunset, maybe we will stick around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlwaysExploring17
20,Cheesy and Tacky,"The Santa Monica Pier has always been a fun place to go to walk the pier and maybe ride some of the rides. This last time we went, things have been changed a little, with more development on and around the pier. We visited on a Saturday, and it was crazy busy with people. To me, it felt junky and tacky. I felt like I was at a sideshow of a rundown traveling circus with cheesy vendors selling worthless souvenirs and making tacky art. Maybe I've just gotten older and expect more, but it wasn't someplace I'd want to go back to, and I've never felt that way when visiting it before. It was sad.Parking was only $1 an hour, which was very reasonable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5280momma
30,Difficult access,We walked along the path and found it too difficult to find the access point so did not walk out on the pier. Very disappointing to see an enormous car park on the beach next to the pier. Saw the wheel in motion. The pier liked a bit commercial. I would suggest you walk to venice beach from the pier. That was amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebB669
40,Fun spot,A must see in Santa Monica...was great to wander around and see the sights. Great little coffee shop on the pier and lots of local artisans selling their wares. We came away with a few gems.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OwlChild
50,Beautiful day in Santa Monica,"Spent a whole day in Santa Monica between the pier, the beach and the 3rd St Promenade. Lots to do on the pier, fun for the kids and great food options all around, especially on the way to 3rd St Promenade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jstaines72
30,Good time,Had a good time walking along the beach and the pier. Really great view of the horizon and the gorgeous sun setting over the Pacific Ocean,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rach00002015
40,Nice walk,"It is a nice place to take a walk. Some musicians and street performers make it a really nice promenade.It is not a 'must' to visit, but it is nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AiViDi
50,Fun,"Always love to visit the pier, great atmosphere and love all the buskers & street performances.Then a quick walk to the shopping outlets.It's always a great day out",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/974tracys
40,Great view,After hearing so much perhaps I over expected. It was a pier. With a carnival on it Beautiful sunsets.Paid parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/465cammyc
30,Take a long walk off of it.,"This place is a landmark however I don't really share in the sentiment. I've been coming here for years since I was little and I don't think it has changed. From the Rollercoaster to people fishing from the end, you always know what you will get at this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/436stug
50,"Great Stop , Lots see and do","Like the title states, this is a great stop on an LA trip. This place is BUSY. The roads here are small so prepare to have quick reflexes when entering and leaving one of the many parking lots. The Pier is amazing in itself, so much to do from rides to restaurants. If you're thinking about stopping by, just do it, it's worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuxDres
50,Pier,Fantastic. Lots of fun. The pier is a fun place to hang out. Lots of good food. I will definitely be back to Santa Monica,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heart586
30,Average pier,Very underwhelmed but this pier and expected a lot more activity to be thereA few restaurants and rides but that is all,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rwe003
30,Crowded on a weekend,"We went on a Sunday. It's pretty & was VERY busy. It's ok here, the funfair makes this stand out on the skyline for miles, but we refer other smaller, less busy piers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahe832
50,Gotta go!,So fun! Enjoyed a fun crowd. Rode the Ferris wheel and had great views for miles! The roller coaster is very tame but fun. Just a great ambiance and tons of fun! Enjoy!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3dogsinthecountry
50,Beautiful views and family fun!,"My family and I love to visit the Pier when in California. Good food and fun for everyone, and the beach just steps away. There is hours worth of fun. You can really capture beautiful photos as well. The only thing is that it can get pretty packed here and parking can be a challenge at peak hours. Of course you have to pay for parking everywhere in California which is a bummer. Overall we love it here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/146laylac
40,Aim for sunset!,"Amazing view of the sunset. It's really the a typical peer but what give it the points for me is the experience and fun factor. The view of the sun setting and moving into the night, lights going on behind is just relaxing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/achitembo
40,Grab a beer and hang put with the fishers,Walk past the rides and attraction and grab a nice cold beer around an hour before sunset. Walk down to the end of the pier (more beer there) and watch the locals fish. The views and the sound of the sea are good for the soul. Then the suns goes down and the pier lights up. All is good in the world.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mpc1723
50,Excellent,"We had a lovely day , got an uber out to the pier , we enjoyed a stroll along the pier , browsing at the stalls and then down to Venice beach, it's a LA must do!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/968ChrisS
50,Wonderful Place,My son and I came here while on vacation to the LA area from Florida. Such a beautiful place. The views are spectacular and it was so much fun watching all the musicians performing on the Pier. There was a violinist playing while we were there named Daniel Morris who was amazing to watch. Definitely want to go back next time we visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tedlong29
50,a must see if in the area,Fun place to watch people and buy expensive t-shirts. Several good restaurants to choose from I like Bubba Gumps. the sunset is very good from this location,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/creekmo1
40,Nice,As expected...nice walk along the promenade. We then had a great meal at the Cheesecake Factory. Good day out of the city,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claasman
30,Nice,"It was March. The crowd wasn't bad. The weather was great. It is very clean. Sometimes, you just need to people watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/99ThomasG99
10,Totally Tacky,"Being from NJ, and growing up with the whole boardwalk scene, I have to laugh about the area where the ""surf music"" emanated from. Being on the Santa Monica Pier was like being back in Seaside Heights NJ, just a different ocean. The weather, of course, is much nicer year round, but aside from that, fahgedaboudit! (And the traffic in the area is LA typical ridiculous)!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Conseiller99
50,Santa Monica is a lovely place but make sure get the right hotel for your stay.,The beach at Santa Monica a little windy but great sunshine. Take a stroll on the pier a great place to have a walk or hire a bike there are Evan Segway's for hire if you are not feeling it 😳,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevebO8986HN
30,Not great,"This place was below par for me .. lots of people on a peir watching some weird acts , bubba gump restaurant overcrowding and grubby , bad parking and rubbish everywhere .. I was expecting a bit more , not going to go back",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pad123456
20,Not worth,"We had a high recommend from Trip Advisor members to go, but at 9pm everything is closed already, can you believe it? Far away from everything, all restaurants and bars closes before 9pm on all Santa Monica. It was a waste of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fernandodP8893NF
50,Great day at the pier,"We took the afternoon and drove from LA to Santa Monica. Traffic was a little heavy around 10:30 am on a Friday but it was manageable.The area is really quite lovely, even quaint in some areas.We parked in Public Parking about 5 blocks from the Pier and headed through the Promenade on our way to Pier. Lots of great shopping, restaurants, street musicians and people watching. Sun was shining and it was a bit cool so the walk was great.Heading over the ""bridge"" to the Pier was crowded but not claustrophobic. It was pretty clean and felt comfortable wandering around. It smelled of funnel cakes and sugar. Love it. We walked down to the end on one side and back down the other. Took a flight of steps down to the beach and went for a short walk past Muscle Beach.We spent about 2 hours wandering the Pier and the beach. Then we headed across the street for lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Humplov
30,Way too crowded,I guess every visit to Santa Monica requires a walk along the beach and the pier. It was so crowded even though it's outside you felt like you were in a pack. Tourists mixing with a lot of the locals going for a day at the beach plus all the homeless people sleeping on the beach and along the walkway did make for the best experience. The kiosks and food vendors along the pier are kind of cheap and cheesy. Pass.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusB962
40,Go early!,We arrived at the pier around 11am when the rides open. We were able to get parking right on the pier and it was only $2 hr or $10 for the day. It was a perfect time of day to go. It wasn't crowded yet and made for a relaxing stroll with the little ones. We loved the vibe of the street musicians and while the rides were expensive it was worth it to give the kids the experience of a couple of rides on the Santa Monica Pier. Going early was the key here!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/511katiem
30,TOURIST DELIGHT,A real tourist place and if you dont get to see it dont get upset. good for kids and not a bucket list of things to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sobelfam
50,Santa Monica Pier,A fun place to go. Places to eat and rides for the whole family. Vets memorial in the sand on the week-ends.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/true1172
40,Fun!,"Lots of people however lots of space. There is alot of fast food, drink, some rides and people watching. There is entertainment and beautiful views of the ocean. Parking is hard as you have to park on the street so it could mean some walking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vanessamtz910
50,A must do,"Any visit to LA should include a visit to Santa Monica Pier. Great outlook - the clam seafood chowder at the restaurant on the left hand side (can't remember the name) was fabulous. Don't forget to get a selfie near the sign showing ""the end of Route 66""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D9466YLkimm
30,Last stop of Route 66,Parking was oddly easy enough to find( it was 5 pm on a Thursday in March so I don't know if that makes a difference) but I was pretty crowded which makes me a little uncomfortable with my young kids. But we just walked to the end of the peir. Watched people playing on the beach. And the street performers all over the place.I had been here before but it was in the middle of the night then.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kelleyj812
30,Scenic but mostly touristy,"Not bad for checking out the view but I wouldn't need more than an hour or so to see it all. There are some street performers, cheap souvenirs and fair or carnival food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ashley32905
40,Lively,"It's a place where lots of people have their memories of sunsets, arcades and fun to eat tid-bits and wonderful drawn portraits. Come here with your special someone or with a group of friends, and you'll find many wonderful places to check out. I highly recommend stopping by four specific places on the pier.1. 66-to-CaliThis is the original Route 66 shop, full with memorabilia and Route 66 authentic American made products.2. Soda JerksTheir sweet choices on Ice creams are truly delicious and budget friendly. They work with different renditions of flavors so you'll definitely want to get your sweets here.3. Pier BurgerQuite possibly the only budget friendly, worth paying food for at the pier. You get what you pay for and it's delicious as well.4. Arcades and ridesDefinitely the most fun you'll have on the pier. Highly recommendedDon't forget to watch the sunsets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fistoflight
10,Like a tired old British pier,"2 Brits on vacation. Spent $25 on a taxi from our hotel to go to the pier having heard so much about it. Admittedly it was out of season and dusk but nothing was happening, except a couple of gift shops and a slot machine palace. We walked to the end - should have jumped off!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L4592CCjoeb
30,Nice Family Attraction,Beware of drug addicted locals. Average attraction for families with adolescents. I would not recommend for young children due to the drug scene and some squalid conditions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StarLiteWishes51
50,Just like the movies!,"I halfway expected to see NCIS: LA characters here. Clean, safe, with great street performers and good vendors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tkempster
40,"Fun, historic, atmospheric.","Firstly, it is fun and historic and atmospheric, but I would strongly advise you to keep your senses on high alert, this doesn't feel like a safe location. There are lots of beggars and street hawkers from the moment you hit the pier complex from Ocean Avenue.Having said that there are so many tourists around that it gave me a feeling of security, safety in numbers.The pier and Ferris Wheel, is definitely one of those places that's on the bucket list. It has an old fashion feeling being constructed of mainly wood.Also get your picture taken with the ""end of the route 66"" sign. Pretty cool.There are lots of places to eat on the pier, but they looked expensive.At the end of the pier there are lots of info boards about it's history.So who knew that Santa Monica pier was originally built to pump sewage into the Pacific.Certainly not me until I read the history posters at the end of the pier.It also turns out that the original sailor that pop-eye was based on sailed from the pier as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Newinnman
50,A ok,My 5 year old was dying to come here to go on the merry go round and even though fog consumed the view it was everything we expected and more.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/404karanc
30,Teeny bopper pier,"The pier is a requisite tourist stop, but why? Sure, there is a roller coaster, otherwise I recommend just sun bathing on the beach or renting a bike and rolling down the path. The pier was super crowded on Sunday and the food was subpar carnival food or tourist franchised. (Bubba Gump Shrimp).Don't get me wrong. I recommend visiting Santa Monica and the pier, but unless you are a teen or are visiting with kids, I would't budget more than 30 mins for the pier and certainly don't spend the $ to park on it. Any of 20 restaurants across Ocean Ave and on the Promenade are better plus parking is cheaper too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/461nickr
30,Worth Visiting,The pier is a great place for a view and a few fun rides. The arcade is pretty old and the games are worn as well but a fun experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mgeagles
30,More touristy stuff,"After spending some time in the LA area, evething begins to look the same. Just more shops selling tourists the same thing you see in any city. The beach looked nice and the view of the land was nice. Only spent about 30 min here and that was long enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/retsekud
20,Amusement at the Beach,"The pier is an entertaining destination. Prices are a little high, but it's fun to people watch. I personally believe that this is more entertaining if you have children with you. It's a bit on the dirty side which is why I gave it a two. If you haven't been, one should stop and decide for yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LBenson75
40,Must ser,Lovely pier worth a visit as part of touring the area. Fairground rides and restaurants available although I did not try them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoThackray
40,"Will return, with kids in tow.",Cute iconic area to check out. We went way to early in the morning and almost everything was closed. So we returned at midday and things were a lot more active. Food options were good and plenty of activities for families as well as a bar for adults. Great views,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/796kellyh
50,Fun just walking on the Santa Monica Pier.,This the idea place for family with children to go for fun. I truly enjoyed just walking on the pier. A must go place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/558katherineb
50,Wow,Loved the rides.Great evening out with family while visiting.Nice option before a few days of Disneyland coming up for us.Rides were ok.... expensive.Many food choices.Pier entertainment wad fabulous.Parking $5 just below the pier off to one side. Ample parking for the time we showed up was 6pm on a weekday.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichChichLet
40,Interesting,We didn't have the best weather that day but I would suggest visiting here. It is quite the place for people watching! The pier had a bunch of kiosks and performers. We didn't eat on the dock but there are places to get a bite to eat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAMBelden
50,Great afternoon,Went there as 2 couples nearing the end of our hwy 1 trip down from San FranciscoPretty cool place all in all. Plenty to look at and plenty of history,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aaron000026
40,Great place to visit,"Very lively place , for families, big or small groups and couples. Sunset will be a perfect time to take pictures. That is where Rout 66 begins and/or ends. different food choices, street artists, and many different souvenir carts. You can park on the pier itself, or use the city parking with 5-10 minutes walk to the pier. Usually colder than the city ,would be a good idea to take an extra jacket or buy one there as souvenir to take home",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alizan2015
40,"Cool, but crowded and dirty","Large pier with lots to see and do, pretty views of the beach and LA from end of pier. Very busy and dirty, typical carnival type rides and food, nothing special. Nice to say I have been there, but not really worth the crowds if you are not going to ride the rides...take a picture from the beach, just as pretty!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mychalr2018
10,Like visiting a dirty carnival next to an ocean,"I did not enjoy my visit here. It was packed, loud and dirty. I felt like I was at a cheap carnival next to the ocean. There were literally thousands of people here the day I visited. May appeal to some but definitely not for me,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/111Vacay111
40,Part of our holiday,"We stayed in Hollywood hotel, it is as near of everything so we look around and found the bus nearby that will take us to sta Monica pier. It takes about nearly two hours from hollywood. Sta Monica pier have lots of entertainment for children and the beach are nice and sunny and good for sunbathing . Lots of places to eat . Then we walked and found the town centre with lots of shopping and good restaurant . Sea foods and steak are good . We comeback second time by tour . I will never forget the experienced",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wildt2016
50,Great place to burn time,"We had a 6 hr layover today so we decided to go to the pier for fun. It was a great day, not crazy busy but enjoyable with 2 small children. Not much choices in food however something for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mdecker17
10,Santa Monica pier,"As far as motels go, a good one is hard to find. El Rancho was a haven after numerous motel stays. Not typical as rooms were spacious and the place is clean with in room dining set up. The staff pleasant. I would return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K352ZTkareng
50,A stroll on a cool day,"A big, busy pier- lots to see and do. Saw some locals fishing, theme park if you pay entry in there is some good value deals (unlimited rides etc) Lots of places to eat. Aquarium under the pier which would be great for kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alanaboma
30,Way to crowded,Went on a Sunday and it was way too crowded. Had to park a 10 minute walk away and spent a lot of money doing so. the rides had long lines too. Still is a fun place to go and bring the kids and not have to spend much money as long as you only let them take a ride or two.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamlV2890DH
50,Nice place to visit,"We took the Starline hop on hop off bus to Santa Monica Pier. They have some rides and games there. A couple of restaurants. A very nice beach! It's nice if you want to spend the day at the beach!We didn't spend a whole lot of time on the pier, only because we aren't into the rides and games.. but we did take a nice walk along the boardwalk.. or you can rollerblade or bike. Great views! Ocean is gorgeous! The day we were there, it was chilly and foggy. Would've been a lot better if the sun was out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/472connieg
40,Fun but Could Do w/o Crowds,"Went for a visit on a Sunday and, as you'd expect, it was pretty crowded. Crowded, despite the fact that it was a cool and cloudy day, with winds too high for fishing.Nevertheless we had a pleasant time walking around and listening to the musicians. We let our inner child out at Pacific Park. Good quality of rides and a broad range of attractions. Just as fun for two grown-ups as it would have been for a family.I really only had two complaints: 1) that all of the change machines in the arcade were out of order, so we and many others didn't get a chance to play and 2) parking was a damn nightmare that resulted in us shelling out big bucks to park under a hotel. Serves us right for going on a weekend, but still no fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/813caitlink
40,Great day out...,The weather was very cool but that wasn't Santa Monica's fault. The folks working on the pier were so friendly.I would go again but not in that same day the marathon was running.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/don7614
50,Loved the views,"To experience wandering along the pier with a warm churros was amazing. You don't realise how far you are walking from the start by the 'end of Route 66' sign to being over the water.There is so much to see and do, from going on the wheel to get stunning views of the coastline to seeing the carousel and of course - the shops. The pier is such an iconic place, featuring in so many films it was just so great an experience to enjoy.If you in the LA area this is a must see place to experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mald03ives
50,Lots of spring break fun,We loved the pier lots to do from rides to eating. We were there at sunset it was amazing and we left late into the evening we walked from our hotel Venice beach it was a beautiful walk. The pier offers all sorts of rides and every type of food drink or snacks you can think of. It's a fun place for all ages lots of vendors selling art and knick knacks and clothing. Highly recommend,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vlad178tx
40,Where The Tourists Go,"In fairness, we were tourists as well when we came here. It was an overcast day in the off-season, yet everyone crammed into the relatively small area and it was hard to enjoy the sights when battling thousands of others for shoulder space. We found much more peace and space to enjoy on the beach itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xScience
50,Vacation,Great Pier and area with lots of action! Many good places to eat. Nice beach. Parking was a little expensive. Lots of people having a good time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/farran2
30,Nice pier,"Nice pier but Santa Cruz boardwalk blows it away, this felt a little more like for couples where as Santa Cruz caters more to families with children with lots more rides and attractions for kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WIWIandBRAD
50,Fun!!!,"Great place for fun, food and entertainment. People were surfing, fishing, dancing, sunning, riding the rides. It's a blast!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luttig7
50,Day at the beach,We made a point to visit the pier. It was fun to walk through the shops and enjoy the views from the end of the pier. It was also a great place to people watch. We had fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joangel418
40,Old fashioned pier,"Avoid weekends and very busy and you will not be able to park,go midweek.Worth a hour or so wandering round, some good street musicians.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trevorkmcc2020
30,A Zoo,"Went there on a Sunday was so busy hard to even walk around let alone park, I would go during the week if possible",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W2613SMjohnm
50,Fun fun fun,We had fun on the pier! There was a lot of entertainment and food. We watched the sunset and it was Beautiful against the beach and mountains. The temperature was great during the day however at night it was really chilly. (Middle of March) great location for kids,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luvtravel06
50,Sunset in Santa Monica,"Perfect way to finish the day, the sunset at Santa Monica is breathtaking, and not to be missed if you're in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SergioR4683
40,An Iconic Destination,"The Pier at Santa Monica has been the backdrop for many movies and TV shows. It is a bit of a walk from the Metro that we came from. There is a downhill walk going to the pier and the uphill walk leaving seems steeper but is doable. The pier has an assortment of restaurants, amusements, shops and street vendors. There is a beautiful indoor carosel and a ferris wheel that is lit up with neon every night. It is certainly worth a visit when you're in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/951pamelan
30,Gentle,"In west Los Angeles. It reminds me a little of South Street Seaport in New York. It begins a sunny blue sky day but as we were driving toward the coast, the fog suddenly appeared, as if out of nowhere. The street cleaner said, hope the skies will clear … unfortunately it didn’t. We walked to Venice Beach in the cold. As we’re driving back in the afternoon, the sun reappeared again, and hot 80 degree.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/354irenee
30,A most of our holiday but somewhat disappointed,"We had to come here of course as staying in the area, def not like the movies...lol...We personally found the Arcade part of the pier, dirty, and congested, didnt feel like it was laid out at all, but thats our thoughts. As we had been given discounts for tickets being we flew Air New Zealand that was a bonus as certainly not worth the price we think, kids liked some of the rides, and the arcade games too, though compared to Disneyland and Vegas we found this part expensive, and the soft toys were really cheap and nasty some of the staff (as young) where rude and not really interested in doing their job, but we did come here first week of Jan so maybe thats why, kids working who didnt really want to work. The one person who was amazing was the gentlemen in the office shop by kids merry go round inside he was fabulous, helpful and informative, thats the saviour here. We did go for a stroll along the beach even though not weather for it, but a must when you here and that was cool, the kids even though cold as, still played on the beach, so I would say do visit but be prepared its going to cost you...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shadow0608
40,Great to spent some time,Nice place to have some random fun! Was there twice (2014 & 2016) and had fun. The best part was to see the sunset from out of the Ferris wheel !!! And the contrast between watching at the ocean and waves and the fun park!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saraihamburg
50,Fun trip,The pier was super cute with an old timey feel. The bracelets for the kids were $60 for two to ride unlimited rides. We went during spring break and it wasn't very crowded. You can fish from the pier. Several street performers were playing music. The beach is right next to it. Pretty fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Callielyn83
40,What a great sight to see,If you like honky tonk this is the place to see. There's a lot going on here and it's crowded. Plenty of food choices and things to do. This place is eye candy for kids. Great views of the ocean and mountains.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/967hald
10,"Crowded, dodgy and overpriced",Perhaps walk down it to say you have done it but really I found it overwhelming disappointing. Too many people not enough to do looking a bit tired and old.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leeroy22
40,Definitely worth a visit.,"Definitely worth a visit if you're visiting Santa Monica. Sure it's a tourist trap but there's a nice vibe and pretty views over the ocean.Nice spot for sunset photo opportunities or nighttime pics with the colourful lights in the background.Not a huge choice in terms of food, mainly burgers and the very touristy Bubba Gumps, I'd recommend walking back off the pier and turning right, a block or so down is ""Bruno's"", where you'll find some hearty Italian food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rinni1974
20,Santa Monica,Beach was nice and the board walk was cool to pass time with. Seabrite was a cool seafood stop. Fresh fish and cold brews,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevenfB9408ER
50,View to Die for,"Santa Monica itself looked as a very lively and jovial place. The people here were very friendly as one of the Uber drivers promptly got back my phone left in his car and dint charge an extra penny. Hats off to him. This Pier was damn colorful and it looks even more amazing during sunset. When the last few golden lights off the day sets in this place, the photographer in you springs up into action. This is one of the best place to get some perfect silhouette pictures if you are a serious photographer. There aren't much choice for food for vegetarians. That was a major drawback for us. The pier at night along with the lighting is a view that anyone would cherish forever.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ankit_Adiga
30,Too crowded and touristy,This place is hyped and overrated. Way too crowded and hard to move around. We went midday on a weekday. Maybe that's peak but I won't go back another time to find out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tapin7
50,Nostalgic,"Took a Whirlwind Hollywood tour from Vegas and The Pier was our first stop. It seemed well kept and safe. The beach was beautiful and the pier brought back memories of summers past in a much more relaxed and simpler time.We were there before the ride section was really open completely for the day but between the beach and stores and rides, there is plenty to do for a full day of fun in the sun. Make Pier Burger a stop for a complete 60's pier experience",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelbV1807XT
50,Great Spot!,"This a great spot to kill some time, enjoy the ocean breeze, take in a sunset, people watch, relax or play on the beach, stroll along the boardwalk, grab a bite to eat AND be highly entertained by some of the awesome street performers. I had a lot of fun here with my mom. We had just gotten in from our flight from Seattle and were looking for something low key to do. This was perfect. And we were surprised to see that it is the end of good old Route 66!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizzlebit13
40,Beautiful walk,I felt it was too small compared to seaside heights or Atlantic city it was nice tho more for the kids there's also a small aquarium adults pay only $5 kids are free beach cleaner than newyorks and parking is only $6 there's bike rentals and bike lanes on the beach nice concession stand beach themed,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariakI9306VZ
30,"Nothing New, but Great Sunsets",I don't have much to say as I've been to many piers across the US and this one isn't anything special. It's about what you'd expect. There are some food options that are decent and there are a few attractions for kids but other than that and maybe people watching it's just ok. The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is the sunsets there are gorgeous.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ckkeane411
30,Quick family atop,The pier was a great place to stop when visiting the area- be warned it is a very crowded area.The beach is beautiful but the water is cold- the kids don't seem to mind. Plus the view of the mountains in the distance is incredible.The pier itself is nice but pricey. So make sure to eat before hand or expect to pay a lot- we did enjoy a delicious funnel cake. The shops are way over priced!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shadyhellman
50,Great Time!,We visited in February 2017. It was our first Pier visit ever and really enjoyed it. We have a daughter that enjoyed the rides - we did visit during the week and multiple rides were managed by 1 person. Taking a picture at night with the Ferris Wheel in the background was pretty neat. We would visit again!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tpuls
30,Fun but typical pier,"First and foremost we enjoyed our time here. That said, there isn't a ton about the pier that's unique. Nice carnival rides, etc. and the views were good. I'd prioritze it lower if you're trying to figure out what to do in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jelmutiger
40,Its what you see in the films,"Nothing beats a nice walk along the pier on a sunny day. Some of the entertainment is a bit strange, but overall really good. Lots of good places to eat and drink. Loved it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ankersandrew
50,Great Walking and Taking in the Sights.,"The day we walked on the pier was cool and overcast, but it didn't stop people from walking up and down the boardwalk. Unknown to us, it is the end point for the fabled Route 66 (which begins in Chicago). There are lots of activities to temp the adventurous and even the more temperate in nature (the ferris wheel looked like it would be a cool activity on a sunny day).A great way to spend a lazy afternoon with good friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/terryh659
40,Pier,It's a big pier on the ocean with lots of entertainment to keep people interested. Good for the kids,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/857chrisj
50,Food and shopping on the pier,"I had the best, freshest lobster tail Ive ever had life just $22. Ur was heavenly!!! When I finished that, we went. Ack forRound two...truffleFries with lobster for just $8. What a feast! The Santa Monica Pier has something for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChevyCruise
50,Good place to hang our,Beautiful sunsets and interesting people. People doing street shows. Many restaurants around.Long walk all the way out to the ocean.The beach is beautiful,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmayoral1
40,Santa Monica Pier,"Beautiful view, restaurants and souvenir shops. Beach access and parking. Had a good visit there. Lots of food vendors too. Rides for the family. Glad we stopped on our road trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R5488TWcathym
50,Great place to stroll,Spent the day at Santa Monica Pier and Venice Beach. Superb location for a stroll along the beach in excellent weather. Many bars and restaurants to stop on the way. Great atmosphere. Will definately go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Themicks566374
40,Beautiful place for a Half marathon!,"Last October I ran a half marathon on a gorgeous Sunday morning! It looped around the pier a couple times and we ran down through Venice Beach and then back on the bike path! It was a flat, scenic race as we watched the sunrise come out over the pacific. Definitely a bucket list run and I really enjoyed my time on the famous SM beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beccarter10
30,Day Trip,"We decided to take a day trip to try a nearby restaurant and take in the pier.I am a So Cal native that had never been there. This was around Christmas time and it was extremely crowded which made it difficult to simply take in the sights. I'm not anxious to go back any time soon to possibly go elbow to elbow with sea of fellow tourists.There's plenty of chain restaurants that are family friendly with a small amusement park. Plenty of tourist trap shopping also. Pretty sight overlooking the ocean, but I can get the same thing with fewer people elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeAnnC51
30,Beautiful views,This is a nice pier. There are many little booths with souvenirs and lots of carnival type foods. There are some rides. There is a nice view off the end of the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trishakelley
50,Magical Day at the Pier,We took the bus and a train there from Culver City. Did not take long. Weather was perfect and there was a slight breeze. There was live music playing in a few different locations on the pier. We bought some affordable souvenirs. A unique hologram type picture of my boyfriend and me. I bought a 3-D piece of handpainted glass work that was really awesome but unfortunately got broken on the plane ride home. I wish I could replace it but there was no business card with this gentleman's artwork. Ate lunch at the pier. Had chicken nachos and freshly prepared guacamole made tableside. Everything tasted wonderful! Beautiful view of the beach with mountains in the background. Got lots of great photos! I hope to be back again one day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tammyl98
50,Amazing atmosphere at both day & night!,"On our first night in LA, we visited the pier and it was all lit up and still busy with locals and tourists. I felt like I was on hannah montana the movie! We then visited during the day, later on in the week, and the atmosphere was amazing. Definitely a must visit for anyone visiting, so many amazing memories to capture and share with your family and friends!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmilyGoldie
30,Beautiful views but pier not so much,"The beach was nice but the pier wasn't that impressive to be honest. You have to pay for parking, pier is full of people singing or playing an instrument in the hopes of getting some of your loose change. The rides for the kids are ok I was not too impressed with the variety of places to eat. However the views the homes around the beach amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/452jamid
50,"Lovely sunset, fun and romantic atmosphere!",Great ambience from late afternoon past sunset. Beautiful sunset view and atmosphere with the usual musicians and artists. Rides were all fun and family friendly and there were quiet a few restaurant options. Great way to spend your evening,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elfuego_vazquez
50,Lovely atmosphere.. family friendly.,"My husband and I went to Santa Monica pier on a sunny Saturday March day.Plenty of place to park. Do your research before hand to find the cheapest, the one we used was $8 for the day. Get there early before 9am to miss the queues.The pier is free to get on with plenty of eateries and entertainment to keep you busy for a few hours. There's a fairground and arcade and numerous street performers and sellers.Great place to people watch and relax in the sun.(I was put off from going to Venice beach by the amount of reviewers who mentioned the amount of homeless that were at that particular beach. Whilst there were a few here at Santa Monica beach there wasn't so many that made it a problem for me.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CSSmith5
50,love it,Great old syle pier - all the usual stuff pluse a gorgeous carosel inside. Lovely to walk along and just take in the atmosphere,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CookGang
40,"Eat, watch the beautiful views and have fun!","Santa Monica Pier offers a lot of things to do. It's super touristy but that's not a surprise. Eat, watch the beautiful views and have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jrosenbergh
30,Slightly disappointed,"Probably went too early in the day, but not much was going on. The beach is kind of dirty and homeless/beggars hanging out on the beach. The pier itself was mostly closed, at 10 am. We might go back at night and see if the atmosphere is a little different.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrandiS718
40,Great atmosphere,Great visit for people watching and seeing so many different characters on the pier is an eye opener. A must for all tourists.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hclarke101
30,Pretty,"Santa Monica pier was okay, nothing spectacular. The beach was better, but turn around before you get close to Venice beach because that area is very sketchy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roxanneb0
40,Touristy but fun to visit with friends.,"My best friend had never been to Los Angeles before, so when she was here I took her to the pier (among other places). I had been there multiple times, but never on the Ferris wheel, so we did that together once it got dark. It was a lot of fun, and the view was amazing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenstrisower
50,A gem,"This is such a cultural icon! You can just sit and people watch all day!! From the tourists to the pier artists to the fantastic view, there is something for everyone!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephaniemK2593IM
40,Nice place to visit,Worth a visit if your in LABest to go late afternoon or early. Lots of souvenir shops.Great views of the coast as far as Malibu.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pdcs4
40,great fun for kids,"my wife and i took our two nephews aged 6 and 8 to the pier and they loved it. i thought that maybe we'd get an hour or two out of it but the boys just couldn't get enough. after walking the length of the pier and checking out the people fishing, we bought the unlimited rides ticket for the kids and they rode every ride at least 6 times, some maybe 10 times. throw in an ice-cream and we had the makings of a perfect afternoon and two very tired little boys who slept very well that night!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/divenuts
40,Weekday visit,"I included walking the length of the pier and people watching as part of my daily ""get out of the house and walk"" goal.It was sunny and a pleasant spring temperature on the day I went, and not too breezy.I enjoyed watching and contributing to the street performances, chatting with random people, and helping vacationers by playing photographer so that their family pictures would have everyone in the group in the photo.And of course I bought a couple of small souvenirs for grand-nephews along the way.Because there are so many things to see and do, I achieved my step goal and my time outside, interacting with others goal. It was fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WagMoreBarkLess7308
40,Good for a few hours visit,"Great for a few hours. There are rides, food outlets and plenty to entertain both adults and children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B2811BVphilt
40,Fun visit -- wheelchair issues,This is fun place to visit. The ferriswheel ride is a classic must do. Good place to stop and have fun while touring the LA area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rightfoot
30,Great Place to People Watch,"Going to SM Pier is a nice walk on a pier with a lot of locals singing, painting, etc. for money. It's a great place to walk through then head to the beach on a sunny day. The pier itself is frankly over rated. However, the walking paths along the beach and the benches on the beach to enjoy the view is what makes the trip worthwhile. You can rent bikes as well to stroll along the cement path and bike for miles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IrisS571
50,The Pier,"A great place to walk around, go on rides, eat, fish, just walk and bask in the sun. The big downfall is: parking-get there early to park on pier ( its $20). Handicapped is FREE and always have a spot for you in the pier!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/351allanas
50,Fun Family Time,"Of course, Santa Monica Pier is in 2 out of every 3 movies you've ever seen so it's fun to go have a look, but it's also a fun, relaxed place to wander around on a nice afternoon. Lots of shops and rides in the area, and there are tons of people fishing. We did not get a chance to see the aquarium, but we spent a good hour just wandering around. Also, lots of live performers so bring some singles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eluper
30,Expected more,"I expected Santa Monica Pier to be more happening! Must say it was a bit of a let down but nevertheless, it's still worth a visit after hearing about it and having seen it in movies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ma-manators
50,Free live music and people watching,Something for everyone - the kids will like the carousel and rides.Plenty of street performers to gawk at.Cleaner restrooms are at the end of the pier!!!Highly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/107cl
40,Beautiful,Went to Santa Monica Pier as part of our trip to California. Beach is beautiful and nice to see where bay watch was filmed. It was quite cloudy when we visited which was a shame.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leehV9840JV
30,"Probably nice when the weather is better, ...","When we where there in February 2017 it was drizzling, chilly and windy. Understandably, we didn't linger too long. There is a small amusement park on the pier that might be something for the kids for times when the weather is better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nedomkull
20,This felt a little junky.,"Compared to other piers in LA, Santa Monica is my least favorite. It felt a little junky, too many people peddling goods and music. I prefer a low-key pier experience, where I can watch the ocean, chill out and relax.Not so much here, but I can see where this caters to a tourist in search of trinkets and knick-knacks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KMDimon
50,Fabulous location.,"We spent the afternoon walking around, people watching, enjoying the street buskers, great lunch at Mariasols, took loads of photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevinhB7173LQ

40,It's a must see place,The bad thing it's that all the restaurants where closing early the night we went ... but the site seen its good,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaimecr03
30,Santa Monica Peer,"Quaint, nice atmosphere, good views, short walk to city restaurants. Wait until the end of the pier before making any purchases :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikef854
30,Packed,It's incredible how many people can fit on the pier lots of street performers people generally had a good time but nothing you have to do,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/uli1
40,"Beautiful View, Carnival Atmosphere","If you like carnival food, gift shops and water, this is a great place. The end of Route 66 is also at the pier. We hit up the ferries wheel and coaster and had a blast on each. Friendly people, it was crowded even on a Thursday, but if you like you can always walk off the pier to the beach! Must see if you're in Santa Monica",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/celtics323
40,Great place to hangout,"It's a nice place to hangout with family or friends.There's an amusement center for kids and/or teens.When I was there, there were 3 or 4 local talents who were performing, so you can pick your own style.There were souvenier shops and snack bars too.The only negative thing was the traffic going there but other than that, it was one of the better places that I visited in South CA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/have_faith_BDM
30,Not that clean,I've heard so much about Santa Monica pier and beach in the past so I was so excited to spend a day there . I didn't enjoy it that much. It was dirty..... the city is beautiful though but not the beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mona123a
50,Great entertainment and virws,"Spent the day riding around and loved it, great street acts, felt very safe & relaxed. Lots of families around too, amazing talent here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karlam787

40,Always a treat,It's our third visit to the pier and this time we had the kids to show it to. They loved it. There are lots of this for them to enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taarhaug
50,Hire bikes!,"This was one of my favorite places in L.A. The pier was picturesque. I would recommend going on at least the fairest wheel if you can. We hired bikes for super cheap and took a ride down to Venice beach from the pier. It was about 7kms round trip, around 40mins super easy ride. Make sure you dont hit the sand and keep to the bike tracks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/189shellc
50,"Fun for all - lots to do, or just wander","Electric violins, drummers, acrobats, ferris wheels - it's all there at the Santa Monica Pier. Very county-fair, midway-like - lots of fun to just people watch. The Ferris Wheel is not expensive and you get a fabulous view of Santa Monica and the ocean. The ride lasts long enough to get a good look at everything. Lots to eat. Flying Trapeze artists do daring tricks-right there on pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatyS610
40,West coast version of Coney Island,"My son & I had a good time. We got on the Ferris Wheel and was able to take great pictures of the beach, the boardwalk & the sunset. Afterwards, we ate at Bubba Gumps.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daniellemK8361AI
30,Strolling in Santa Monica,Cute. Nice walk out to the pier. Great people watching. Chachkies being sold in various stalls and shops. Amusement rides were shut down in the evening by time we made our second trip down the pier... but beautiful light show on Gerri's wheel at night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LizBrick
50,"Kid at heart, great for everyone","End a long day at pier! It's perfect for everyone! There's plenty of options for food, games & local vendors. Feeling nostalgic, we jumped in a photo booth to capture the kid at heart feeling. Keep in mind a lot of the food options close early (after sunset) with the exception of Mariasols at the end of the pier. If you don't have a car, you can easily get there using the metro, connecting at union station (travel time: 40 mins-hour with stops). It's a fun activity that doesn't need to cost anything, just sit back, listen to the ocean, watch the sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LMPav
40,Ferris Wheel,"The scenery in the pier is great, but my wife was not to fund of the junkies that are all over the area since we have 4 young kids. Personally I loved the small amusement park and had a great time riding the Ferris wheel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnito
40,Santa Monica staple,"This was my second time at the pier. The first time was 10 years ago and I can't say much has changed. There are souvenir shops, an arcade, carnival type games, street artists, food stands, restaurants and of course, an amazing view of the Pacific, California coastline and beach. There is no charge to walk the pier, which is always a plus when on vacation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CoolBeanMe
30,The Sign is the Coolest Part,"This is basically a fishing pier with some amusement rides on it. It's honestly no great shakes. Take a walk, enjoy the view and take a selfie or two and move on. There's nicer stuff to see in SoCal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/750fredr
30,First time here,"Pacific Park is small. Not very many rides. Wasn't very busy. First time here, guess was expecting more",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danakayg
50,Walking along the Pier at night is a lot of fun!,I forgot how much fun it is to people watch on a warm evening in Santa Monica walking along the pier. It is free and just a great deal of fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daisyss
20,Nice view but way too crowded!,"I live close to the pier. Drive by it, walk by it but have not gone onto it in maybe 10 years. There are always a long line of people walking on to it, mostly families and tourists.....Just not my thing I guess.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gogoglennie
40,Fun People-Watching,"You'll recognize this famous pier from many movies, and that's exciting. The people-watching on the pier and throughout the several blocks near by is great! Nice restaurants and shops nearby. I didn't ride any rides--just enjoyed scenic views and interesting folks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mauibeth
40,The Pier that you must go,"There is tons of piers in California, but this one you must go. It´s a mix of cultures and different people, beutiful view and always you will take a good picture and good memories from this place.Há muitos piers na California, mas você não pode deixar de visitar este aqui. Tem um mix de pessoas diferentes e você sempre levará sempre uma boa foto e boas memorias deste lugar.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/irsespinoza
40,Iconic Must See,"as we were in santa monica we HAD to visit the famous pier.was lovely atmosphere, lots of hustle and bustle.If you get the chance its worth coming down at night as the wheel is light up beautifully!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenF85
50,Family Fun,"We walked out to the end of the pier and it was very busy with stalls, cafes and buskers. The sunset is spectacular. There are a lot of rides and at night they are lit up, you get a great light show. There is food for all tastes and the price is reasonable. If you like people watching this is the place to be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaniceThomas
40,Enjoyable visit,"I really enjoyed Santa Monica, the whole place had character and had a great food/shopping district. The pier was smaller than I expected but was still great to walk on and look back on the beach and distant views. Didn't eat there as they didn't look as appealing as the restaurants on the third promonade. Will definately be back to Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wander681323
40,Fun in the California sun,"This was the first spot we visited when we came to L.A. for our very first brief visit, and what a great place for our first taste of California! We had a relaxing afternoon strolling about, watching street performers, people-watching, popping into souvenir stores, listening to the waves and just basking in the glory of the Pacific and the California sun. Gorgeous sunset views as well!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Laufam_travellers
20,What a let Down,Tired worn out and full of junk. So disappointing not worth a trip unless you want to see the end of route 66,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/95sheilar
40,Busy and crowded,Tons of people! Really popular attraction. Bathrooms were really clean given the amount of visitors in the area. Lots of entertainers and singers on the pier. We visited for about an hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anlof9
30,Not what expected.,Thought this place was about the ferris wheel and some decent restaurants. More like a fair with all kind of cheap stuff to purchase. The amusement park (t) looked like fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Martur1
40,Santa Monica,"Lovely place, not just the Pier but the hole Santa Monica. The best place in Los Angeles. Beach, Shopping, places to go for a run, a beautiful Boulevard, lovely restaurants and coffee stores.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmilioBianco
50,Beautiful Cute spot!,I like how they put it in altogether there. many restaurants and amusement park! Lovely to visit area and chill on the beach 🌊,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hotnina79
30,No handicap/accessible access. Hard to get to pier.,The pier had lots of people milling about. Hard to access if you have trouble walking. Have to cross over a bridge and it is an uphill pull going back. Couldn't find any accessible access. Once on bridge there are souvenir vendors and places to eat. There are musicians playing for tips. There is a Ferris wheel and a few amusement rides. It does have great views of the beach and water with places to sit. It was a nice experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W7549ZCkarenb
50,Top of the world,Riding the Ferris wheel and eating fast food on the Santa Monica Pier while listening to live music is a quintessential experience to have when visiting LA even if it is just for 24hrs. We caught the hop on hop off red bus from Broadway which maximised our access to city sites and which allowed us to take time to visit great places like Santa Monica's Pier at our leisure.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/462joannef
50,Great to tread the famous boardwalk,We stopped off here to catch the atmosphere of the pier and it didn't disappoint with its entertainers and food outletsSpent a few hours taking in the amazing ocean views and entertainment,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fluffybellybutton
20,"Noisy, busy and full of people trying to take your money","Ok, only went to the pier because of the Connelly book, the reversal and being Close wanted to following in the footsteps of the book and get a feel,for myself. Just what I expected from a pier, noise, stalls and poor food. Maybe it's my age, but this is no longer fun, perhaps 40nyears ago.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/weechancer
50,Another tick off the bucket list... do it!,"The great Santa Monica Pier... recommended by so many friends, I didn't know what the fuss was about until my visit. The Pier was huge! Restaurants, an amusement park, little bistros and stalls selling souvenirs and treats. Buskers plying their trade, people fishing off the pier, swimmers riding the waves. Even the Police Station at the end of the Pier was interesting. Lots of people playing on the sand, would have loved to stay to watch the sunset if not for catching my flight out that night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sc-tadoc
50,Great spot,We love the pier. Reminds us of so many movies. There is a great vibe there. We stayed at Venice Beach which was a nice stroll down to the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicolea384
50,One of my Favourite Spots in LA,"This is one of my favourite locations in LA! The Pier itself is pretty good, but what makes it so excellent is everything in the surrounding area. You have Beach, Muscle Beach, Vince Beach, Shopping, Food, Craft Markets and so many sites from the movies.I really recommend hiring a bike from the pier and riding to Vince Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReviewBarracuda
40,Must see in Santa Monica,"We loved it here, especially the atmosphere. There are multiple stores to get your gifts and souvenirs and enough restaurants to fill your tummy. Make sure to try the roller coaster, it's not a record breaker but it's a unique experience to so this on a pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bartv630
40,Fun,"We went on a cold day.It was very nice to see the ocean, views and fisherman at the edge of the pier. We also took a stroll on the beach later on which was great with little kids",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I1755LYkarens
30,Nothing Special,I didn't think that it was anything special! Just a few tourist shops and boardwalk food. The parking sticks too and is expensive!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/22risat
20,Dated,"Unfortunately there was not much to do, rides were terrible and so was the arcade, it felt very out dated, we were at the pier for 15 minutes then headed back into town, don't set out an entire day for this as you will be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dafischer
50,Fun,Fun place to visitPlenty of dining optionsEasy walk from Venice beachBike ride also an option from Venice,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J3886RCangelah
30,Pretty good,"We visited on a weekday and no rides were on so was a little disappointing.However we still had a great day, and had a fantastic shake from the little ice cream parlour.Don't put $1 in Zoltar, he stole my money and didnt tell me my future :(",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alynta
30,"Honky Tonk? Yes, but that is Okay if that's what you are in the mood",I don't want to sound elitist. It is Honky Tonk but I visit it often. I like to listen to the music of the various musicians and they change a lot. I don't eat the food on the Pier -- there are so many things to try in the City. I like to do my people watching and I can't stop watching kids enjoy the entertainment and the games and the water.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Voyagerwithvoice
50,Santa Monica Pier,We visited Santa Monica pier on a nice sunny day. Easy walk from Venice beach. Small amusement rides. Nice views. Multiple cafes/restaurants nearby. Can use city sightseeing hop on-hop off bus to get here. Nice place to relax.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KirstyG958
50,Santa Monica Pier,"If you are in Santa Monica then it is a must to visit the Pier, which is famous throughout the World.After crossing over the footbridge that crosses the Pacific Coast Highway, which is an attraction all on its own, you can walk either around the beech or across it to get to the Pier.There are all the usual attractions, big wheel etc and plenty of eateries, but above all a very interesting walk along the Pier taking in the various sites and impromptu entertainment that takes place off and on . It also has a sign up stating that Route 66 ends there!!Good entertainment value for all the Family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/supafly
30,Day Out,"Nothing special, the rides are for small children. Not a great selection of food. The strip mall close by is excellent for food and more to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/485desm
40,Cool day but bustling with people ... gorgeous view of SoCal coast line,This is a pier overlooking a very long strip of SoCal that on a clear day you can see for mile .... it has the usual tourist traps of course but overall was a fun place to visit while we waited on our tour bus to leave. We spent over an hour just enjoying the scenery. On a hot day one could park and enjoy the beach as well. It was only 8 dollars to park for the entire day which is a bargain in any city .... that could change with seasons of course. The amusement park is quite small and more aimed at younger teens.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TraceyI33
40,Nice pier for everyone,"The pier is a place to go and spent some time to see, eat or entertain. It has something for every age. And offcouse have a look at the ocean and maybe spot some dolphins.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WimvL99
30,Great for a walk through...,"Crowded, great views of the city behind you and the Cali coastline... Lots of touristy shops, not high end at all.. An amusement park on site too, but didn't go, just looked at how quaint it appeared!! LOTS of bums sleeping in the area of park and grass surrounding the entrance, which was a bit odd, and disturbing.... seems to be a problem in many of the warm So Cal areas...But, anyway, a nice place to check out, but once is enough!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jpolo65
20,No early risers here,"A pier is a pier (unless it’s Chicago’s Navy Pier) especially if all the tourist traps and restaurants are closed. But, here ends US Route 66 so if you have to make a trip to the terminus, and you want to have something to eat or grab a souvenir check what times places open. Don't try to beat the crowd by arriving too early in the morning. (Midwestern thing I guess)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rbj2040
50,Good place to eat and ride,We arrived late afternoon and purchased tickets for the children's rides the attendants were really kind and helpful we only had five minutes until the children's rides closed but the attendants kept a couple open so little children could have a ride.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wendyalice
40,A must see,This is a must see as it is the end of route 66 ! In addition you have the Pacific park where you will have a good time. I recommend to try the Bubba Gump restaurant for a quick lunch or dinner.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StephaneL71
40,Happy and fun,The pier is a happy place full of music and people walking all over.There are some restaurants and a little park for the kids.The ocean view is beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PriscillaMeritello
50,Great Weekend Activity,"I love walking along the pier, getting some fresh air, people watching and then having lunch or dinner. You can't go wrong here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/642marlam
40,Fun place to people watch and bring the kids,"We arrived late on a cool Feb afternoon and this pier was quite busy. It has the usual tourist carnies and rides, but we found the street performers and people watching the best show here. Backed by a great ocean view this was a pleasant visit. We didn't the food here, it looked and smelled too touristy, but instead went to the nearby Erven restaurant for dinner (which was excellent).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Begreen
50,Great place,"Police cars driving up and down the pier with surf boards on the roof is a hoot, the place is great to take the family, roller coaster and Ferris wheel , heaps of places to eat and they still catch fish there ! We were in Santa Monica for 3 days and ended up there every day .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulBelyndaJosh
50,Beautiful!,My husband and I really enjoyed it. Parking was close and a fair price. Walking down the boardwalk was beautiful and had lots to do. Lots of street entertainment and vendors selling fairly priced and unique souvenirs. We rode the wheel and roller coaster at Pacific Park also. All of the staff were friendly and helpful. The beach was nice too. We stayed and watched the sun set and even saw a sea lion off the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H6773EQashleyd
30,Nothing to get excited about,Well it was for me. Pier was good and intact and forms the end of Route 66 so that made it interesting. Otherwise it was just the usual fair ground rides and attractions. Plenty of places to get food and drink. Parking nearby might be helpful for those who aren't staying nearby. Be aware of the number of homeless in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steve6244
50,Sideshow by the Sea,"Perfect place to escape the craziness of L.A.About 20 mins from Hollywood is this seaside Carnival. The Santa Monica Pier is the official end of Route 66 and the sign is out on the boardwalk.The boardwalk has all kinds of souvenir stores, food vendors and sideshows .It is fun, vibrant and a great place to hang out. The beach nice and the gym park right next to the pier is always full of people. Parking in the Santa Monica shoppping mall offer 90minutes free parking. Best spot for the iconic pier shot is on the left side of the pier down on the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessMTATravel
20,..,"We parked on the pier. When we were ready to leave I went to go pay for the ticket. I used my credit card to pay for it, but somehow it declined. Therefore, I paid with my debit and it went through. Today, I checked both of my bank and they charged me the parking fee on my credit card and debit card. I was charged TWICE!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meol2017
30,At least it is there,"I am 70 and grew up in L.A. Basically the pier is the same as 60 years ago with modern lights. Great just to be there but nothing special. Parking is difficult and rides are cheesy. In my opinion, it is better to just walk on the paths.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMasonNashville
30,Overpriced carnival,Employees weren't pleasant and the prices were steep. It was surprisingly clean though. The beach was beautiful!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/27sherrib
50,Good place to relax and unwind,We walked along the pier quite early in the morning and already the street performers and stalls were setting up. Was nice and sunny with nice views. Something you should definitely do while in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kkadam90
50,Great,Went here on our recent visit to LA a great day out had lunch at bubba gumps excellent food and friendly staff worth a visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D3743MTjamese
40,Nice place,We liked the Santa Monica Pier a lot. The livemusic there is great and the sunset awesome. We did the beachealk to venice beach which is just a mile. Very beautiful,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jen_worldwide
50,A Pleasant Walk on the Pier,"Exploring the Pier on a perfect weekday morning is a slice of heaven. With excellent views of Santa Monica, her expansive beach and Venice beach to the south, the musicians and vendors set up their booths and the arcade staff tune video and pinball machines and get prizes ready. The Pier hums with productivity. Typical food choices (tacos, funnel cakes, ice cream, coffee, etc.) plus a nice sit-down resto at the far end of the Pier. Paid parking (on the Pier itself and below on asphalt) is plentiful, convenient and reasonably-priced. Historical plaques tell the history of place in re. surfing, fishing, coastal activity. It is the Western end of Route 66. And on the beach below is the Original Muscle Beach. Well worth a morning stroll.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelenG449
50,A great place to unwind,"We went here on the last week of December and it was a sunny day but got chilly at night. We really enjoyed our visit here and had a great view of the sunset. The place is packed with people, tourists and locals hanging around just enjoying the ocean view and seabreeze. One of the many places I love to come back again because of the ocean. Worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prettylobster
50,Fun for all ages,"Walk in the sand, ride the carousel, grab some good eats or just sit and watch the waves. The pier offers fun for all. It's a throw back in time AND the end of the famous Route 66! You can play in the arcade and grab some ice cream as well. Enjoy this very special place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeborahF170
40,Great Pier with a very nice Buzz,"The pier is excellent for a walk to enjoy sunset and the music played through few musicians. We have loved our afternoon walk during our short visit to Santa Monica. highly recommended, needs a bit of maintenance but in general, great place to be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheTravellerFork
40,The end of the Mother Road,"I had always wanted to drive Route 66 but my wife felt that the journey would be too long. So with a son living in San Francisco we opted for flights to New York and then Las Vegas, road trip around Nevada/Arizona/Utah, Death Valley/Yosemite ending in San Francisco. After a couple of weeks with our son we set off for Los Angeles for our final week. All in all approximately the same road distance travelled as if we had done Route 66! However I did get to stand at the end of the Mother Road and have the pictures to prove it. The pier is a busy bustling place by day or night. The entertainment ranging from German rock group to ""Rock & Roll Jesus"" to country to classical guitar and violin depending on the time of the day. Fast food outlets by the score, restaurants to tempt you in from the hot unshaded walk along the pier and tourist stalls selling hats, pictures, postcards etc An obligatory funfair with blaring music and at night a garish light show, If you come off this pier without spending anything then you have more willpower than the average person.This is tourist trap heaven, but then why come here if you don't want to be treated like a tourist?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whiskers51
50,A must visit,You can't really give this place a miss! The pier has so much to offer with its own amusement park on it!Along the way there are various places to sit down and have a meal with many gift shops along the way.Walk down to the end of the pier and you may be lucky enough to spot the local and ever so friendly seal who was more than happy to put on a show for the crowd!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elleare
40,Fun Pier!,"One of my favorite pier for a hang out. This pier offers some real cool shops, delicious lobster & beer and some spectacular view of the Pacific! And if you get lucky, you can enjoy some cute seals playing in the water! It does get crowded but who loves a barren or lonely pier either :) Loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X5095STas
50,Romantic @ Night Fun During the Day,"Catch this during the day and you can shop the little shops, listen to bands, and people watch all day!At night there's no better place to catch a beautiful sunset!!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/511dawng
10,Tacky,"Stupid, dirty, bad entertainmentSmell of urine all around. Homeless seemed to live with their stuff, nothing good here. Was expecting beautiful views and local talent. Need to change for sure",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glennbell50
30,Go for End of Route 66,"I went to Santa Monica for the beach, not the pier, although it looks like a fun, family-friendly place full of games and a ferris wheel, etc. The repeating music drove me a bit insane (I went as far down the beach as possible to avoid the string/electronic repeating version of ""Closer"") and I didn't want to spend any money—I mainly just wanted a beach day. But it was still worth the visit! The end of Route 66, iconic, sits on the Pier, and since I'm from Chicago, that's well worth the visit. If you're looking for cheap postcards and trinkets to take home or send off to relatives, this is also a good place to go, but if you're just a tourist who mainly plans to be on the beach like I was, still worth walking up for the nice sign marking the end of the Route.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/847leahv
50,Fun environment!,"Went here on a chilly day not by choice but it was still fun. Lots of people watching, rides for kids and kids at heart, little shops, good food and right at the ocean. Beautiful views and awesome vibe from all of the surroundings you take in. Fun to be here even when it's chilly or cloudy, as there are games, food, shopping and vendors to entertain you. Definitely a must see for anyone new or returning people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryRN06
40,"Amazing place to be, the end of Route 66!!","So iconic, the very end of Route 66!! So pretty and they have done a fantastic job rebuilding this iconic structure! Shops, restaurants and the historical ""The Sting"" carousel, it is truly a place to visit! Reasonable parking, beach, sand, sun, fun, food, people-watching, attractions, all in one place, a must-see! Immerse yourself in the California atmosphere here!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HGF001
20,Old fashioned pier with fairground rides and cheap touristy shops,"The pier is nice to look at from a distance but it's a bit tacky, with cheap touristy shops and fairground rides. For UK travellers, think old fashioned beach resorts like Blackpool!Not really my scene but it gets busy so it must appeal to some!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thecalveley
40,Route 66,We mostly came here to see the end of Route 66 sign. A picture is a must!We didn't go into the funfair but it looked like it had enough rides to entertain you.There were several little shops selling trinkets along the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissL219
40,Very crowed but the place to be,Cool place with street musicians and artists ;) The amusement parc is in top condition and also quite nice to see but the prices are a little bit too expensive but you know nothing's for free ;) But for a short visit it is quite worthy ;),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicolase987
50,A nice place to visit,"This is a fun place to visit and walk around. I rode the Ferris wheel to get some great pictures of the beach and surrounding area. Grabbed a bite to eat at a hamburger stand near the Ferris wheel, not that great, but I got to sit down with some nice folks from South Africa who were visiting and talk with them for a bit. Took a few minutes to go sit on the beach and relax. Visited the bike rentals on the other side of the pier and rode my bike along the beach to visit Venice Beach. That was the best part of my trip. I highly recommend renting a bike. I could have rode for miles and got to see so much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cbellhr
50,Beautiful Sunset,"The pier is very busy, but nice. Wonderful place to watch the sunset and the people. Enjoyed spending time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eiji0088
30,"Yah, seen it, don't need to go back.",I wish I didn't use a full afternoon of our trip to go to this area. So touristy and full of questionable characters and cheap food. Walk up a few blocks to eat and shop - 3rd street is a more worthwhile place to spend your dollars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmyCCalgary
50,Don't Miss the Piet,"There is so much to see on the pier. Buskers, food, stalls, the ocean and the fun fair. No treip to Santa Monica is complete without the pier. Then head to 3rd Avenue for cafes and great shopping. Perfect day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heawil
40,Good place to hang out,I used to hang here quite a bit when I was living in Santa Monica. There's always a good mix of people and artists to watch. Eat and drink at the Bubba Gump Shrimp restaurant! And take a skateboard down the hill :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zooksplace
50,Different place,"I never thought that I could stay in the beach and at the same time inside the amusement park. Also, Santa Monica Pier is the end of the famous Rote 66 and you can enjoy some good restaurants too, like Bubba Gump Shrimp.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/616magdaf
50,Sunrise & sunsets,"I guess this is the best place to meet the sunrise with cup of Stabucks coffee, and be prepared to memorize the picture when Pacific ocean will drive the surfers next to you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teddykgbs
40,Iconic,Visited here on part of a tour I was on and was looking forward to the visit as I have seen this iconic spot on many tv shows and movies. So great to see it in real life. Unfortunately for us we were on a strict time frame and were here before the rides were open. Will have to return next time I'm in LA later in the morning. The rides look perfect for children of all ages. There is something for everyone. The attraction its self is essentially free if you are not going on rides or consuming food. A great place to stop and take photos if you have the chance and the access. There are public toilets nearby which is always useful when your on the move.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ainsleeash
50,Lovely Pier,"As one of ending points of Route 66 trail, it's not just like the other pier, this place offers too many attractions that makes it very attractive enough to all travellers who make a visit to Santa Monica. From the sceneries, eateries, activities, entertainments and so on, you just can find at this location. It makes Santa Monica Pier is a lovely-a-must visiting place to be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JCFave
40,Perfect for our 7 and 10 year old,My two older girls loved this place. We did go back in the evening and it was more crowded which was hard to navigate with a two year old in tow. Not sure how it would be for kids over ten but mine could have stayed all day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L5746AGsarahf
50,Beautiful,"Whole town of Santa Monica is beautiful, for me the most beautiful part of Los Angeles. The Pier is the end of the famous Route 66 so you must take a photo with the sign, come during the week or in the morning because it is really crowded on weekends",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/umahanamicko
40,A must do while in LA area,Can be crowded and parking can be a difficult depending on what day you visit and the weather. The weather was cloudy so not as much people but still very busy. You can see live music from local artists on the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelleo432
50,Good 'ol days!,"We got a free ride on the Metro for the day so we decided to take the Expo Line to the end by the Santa Monica Pier. The ride was great. A little crowded but not bad. Beats driving then trying to find parking by a long shot!Anyway, the pier itself is a classic among piers. Harkens back to the '50s when the world was innocent and life was uncomplicated. You have your street vendors and artists there vying for your attention and money to sell you their tasty treats or trinkets. It gets a bit crowded in the afternoon, but you can find solace in a corner here and there. If you're an adventurer, then the ferris wheel is for you! We're not, so we didn't. Eating establishments and shopping are only a few steps away too!All in all, it was a great day to spend an afternoon or day strolling down memory lane!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AFonger
50,Amazing pier!!,"Amusement park, restaurants and great people watching. The SaMo pier has it all. Take the day and walk to the end or spend some times on the rides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wavcra
40,For young and old,"You feel like a kid on the Santa Monica Pier. It is wonderful. Everyone has fun, everyone is laughing. Take a stroll, a ride, a drink or grab some Food. And if you didnt know: the Santa Monica Pier is the end of Route 66 :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/461agah
40,"Fun activity, with mini amusement park...food and fun!!!","We drove out here and spent a half a day walking on the pier, riding a few rides and then taking a walk on the beach. We went in the off-season so clearly it would have been much more busy, but we were able to park on the pier so it was a short walk to the everything. We enjoyed the spectacular views from the pier and all the shops and restaurants on the pier.We rode the Ferris Wheel to get some better views, only about a 10 minute wait so that was great news.Overall, it was a nice half a day to spend in Southern California!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Swaggger007
50,End o Route 66,"Ok so we didn't travel all the way, just the last few yards, but its the end that counts, lol. Its a great place for people watching and buying souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flatcapman12
50,Fun for all ages!,I lived in LA years ago and I always enjoyed the pier any time of the year. Great restaurants and local scenery short walking distance away. This past May my family and I spent a few days enjoying LA and my little boy enjoyed the pier more than anything else. The rides were awesome and so were the games throughout the park. If visiting LA it should be on your list and you get to walk around beautiful Santa Monica as well. The promenade is a right up the street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DetourRoatan
40,A great view,This is one of my favorite place in Santa Monica. Staying by the beach and seeing people having fun on the rides makes me feel relax. My teens enjoyed the rides. The air is refreshingly cool. There's ample parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KSM888
40,Concerts,"Any season place, but definitely need to experience the concerts. Good music, cool crowds, great atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/606MarkG
50,great place,"lots of fun. the end of route 66. the legenderary road that starts from Chicago. On the road book by Jack Kourack. The panoramic wheel is solar activated, it was updated few years ago",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/divinaRome
40,The Santa Monica Pier Finally,"It was surreal to be there as I had seen it on TV, films, pictures, etc. Arrived before 10am and was able to locate a good parking spot and we spent time at the pier and beach. We would have stayed longer than 2 hours and will come back at night to take in the lights, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H3963HUmarka
50,Great atmosphere at the weekend,Plenty to do and many restaurants was good to visit the end of route 66 and walk out over the Pacific ocean,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hazels2013
40,A must see,Great view of the Pacific Ocean. We ate lunch at the Mexican Restaurant at the end of the pier. The waiter took a picture of our family and brought it back to us in a frame to remember our trip by. We were on a cross country trip from Louisiana to California just stopping everywhere and this was just a bonus. Lots of activity on the pier and places to eat so you do have options. Weather was awesome. Water was cold! Too cold for me. I got in up to my calves and that was it for me. But had to get a picture of us in the Pacific. Make sure to bring a camera.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YoBob536
40,Family fun will cost you,"Quite a few things to do and see, though it won't come cheap. Rides and games are expensive, lots of people on weekends. A few restaurants, sweet shops, large game room and more. Paid parking, winter costs less ($6), summer is more. We enjoy the aquarium, small but educational.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlM338
50,Just a happy vibe..,It is as you expect it.. Wood pier. Nice beach. Touristy restaurants... But the smiles. Had a blissfully relaxing time just taking it in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/481shaund
40,Good fun!,"If you're anywhere near Santa Monica pier you have to go for a stroll on it just to say you've done it! It's pretty, has rides for the kids,and plenty of food choices. It's also the end of the most famous of roads Route 66!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/niksimic69
40,"A bustling, fun place to visit","My travel friend was amazed by the weekend crowds on the pier . The people watching is great, the views of the California coastal area is outstanding, the ocean is very scenic, and the amusements and tourist shops are really fun. We truly enjoyed our weekend time there. If you can, try to enjoy the sunsets if the weather is cooperating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulAK2011
40,Classic California,We met my long lost cousin for a great evening of fun and conversation. Great food and entertainment options.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/375philp

50,"Loved Los Angeles, Santa Monica","I went to Santa Monica several times during our stay in Los Angeles and we loved the vendors, waves, water and people. Many vendors and fascinating people/places to see. I can't wait to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Experience543232
50,Great fun,"This is a must visit especially with children, saying that who doesn't love a Ferris wheel. It's a great way to spend an afternoon and has restaurants/bars so you can have lunch, there is something for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnsonJ3
50,Iconic and fun,What an amazing throw back in time. What's more eye popping than a Ferris wheel at waters edge. The walk to the pier is amazing and once you've arrived you're treated to a blast from the past amusement park. Also expect good live entertainment and great places to dine. Truly a very fun and entertaining day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eczyoski
50,Something for everyone on Santa Monica Pier,"We visited some exciting places on the west coast and east coast of USA however Santa Monica Pier was a real surprise. It is not to be missed because there is something for everyone. Musicians, of which I am one, can be absorbed by the live musical performances. The day we were there, we enjoyed a quality opera singer, an accomplished violinist and a band made up of an entire family, the youngest appearing to be aged about 8yrs. They belted out ""you better find somebody to love"" and the notes soared above the sound of the waves and the seagulls and the excited crowd. So many people visit the pier that the in crowd is separated from the out crowd to avoid congestion. The pier is the end of route 66 and there are plenty of souvenirs by which to remember this. Many came to swim and sunbake but tens of thousands come each day to experience the excitement, eat from one of many yummy food outlets, or just lick an ice cream as the sun goes down. We also met some war veterans with a sobering message. They were men of principle and courage, pointing out the futility of war in an area that could easily have been immersed in mindless patriotism. They had a section of the beach covered in red and white crosses, representing tens of thousands of lost comrades. ""You got courage"" I offered and the vets said they appreciated their local council for allowing them to be there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnsA5126AC
50,Stunning,"Santa Monica pier and beach are great. Lots of things happening, rides, vendors and food.Awesome for families, friends, couples - must visit while in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xNermisa
20,Underwhelming...,"I've visited this place whenI was younger, and it seems to be a tourist stop for everyone visiting the area. However, I was very underwhelmed. I'll first start off with the positives of the pier. First, the view of the ocean is beautiful. The pier itself is a great view too. There is a room at the beginning of the pier where a carousel is located. It's a very old one and it's an interesting place to explore. Other than that, the pier consists of some odd characters that consist of street peddlers and tourists. The shops consists of cheap ""beach"" clothing and other souvenirs. There's a few restaurants that seem okay (Bubba Gumps).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/897carleyr
40,Beautiful beach side fun place to spend a whole day with family!,It's an amazing walking experience with the wind from the sea blowing into your hair and you can see people from all our the world having a good time with all the restaurants and fun rides!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AjayB2205
50,Our daughters loved it!!!,"Since I was very young, I've been going here, if you're from out of state this place is a must!!! Don't miss the opportunity",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/easycastello29
40,Nice attraction,A bit cloudy when we were there but didn't detract from a lovely morning out. Nice views and some good attractions,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cricketdad
40,Enjoyable walk,"Nice place to walk and enjoy the view of the beach. We parked a few blocks away and walked down, also enjoyed the nearby street markets with beautiful raspberries and strawberries for sale.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicoleS310
30,"Been There, Seen It But No Need To Return","To begin with, the positives are the price of parking. At only $2 per hour up to a max of $10 per day, I consider it very reasonable for a tourist trap.Biggest reason to visit is probably the start/end of Route 66, plus it was a pleasant walk out over the beach.Other than that it is not overly well maintained, lots of expensive and tacky trinket shops, amusements, restaurants and buskers.The water views and surrounding scenery is great, but the ambiance on the pier was poor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gla_Rangers
40,Lots of Fun!,"Lots to do at the Santa Monica Pier! Rides, restaurants, shops, walking, and the beach! This was our first time visiting the Pier, and it was a gorgeous sunny day. We walked down the entire Pier and took in all the entertainers and musicians, then walked along the beach. It was pretty cool as there were many people doing acrobatics and working out on bars and poles. Was quite entertaining! We also stopped along the shops as there were lots of spots for souvenirs. We found 3 hour parking which was perfect for us as we arrived around 1 pm. I would highly recommend to visit the Pier if you've never been! Its a must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JillianF674
30,Seedy!!!,"Santa Monica Pier has obviously seen better days!Nothing much more than cheap, junk souvenirs, a few ""buskers"" and a couple of eateries, as well as the fair-ground rides. Highlight of our visit was realizing that Route 66 began/ended at the pier!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annev781
40,Santa Monica Pier ... the end of The MOTHER Road - Route 66,"As a musician, I decided to visit this place for all nostalgic reasons. In fact, I took time to show the kids the different versions of Route 66 - with the CARS (cartoon movie) clip an excellent introduction.After spending time to go through the song, the sing along, showing documentary of Route 66, the kids have grown to like the song.When I stood before the sign, I felt a stronger connection to the song as I have traveled to some of these places named on the song. The song was no longer part of the American songbook but part of my life. I guessed that my wife knew it as she volunteered to take picture of the sign with me (without the family). Now, Route 66 has became part of my life. Flagstaff Arizona, Kingsman, Barstow, San Bernardino.... ...It felt strange to be at the end of the road but thankful to be part of this rich history.The Santa Monica pier was not too busy when we were there. There were 2-3 buskers sharing their gift of music. One of them caught my attention as he sang his guts out though there weren't many who paid him his dued attention.There were number of eateries and souvenir shops. The screams from the nearby theme park helped to add some buzz to the area. Walking to the edge of the pier, you would be greeted by a lovely beached who kissed the ocean in nearby horizon. The day was bit hazy and sun was hiding behind the clouds. But there is something about the ocean, the beach and the sky that released some sense of freedom.I love these vibes and could spend my afternoon people watching, listening to the busking and helping myself to the churros. We walked to the end of the pier where there were few restaurants and a gift shop.In front of me was a horizon as far as my eyes could see. Pacific Ocean held the skies along the horizon. The sky was dark and thus not too hot.Though you feel that it was tad ""touristy"" but do not miss this part of history. This pier has grown old with the city of Angels and I was glad to find some old charm mingled in the magic of ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bkobog
30,Very touristy,"The Pier is nice for a stroll, but it's very touristy and a bit tired. Not really what I was expecting. It was good to see it, but absolutely no need to ever go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/musicxdesign
30,You gotta come here at least to see it!!,"This place is iconic....and very crowded, especially on the weekends. But if you are visiting from outside the area, you just have to take a walk on the pier. For people watching, and ocean watching. It's a great place to spend some time on a warm summer's day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/203carync
20,Boring...,"..., at least on a grey day, and frankly it only deserves 2/5 for the nice walk we had on the boardwalk from Venice Beach to get here...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/744olep
40,Very busy on Saturday,Large crowds on sunny weekend days. Historical location with many movies filmed there. Was very surprised to see a Pacific seal over the edge of the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jimsz65
50,A perfect gem in LA,This place is a must see. We where there in a cloudy day. But still good. The shopping is good and the feeling of the area is good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/982jann
30,I wanted more...,"We visited Santa Monica Pier in winter and was a little disappointed. The views were great and there were no queues for any of the rides. Being winter may have contributed to the lack of atmosphere. The roller coaster attendants were nice and friendly, but the staff in the little shops along the pier, seemed to be a little bothered by our presence. A few good things and a few bad things made the experience just average.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jelette
50,Great place for all,Great place to visit. The pier has a few restaurants and souvenir shops. There are people set up long the pier singing and painting amongst other things. Beautiful beaches as well. Parking is available on the street with meters but I recommend parking on the pier. The pricing is reasonable and you are a couple of steps from the entertainment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kp1128
50,Great fun,"Enjoyed strolling up the pier. It is very busy and full of tourist stuff but is enjoyable. Loved the big wheel and roller coaster - $8 each, you ride the coaster twice and get plenty of time on the wheel with some great views. Plenty around for coffee, snacks or a meal. Loads of other smaller rides and games. A fun hour and a half.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliG1620
40,Had to do it!,"It's a Tourist Must! Get a photo, etc. Great Volkswagen Cruise in while we were there. Musicians on the Pier, great vibe. Never knew Route 66 ended at the Santa Monica Pier. Good Trivia to-know!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimtL4374BP
50,Fun!!!,It's amazing how a Pier has so much to do! We came and ride the Ferris wheel (it's $8/person) to ride but it was well worth it to just enjoy the beauty of the water and the serenity of the waves at the top.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jtereese
20,"Tourist trap, go if you must",Supper toursity. There are so many better places to visit in L.A. Visit this place only if you need to do so in order to fulfill some sort of dream of yours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattkurth
30,You Have to Experience it,"It was a pretty cool place, make sure you walk the whole pier. Lots of different people and cool activities to do on the pier, make sure you ride the little roller coaster and have fun at the arcade",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KylefromWindsor
50,Always a good spot for food and fun,I've been to the Santa Monica Pier numerous times. It's fun during any season but it was a little less crowded when I was there in March (as opposed to summer). We had no problem finding parking and the wait at Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. on the SMP wasn't bad at all. This is also a great area to take pictures since the beach is a nice background. Pictures also look lively and fun with the Farris wheel in the background. It's nice to sit and relax in the area too. We stayed in Malibu and drove up for the evening and it was perfect.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pinkbabyadventure
20,eh,"For the hype that people give it and the stigma that surrounds it, I was let down. It was not as good as expected and nothing which entertained the adults or the kids too much. Best thing there was seeing bubba gump from Forrest Gump.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bhadbritnee
40,Nice pier with amusements and a beautiful carousel,"This is a very touristy pave but fun to go to. Check out the beautiful carousel in the merry go round building. The horses are so beautifully painted and it's just such a fun atmosphere. There are other amusements,rides,restaurants to visit as well. Then walk down Santa Monica Boulevard and the promenade for window shopping. There is also a beautiful park located close by which is worth seeing or sitting for a rest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/690kime
50,Well worth piering!!!,"Our first visit for both of us , left us with an enjoyable experience overall. Like most tourist places it has become very commercialized and some what tacky. I rember watching movies when I was young that showed its uncommercialsed persona and its a shame I did not get to experience those times. That said its a great stroll to the end with beautiful views on either side of the beach. Of all the commercial activities the ferris wheel is worth it for the views you get. If you want to eat try the many restaurants in Santa Monica itself as those we saw on the pier were expensive fast food. A must whilst you are there is to have your picture taken at the end of Route 66 sign. One last thing try visiting during the week as at weekends it gets very busy. Overall an enjoyable experience just wished we had visited many years earlier to see it when it was less touristy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neil-1138
50,Sublime!....with a *,"I love this pier! But, only in bits....it has been a tourist staple for decades and continues to draw the crowds...herein lies my issue.....too many.....cars and people. Being a product of its success, the pier attracts huge weekend and summer crowds. To enjoy your experience here, try a weekday....it is the same ocean any way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W8495JLmichaelg
50,You havent been to LA if you haven't been to the pier,"Its just superb people watching- from barely dressed in line skaters to tourists to ladies who lunch- the pier has it all. You can choose from a number of good restaurants near-by ( reservations advised most places) or just stroll the passing crowd along the beach.. Its just a traditional piece of California culture ( if anything is traditional in California),",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/couplessPS
50,"Really Cool, Touristy Place",The Santa Monica Pier is a great place to visit for anyone but I think it's also a great place for a date. I went with a group of friends and had a good time. It's definitely a cool sight to see as I have never seen a pier anything like it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/516nicholask
50,Cant help but make your heart tingle.,"There is just something about Santa Monica Pier that makes your heart tingle, and you cant help but smile. A must do stop, even if you don't ride the rides, its worth the wander down. I did a round on the Ferris Wheel and the view was divine, and the sea breeze is amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdventuresofRach
50,Fun spot,"The pier is worth seeing if you are in the area. A great beach with a lot to do and a nice trail to walk/bike. Very close to public transportation, shopping, and yummy places to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tnab
40,Worth a walk,"The pier contains a mini carnival, street artists, and a Mexican restaurant. It's a short walk, but it's worth it for the experience. Try going at night when the pier lights up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rccampbelljr
40,A nice walk on a sunny day,"The pier offers an amusement park, some niche shops, and a tremendous amount of people watching. We had a great time just walking out the pier and back on a beautiful December day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FormerHockeyMom
40,Iconic Landmark,"The Santa Monica pier is an iconic landmark as it has appeared in countless films and television shows. I remember the first time I came to Los Angeles, it was my first time seeing the ocean and I was in awe with the pier and the also iconic Bubba Gump restaurant with the Forest Gump bench.Having lived in Santa Monica for years now since my first visit, I would still say it's a spot worthy to visit if you're in town.The pier has a somewhat outdated arcade, theres a few restaurants on/ along side the pier. There is a gift/specialty shop at the end of the pier with Route 66 and other Santa Monica/ Los Angeles souvenirs. There are also some historical facts and photos towards the end of the pier if you're interested in its past.I would say the pier deserves a visit, but once is enough :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/760diaj
30,Crowded but worth the visit,"We were in Santa Monica for a day and after driving through LA I wanted a fun, relaxing stop in SM. Did the ferris wheel at Pacific Park, did the walk, got our picture at the end of Route 66 sign after driving it which was a must but other than that, nothing too special and crowded with tourists. We were going to eat nearby but decided against it and drove to Malibu. The walk on the beach was nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/khrys_2117
40,Walk before dinner at the lobster,"Windy and a little chilly at night in October but a great place to Visit at night. Lights from the ferris wheel, street performers and tourist gift shops were all a thing to look at. I love Cali!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y965THamandam
50,Fun,"We came to walk around, and hopefully hit up a coaster, but most of the rides were shut down. Great place for kids, and having a bite to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllenAhi
40,Cool for a quick visit,"Went as a couple for our 2nd anniversary. Went at night and it was cool to see everything. Basically walked to the end, came back to the rides area. We did the Ferris wheel that was cool to get some good views. Gotta go once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/403dean
30,"Not bad, but man the singers there suck!","Took a group of Chinese tourist there and good that they did not speak English because the vendors that were singing were horrible, we wanted to pay them just to stop! Nice place to tour around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ranbud
30,"Noisy, holiday ambience","Santa Monica Pier is an excellent place to enjoy the sea and the sunset, and some of the musicians playing are really worthwhile listening to. But with the Mexican restaurant at the end of the Pier being closed ... just a short visit I would say. Still nice to hang out and dream away in the warmth if the sinking sun while listening to the sounds around you when you are in the mood to just hang out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/97maartenb
50,Amazing as always,Santa Monica pier has the best amazing beach in LA. It's best to catch up little early but gives you the best view .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rabisaha
50,Too busy!!,"Eugh dooo busy you have to fight your way along it.Go see it once...that's all you need!!Felt safer in Venice, it's the new Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AWilson321
40,Old fashioned & Crazy busy,"Another iconic thing to do in Santa Monica. We were very fortunate to have been staying two blocks away and so got to see this place in all her moods. Generally though, unless you come here early morning, it's gonna be crazy busy to get in (I mean literally queuing and walking at a snails pace to get in or out). The fun fare is definitely an iconic thing to see and photograph but really, it's like any other old fashioned pier, you get out what you put in. Lots of souvenirs to be had, the Route 66 officially ends here too and we saw plenty of musicians/bands/performers. Good to wile away a half hour or so at a time. I've enclosed pics of our first day on the pier, when it was so foggy and hazy, you could barely see anything! We also walked past early morning and I snapped a rare shot of it in quiet mode.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Muirsontour
40,Great for sunset pictues!,"We were here at the beginning of February and it was kind of cold and very windy. So make sure you wear the proper clothes. We walk around the place and then got this awesome pictures of the sun set. Parking lot is big, but you have to pay for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/96melissav
50,Great for people watching!,"Really enjoyed wandering up and down the pier. As you would expect, lots of souvenir shops and places to eat, with amusement park rides that have great lights after dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/howitstacks
50,Amazing sunset!!,Beautiful place and very much enjoyed the visit; and a beautiful pier and attractions for the entire family. Well worth it to escape the madness of LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daveofthefinn
50,Great place to watch the sunset!,One of the best places to watch the sunset! There's also entertainers to enjoy and carnival activities.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phantom1020

40,Loved it!,Pier was fun with great views! Loved the pier and ocean/beach scene with the mountains in the background! Expect to pay tourist prices!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nmarcum03
30,Classic must see when in LA. police need to rethink how they are serving the public.,I love walking the pier. great people watching. I witnessed someone overdosed by drugs unable to get up. He was 20 feet from the police office. At the end of the pier there was a police car beeping at the crowd to get out of his way so he could park. why do the police need cars on the pier? they would be better suited to be walking the beat helping those in need and not disturbing the tourists,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martinray2016
50,Awesome,"Awesome To see The most famous pier of all! There are street musicians, there is an trapeze school up there and of course plenty of options To eat and entertain. And see The sea!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/selvettav
30,Soggy California,Unfortunately we went when California was getting the most rain they have gotten in a long time so we did not get to enjoy the pier to its fullest but thankfully Bubba Gump Shrimp Co was open so we got to enjoy some drinks and stay dry!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lwojNY
30,Beautiful Views,"This is an iconic stop for anyone visiting Los Angeles. Yes, it is touristy but that is part of the fun. We came here early (10 am) on a Saturday morning in January so it was not busy at all when we arrived and we were able to find parking right by the beach area for only $8. I know parking can be a pain here so I was happy we arrived early. The pier is fun to walk around for about an hour or two and look at the vendors and shops. There was one vendor who paints your name using animals/flowers. We ended up getting one for each of my daughters and it was neat to watch how he did it. The part I enjoyed the most was just walking to the end of the pier and taking in the view. It really was beautiful to be surrounded by the Pacific Ocean with the mountains in the distance.The reason I gave this only 3 stars is because of the amount of trash on the beach around the Pier. There was litter everywhere which gave a negative aspect to the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emeli500
50,Lovely treat,"IF YOU WANT to people see, enjoy the beautiful beaches and take in some amazing walks, then come here.Enjoyed the pier and seeing everything they had to see and eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DarrylStewartThai
50,"Friendly, Family, Fun","Friendly, Family, Fun. Buskers, rides fortune tellers, you name it this pier has it all. While it's only a short walk plenty is packed in. Cafes, restaurants, candy stores. The views are breathtaking and the peace and calm of the sea is comforting. This is really a must and well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marlainac2015
50,A great old time amusement park,We were here during peak season between Christmas and New Year's and it did not feel crowded. If you have old time fall fairs in your past you'll feel very nostalgic here. There are all the arcade games as well as a Ferris wheel and merry-go-round. You can walk from here along the ocean to Venice Beach so it can be a day long experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dontSeattle
40,Fun visit,It was cold and windy on our visit to the pier but had a great time! Kids loved playing video games in the arcade and the merry go round was a fun way to end our visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jkmom
40,Fun quick stop!,"We rode up from Venice Beach, there were plenty of locations to lock our bikes. Pacific Park is free to enter, then you pay for rides & games. The Coaster was definitely fun, we paid for two rides each, but each ride traversed the Coaster twice, so that made it worthwhile. It was the only ride for my teenage daughter and I though, the rest were kids rides. The fete style games were fun but can get a bit pricey, and there aren't really a lot of them. There is an arcade too, which adds to the pier atmosphere, however we probably had four or five issues with games not working after we had put money in them, they are clearly not maintained well or are just very old.A nice stroll to the end of the Pier gives a great location to stop and have something to eat, especially at sunset, and enjoy the panoramic vistas. There are a couple of restaurants but expect to pay Tourist prices.There are lots of little artist stalls up and down the pier too, as well as the usual Tourist traps (magnets, keyrings etc). Save your money and take loads of pictures instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G6591NMsarak
50,Awesome,My favourite location in the states. The pier is fun for people of all ages and is located on an amazing beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JasonDoz
20,It was nothing special.,I was staying at a nearby hotel and went to the pier just to be able to say that I've been there. I went about 7pm. There was nothing there really - a few lights and some restaurants. Nothing special. I liked the Route 66 sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TommySangers
40,Buskers were awful but atmosphere was fun,"Iconic end of the road for Route 66 was a fun carnival atmosphere with people from across the world enjoying a slice of Americana. You can stroll around for free, shop for overpriced souvenirs, take in a bite at a number of unhealthy sips and suds places, and enjoy the sights and sounds of the beach. Was surprised by the horrible talent performing at various spots along the pier - would have thought that they could have found some talent in that area - but maybe it was the B team during January holiday breaks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IrishLady8
30,Nice to see...¯\_(ツ)_/¯,"The Pier was Ok, not breathtaking, enjoyed the scenery but not much to do. Walking around enjoying the views of the ocean and homes that sat along the coast was a treat,not many restaurants and people walking around trying to hustle you on buying or giving.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cbo411
50,Best views in town,"Best views in town and always something fun happening in this place, a place for all ages and a lot to doNot very cheap for food and attractions but great place to watch the sunset!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobW1111
40,Santa Monica Pier Gluten Free,"I only found 1 gluten free option and that was fries at the burger place on the pier. They were great, i added bacon on top.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/div2017
40,Fun place to see and hang out,"Great place to hang out with family and friends. We didn't go on the beach, but we did see an amazing sunset! Lots to do and family friendly! Likely more to do when it's warmer. Several restaurants but limited in allergen and vegan friendly (for me).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mmgaspar1227
50,Peace and fun at the shore,"Beautiful pier, a lot of manufactured things one can get at stores, and people from all over the world can be found there.The park is very simple as it comes to the rides, but still a nice place to go just for the fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RHurtado
50,can’t get better than this…,"We are from the east coast trying to avoid the cold and snow for a week. We aimlessly followed traffic on our way back from Palm Springs and surprisingly ended up at Santa Monica Pier. The bridge provided a separation from the hustling downtown onto a pier. Parking was amazingly easy. There were all kinds of roadside food stands, artists, vendors, and musicians on the pier; if you look far enough, your illusion may take you to Asia on the other side of the Pacific Ocean at the end of the pier. There was this wonderful musician playing guitar with all kinds of 70 R&R at the end of the pier, with a cool drink, looking at the Pacific Ocean, getting some sun in the middle of January, can’t get better than this…",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcusmQ9231FD
40,Fun to visit.,"Today was the first nice day in a while, and it was enjoyable just to walk out to the end of the pier, with a great view back toward Santa Monica's beachfront, and views up the coast toward Malibu and beyond. There were various people who were just set up and playing music for tips, who were pretty good. We didn't buy anything, so I can't speak to the food or amusement park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VeeLee4
30,Tourist Trap but kinda worth it,Its probably everything you think it is. Overpriced & crowded. BUT its the Santa Monica pier. id take any visitor here to check it out. it can be quite beautiful during sunset at the end of the pier!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnkO1168GV
50,Romantic Date,"Romance doesn't go well with me when mTraveling as it's always Business and too busy with clients but I had proposed this beautiful place for my friend's honeymoon, to include in his itinerary! It's truly a lovers beach and I enjoyed my stay! Love is all we need and hard to find it pure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lee8811
40,Definitely worth it,This place is just a must see for everyone visiting Los Angeles. It has a cozy vibe and the best view of the beach both ways. It's a popular place for both locals and tourists so expect a decent amount of people.Please do not hesitate to ask me about this place if u have any questions,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stefan-doering
50,Another must see when in LA,"You cannot visit LA and not visit the pierThe end of the trail...Route 66They have reasonably pruced souvenirs, coffee, restaurants and street hawkers and entertainers for the adults and plenty of the rides and arcade games for the kids or kids in you. Even had the fortune telling machine like the on in Big. Bubba Gump shrimp !Fish off the pier and there is even a cleaning area with a sink. Not sure about permits but many people there with their rods.Parking is ample. Depending on how you enter you can park for less near the beach or on the pier itself for more.Walk to the other side to the boardwalkGreat place to ride as well. Some pedestrians still decide to walk on the bike path so you may hear the odd cyclist voice his anger to get out if the way. There is plenty of room to wall without blocking them.Beaches looked cleaned and maintained.Washrooms are plenty but could be better maintained. Take you hygiene spray, seat cover etc.you can sit near the food courts or at the edge of the pier and look out towards the horizon.In the evenings and in winter it may be cool so a windbreaker would be good.Summer or winter a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalTraveler2020
40,Worth a stroll,Lovely illuminations on the Ferris wheel. Good atmosphere. The Mexican restaurant (Mariasol?) at the end of the pier is worth a visit too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F6828ITnicolah
30,Average,"The iconic pier a bit too chilly and windy during our visit. The attractions were not operating when we went ~10:30am. Maybe they open later in the day. Because of that, we didn't stay long and left to walk to Venice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JN789
30,Nothing special,The rides are nothing you would not see in a mall parking lot on a weekend. If you are looking to occupy any kids you may have go for it but it is not exactly the Brighton Pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V8471VQchriss
40,Don't miss for a walk.,"You can't miss this place especially with your family: fodd, attractions and fantastic view!There is also a parking close.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/881sandroc
40,As seen in the movies,"It's a nice place. We hit a very rainy day, so less fun. Still it's definitely worth a visit. Make sure to stop at the game joint :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DenitsaH2013
40,Old fashioned tacky fun and best view from big wheel,"Look it's a funfair not a theme park so if you set your expectations for cheesy rides, noisy sideshow games and candy, you should love it. It's definitely worth a look and as the headline says the view from the Ferris wheel is amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsWaterhouse
30,Nice,"The pier has a wide variety of things to do, the place has a really chilling music where ever you go, good restaurants, and a perfect view to the sea, i loved the arcade it was cheap and fun, the pier is a really nice place to go through.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lilmmbgames
50,Fun place to explore for a few hours...,"Didn't ride any rides. Just explored the shops, the restaurants, and enjoyed the atmosphere. Great people working the pier. And great people on the pier! A great place to enjoy people watching, whether it's the guys fishing, the street entertainers, or just the crowds!We visit here every time we are in the area, which is now becoming an annual event!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pinman59
40,Probably one of my favourite places ever.,"This is our second visit to America and with that second visit to Santa Monica Pier, my wife and I absolutely love it here, we had a lot of fun on the rides, played some skeeball. It's just an absolutely great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrbensonw
40,A must see for the view,"I enjoyed seeing this. The views were great of the pier, and the beach. Food was expensive and the homeless population was pretty big I thought but I would def go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KSteelRobinson
50,so beautiful,"It was beautiful! windy but warn! its $8 to ride the west coaster, you actually go twice around which makes the $8 worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samanthaovitt
50,Beautiful beach,"When I visited Santa Monica beach it was a really nice sunny day. The beach was clean and busy. I didn't see any litter as I have read in other reviews. I was approached by one homeless person. The only negative thing is the food places they have there. We ate at Bubba Gump as that seemed like the best choice they had. We had to wait around 50 mins for a table. Alot of the other food places didn't have seating. It was food like burgers, fish and chips. They could do with more restaurants. The car parks gets really busy there too, so it's best to get there early. The amusement park was good and reasonably priced. There are lots of small shops to buy souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V3661XNsoniar
30,Beautiful but expensive,Make sure you go just to take a walk and enjoy the scenery. It's very expensive and not worth it if /when you can drink it or eat it beforehand.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elenat190
50,i like it,",, nice walk , wonderful ice cream and we had lunch there in a sea food restaurant it was amazing a nice place , nice beach however it was cold in December ,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drengytantawy
40,Quintessential view,"Santa Monica is the quintessential beach view one sees in movies and television programmes. Unfortunately it was wet and cold when we were there, but we enjoyed the walk to the end of the pier, the Route 66 information (it is the end), the views and watching the birds. Hopefully we can visit another time in better weather.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/favourites
20,Nothing was open at 9pm on a Thursday,"Even though the website says it's open and the lights make it seem like the rides and restaurants are open, but by 9pm, not one restaurant or ride was open. Views are beautiful but much worse than Navy Pier in Chicago or other similar attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shelliu
50,Merry go round carousel was fun,"You might enjoy the carousel with your little ones. Our two year old always has a blast riding the animals; horse, pig or even a goat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dee_Green15
30,For tourists but beautiful vies,"Much like the warf in San Francisco, Santa Monica pier is dominated by souvenir stores and sweet shops but the views are gorgeous. The parking is cheap and close. It's a fun stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noni2lily
50,Pure enjoyment,Even though I don't do rides I love watching my friends be kids again and enjoy the rides. I loved walking the Pier and seeing families etc. Having so much fun and seeing Joy on others faces. The view is epic. Prices are reasonable. Listening to music and waves crashing and watching the sunset was enlightening and refreshing and made me feel relaxed. I definitely enjoyed my time here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RareBliss30
40,Night visit to the pier,"Although most things were closed, or shut down, I was still excited to be at the pier and see all that I did. I would definitely recommend coming here to others. I would love to come back in the summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Malachite10
40,It's what you see on TV!,"All shows about LA have a Quintessential beach boardwalk trip. Most of the time, you're seeing Santa Monica Pier. Get on the ferris wheel. It's a gorgeous view. And you're right near 3rd Street Promenade so you've got loads of eating drinking and shopping just nearby. I recommend parking somewhere near 3rd Street, not at the beach. It's cheaper.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marias111111
40,Night visit,Such a beautiful place by night. Maybe next time when we have more time a proper day trip. Even though raining and night time you can see why so many people are drawn to here,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mollygoeswild
50,Can I go back?,Bucket list item checked off. Nothing like the sunset from Santa Monica Pier. Easy subway ride from LA. Actually visited there twice while on business for a week in LA. I highly recommend,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Postalblue2010
40,Something Different,"One of those things to say you've done while in the LA area. Good place to watch people as well as the sunset. As expected, a madhouse on nice weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonCricfils
50,Must do,Definitely put this on your agenda when visiting Los Angeles. We loved the atmosphere and took some great pictures. Great for families or anyone really,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/641pamb
50,"Santa Monica Pier, California",Wonderful place to take a walk and to chill by the sea. A lot of gift shops and singers to stop and listen.Also good food at the restaurants on the pier.One of the most beautiful Piers I have been to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nikoz23
40,Huge crowds turn up in the afternoon,This is where Route 66 finishes and the beach begins. We visited the pier after lunch and there were not many people around. When we walked by later in the day people were turning up in droves for Pacific Park amusements. There were various buskers on the pier which were entertaining. Great views looking back across the beach to LA hills,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/106susanl
40,First time,"Had a great time here. Nice view of the water, cute shops for souviners. Great play ground area for small and big kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NCNJGIRLZ
40,Excellent choice to hang out in the afternoon,"If you want to hang out and chill any saturday afternoon this is the option, just walk and feel the sea air and relax, the rest of the local amenities are optional",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuisArmandrake
50,A night out,"Fabulous place..Beautiful at sunset. Lots of eateries.amusement park lights up the night.Crowded with friendly people, we even spotted our first celebrity..Joey Fatone from NSYNC",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hansonspec
30,Nice views,"It was nice to walk along the pier, good views along the beach a back to the hills. Along the pier there are buskers and performers, some of them were quite good. There are the usual stalls and amusement arcades with a few places to get food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoubleExpresso
40,Beautiful Day Trip,While staying in LA for a long weekend we drove to Santa Monica for the afternoon and it was just beautiful! We walked along the beach sidewalk and then down to the famous Pier. It was so relaxing to sit on the steps and look at the water. There is plenty to see and lots of eating spots too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMarie525
50,Very Nice Beach,"Ate lunch on the pier, shopped, watched the pelicans play, listened to music, fun day to walk on the pier and relax with family",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JerriV
50,great afternoon,"Don't go on your own. try the carrousel it was in the sting movie. we had cod n chips and a bear, looked around the old time amusements. All in all we loved this place, reminded us of the 60s in the UK.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stant0ns2014
50,Great fun!,We had a lot of fun at this old fashioned pier - great rides and ambiance that takes you back in time!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/13garyj
30,Tourist must see,"As a tourist, you should experience this pier, and at least take a group photo under the neon pier sign. Take a ride on the majestic merry go round, take a shot at the bumper cars, & don't forget the solar Ferris wheel",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noswitt
50,Never gets old,"Sooo much to do here - food, games and major people watching. Beautiful at ALL times of the day. Plan on spending the whole day if you can- walk from the pier south to Venice or north.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P2720WQmarier
50,A tourist must see,"The pier is iconic, with the Route 66 connection on display and a great place to stop and enjoy the view while listening to busking violinists at sunset before a seafood dinner. Got some of the usual souvenirs and hats for the kids. Will take my kids back for the amusement rides next visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenniferO1259
40,Good family place to go on a sunny day - Park on the pier itself for $2 an hour,"First time here. I made a mistake and parked 5 blocks away because the park ""scalpers"" near the pier on the beach front street wanted up to $20 to park. I did not realize that you can ""drive"" your car onto the pier itself and pay only $2 an hour, so do it and save yourself a lot of walking. There is a small amusement park with a ferris wheel and roler coast and some other smaller rides for kids. I enjoyed the street musicians who played a diffeent variety of music - spaced every hundred feet or so apart. You can watch the surfers along the south side and see the north LA mountains and beach on the north side",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jqgoode
40,Part of the LA Tour,Didnt have much time here as part of a tour and it was quite warm and very busy.It was good to say that we saw the peir and had a walk on the beach but it could have been Brighton or Bournemouth in the UK only hotter.Managed to see the end of Route 66 so worth the travel.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trebor5417
40,Fun even in the winter,"We ate at Rusty's and another seafood restaurant on the pier. Both had fresh inexpensive seafood. It was fun to walk over the water, listen to children laughing and listen to the occasional performer on the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanetandDeon
20,Not for the solo tourist.,"I hate to give it a bad review, I really do, but the fact that someone visiting on their own is not allowed to go on the rides because they are built for two or more is a real kick in the balls. I had my heart set on going on the ferris wheel but I was told I could not because I was there by myself. So my plans for getting some nice pics from the top were ruined. The rollercoaster looked awful though. It goes around for ONE lap and that's it. 20 seconds long!The arcade is quite good, but they could do with a bit more retro stuff. The staff were mostly brick-faced and emotionless too. I realize that this is not Disneyland but there's no need to be so sullen and cold.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/curiositykilledshawn
50,Great day for fun in the sun,I've been now multiple times to the pier and it never loses its attraction. My family enjoyed the the ferries wheel ride and the atmosphere here at the pier is marvelous. I can wait for more sunny weather to do this more often.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sabinee502
40,Great for a summer day,"The pier has a number of fun activities but i must admit i did not longer much cause i was more interested in taking in the coast during my run. all the same, i think it would be a nice place to spend more time in just for a bit of childish fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MKLusaka2014
30,"Ok, but not worth going out of your way for","Visited while on a Hollywood tour that we took out of Santa Monica while staying in Anaheim. Ferris wheel, small roller coaster, and other attractions including restaurants, carnival games too. Nice beach to overlook from the pier and ocean views. Or skip the pier and view from the beach. Over an hour drive from Anaheim to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariedesjardins
50,Pier,"The best of the best, just an amazing place we had a lot of fun also we booked bikes and played volleyball beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mais403
40,Go at sunset for great views,Definitely touristy but it was popular with the locals to when we went on Friday night. There are a few places for hot dogs/fair/carnival food but it's a great place to catch the sunset and watch people fish. We also opted to take a ride in the Ferris wheel. It was a little pricey but offered great views. If you have kids one of the armbands or combo tickets probably offers a better deal but we just wanted to ride the Ferris wheel. There are also touristy shops if you're looking for souvenir trinkets to take home.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melissabarronton
50,Nice day out,"It gets busy during the weekend, but it's certainly a nice day out (especially when the sun is out).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/358eddieo
50,Fun day out!,"Decided to drive up the coast and visit the famous Santa Monica pier! Only had about an hour of sun left when we arrived, but the beach was clean and relaxing, then the pier itself of lively and entertaining. Great place for families, or even just friends looking for some outdoor fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BossyBee33
30,Mediocre restaurants,"Mediocre restaurants on the pier overcharging for captive tourists. Sunset was beautiful. Most street performers were depressing pictures of life, except for the viola performer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fredk134
40,It was nice...,"I went at night and you get to see a lot of people having fun, playing music, dancing, playing at the ferris wheel, you can buy souvenirs and just in general have a good time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/764dulcef
40,Picturesque but gets busy,We managed to get here fairly early morning and it was very tranquil and pretty. Got very busy later morning and also a proliferation of people begging detracted from the feel of the place.Fabulous beach to wander along though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robem64
40,End of Route 66 - horrendous to park on the Pier,"Having driven from the Grand Canyon along Route 66 through Williams, we just had to go to the 'Route 66 last Stop shop' at the end of Santa Monica Pier.Google maps showed that I could park on the Pier or just at the side. Well that's fine on on-line but very different in reality even though it was a Tuesday. We managed to drive on to the Pier but then the car park was full so had to drive around looking for a space elsewhere.Glad we made the effort though and this was also our first sight of the Pacific Ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevanw2014
50,Great walk,Nice place to have a stroll down and have a look at buskers performing arts singing dancers plenty of activities going on down hereWith the beach for a swim,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/299clintd
40,Amazing sunset view here,Brilliant sunsets here albeit plenty of people and tourists here. Great for a stroll or jogging around the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mengyangn

30,Nothing special,"I thought it had something special because the Route 66 start or finish. Well, I was there but there is nothing special in the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joemW8634HZ
40,Nostalgia Revisited,"We had a 26 degree Celsius day, so perfect winter weather. Awesome views across the ocean in every direction. Riding the Ferris wheel gives the best views. Did the Celebrity Homes tour from the pier. Able to get down on to the beach, sand through the toes. Felt I could live in Santa Monica, which is quite a big statement from someone who lives in Melbourne, Australia (voted the world's most liveable city numerous times)!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/547vickik
10,Don't bother,"Why bother?Dirty and nothing cool about this placeThe whole place is a stinky, over busy Mecca of people trying to find a 'cool' vibe.Steer clear or visit for less than two hours, go and poke yourself in the eye - more interesting and memorable",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marklorr
50,Nice Place!,"My wife and I had a great time at the Santa Monica Pier. We chose not to use the parking at the pier and use public parking about two blocks away so we could be close to explore the town some too. We really enjoyed the classic rides available despite their high price. Smaller, kids' rides cost $5 per ride and all larger rides such as the ferris wheel and the scrambler cost $8 per ride. We enjoyed the numerous local , music artists that were along the pier. We are supper at Bubba Gump Shrimp located right on the pier and greatly enjoyed our time there. This is a must see for anyone visiting the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eabat17
40,Great day,Walked around the pier for a few minutes and loved the sunset that day. The ocean breeze is amazing as well as the views all around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveRainville99

50,Great first time experience,My wife and I visited in December 2015. This was our first time visiting the Santa Monica Pier. You never know who you might run into. We ran into actor John Schneider just walking around. He's a great guy. There are many shops and some amusement park rides as well. Definitely check this place out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soccerman4000
50,Awesome experience,"Saw seals swimming, awesome talent performing, great fun rides and amazing people watching! Muscle beach right next door? I love this place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cararox
40,Good thing to see but can be very crowded,I think everyone should visit once but it can be crowded. There are rides and an arcade that have been there for years. I would trust the merry go round and the bumper cars but I find the bigger rides a bit rickety (though they have been there for years without incident). You can walk down to the water from the pier. There are a lot of homeless in the park above the pier. Can be windy so bring a jacket for kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingworkingmom
50,A great fun place,"Santa Monica is oft forgotten highlight for a visit to LA, and the Santa Monica pier an essential factor to include. At the very least you must see the pier, even if you choose not to explore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PacoH_11
50,Wow simply wow,"For us this was amazing, after seeing it in so many movies then be able to actually hang out on the pier was amazing",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrettH1300

It was quite chilly, but fortunately, we were appropriately clothed.One of those activities that must be ticked off the bucket list, but I must say we all enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tvsinha
40,better than expected,"it was very busy - even on a chilly day. probably a fantastic place to take smaller children - to ride the carnival-type rides. the street vendors set up along the pier were very similar to each other. you'd see one selling something and walk a few yards & see another selling the same thing. there were some little souvenir places & t-shirt stalls in case you wanted to buy something like that. there were a handful of street musicians - which all were fantastic. and of course you could walk to the end to see the 'end of the line' - route 66, which was sort of neat. there were a couple of restaurants as well. worth it to see if you're in the vicinity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Howietravels
40,Good for Families,A small park next to the beach which contains a lot of activities which suitable to all family members specially the kids,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Abdulmoez-Tahmaz

50,Dream come true,Awesome park for any kind of person. Incredible security. Great variety of attractions. And an amazing view,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/diegomY8560IB
40,Not a bad way to spend a day,Came here with friends just touring around on our vacation from Minnesota. There's a couple nice restaurants on the pier and usually some street acts performing atleast when we were there. Decent activity to do for a good half day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wolves0991
30,Went there to book tour tickets.,"You can buy tickets there for stars home tours. Had time to kill before tour & checked out the pier for 2nd time, 10 years apart. Mainly for kids on pier but beaches near pier beautiful and massive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/texsandchina
40,Nice activity for a warm day but pricey,"The pier and the surrounding beaches are definitely worth a trip. The view from the Ferris wheel is stunningly beautiful. The rest of the rides are ok, but expensive",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bjoernc2014
30,Kind of a zoo,"Lots of people, lots of tourist trap shops, get up early in the morning to stroll around in comfort then be done with it. History of the pier is interesting; this can be read in just about any tourist brochure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hola4876
40,"Busy, Busy Pier","When we were there, it was packed with people, but lots of rides, vendors & pier performers! The beach area was very, very large, but it was a chilly day, so not many people on it! A fun family place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11phyllish
50,Wonderful & Strange,We loved our experience on the pier with its street performers and vendors. On our budget the food and souvenirs were a bit pricey for us so we headed back to the Venice boardwalk for $2 tacos but the pier is a must see and an interesting walk. We were lucky enough to see a seal and actor Adrian Martinez who was super friendly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bacongirl1
40,Santa Monica Pier,"Good activity for a stroll. Hawkers and art were pretty average. Nice casual outdoor activity. We didn't go into the theme park, didn't look like it was all that exciting",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/54sloping
50,My favourite place,"A great mix of quirky and historic. Great food too, especially the fresh fruit stalls. Iconic too as it appears in so many films/tv shows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bunty62
40,Fun Time on Santa Monica Pier!,"We arrived at the Santa Monica Pier just in time to watch a gorgeous west coast sunset. There is a lot of parking available for a $6:00 fee. It is a beautiful area of Southern California with a nice beach, fishing, restaurants, souvenir stores, entertainment and numerous photo opportunities! There is a fun amusement park (Pacific Park) right on the pier. The unlimited ticket price was quite reasonable for the 15 to 20 rides on-site. When Santa Monica Pier is lit up at night the fun experience is unforgettable!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MKTBE
40,Quick visit to the pier in Santa Monica,"Took me back to the fairs and carnivals of yesteryear. 14 year old had fun on the rides, although there are not that many. We ate at Bubba Gump's. OK food and a bit spendy, especially on the drinks. Would have preferred to come here during the daytime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryandaws0n
50,Love it,A must to visit if you visit LA. Very nice place and very nice view. I really enjoyed the walk there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sitthinees
40,The best people watching,"An icon of so many movies and the terminus of the famous Route 66. Packed on a sunny winters day. Plenty to do on the pier with numerous buskers and lots of cafes, coffee, ice creams and rides. A must do as part of a visit to the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KookaburraMike
40,"Crowded and touristy, but great during sunset",The sunset is the best time to visit as you get a beautiful sunset and watch the pier lights turn on. It's a neat experience to see this pier transform in just a couple hours. Be prepared for crowds!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/indyemmett
50,Fun way to people watch!!,"Had such a great time at the pier. The views are incredible, a lot of restaurants to choose from, fun artists to watch or listen to and a nice walk on the beach. It's a great day! Parking is easy and affordable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A7287WEmaryb
40,Great for Sunset,As expected it is very touristy but a good spot to see the sunset. I rode the Ferris wheel (costs $8). Great view but pretty expensive so a one time only thing for me. After sunset there are many great restaurants to walk to in the area. (Not on the pier itself).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NC_mQk
40,Very touristy but a must when you're visiting,"The end to route 66 is a must. The pier is crowded with people and vendors but very laid back. Parking was easy and if you like the beach, it's literally right there beside the parking lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/photodoug
40,Fun day for the faniky,"We really enjoyed our day here. Plenty to do and see, including paradise pier amusement park, which the kids loved. Food prices are very high and eating options limited. Lovely 30 minute walk from here to Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LizF12345
50,Perfect for a Sunset View,"Charming and lovely place to spent an afternoon. We arrived for lunch - at Bubba Gump`s. And spent entire afternoon, until sunset.Lot of shopping and diffferent attractions for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/370katiah
50,Excellent place for Sunset viewing,"This is a fun place to go to enjoy the sites, ocean views, people, and sunset. Definitely worth a visit when in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathleenBW
40,Great Views,Nice restaurants on the pier. Did not take part in the amusements but excellent views of the beach north and sotuh.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blaino316
30,a lot of people,"during the week end a lot of people come here! There is a small luna park, and lot of stores, just for a fast meal or really restaurant. From here you can take a look on Santa Monica Beach and Ocean front or start a promenade to Venice beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MassimoPieraccini
50,Great for young families.,"My family and I went for a walk down to the pier and spent sometime on the beach. I was here 10 years ago and I can honestly say, nothing has changed. That's not the least, to say in anyways that it is a bad thing, that nothing has change. If they had renovated this place I believe that there would be a lot more people here, the prices for food and touristy items will sky rocket!My children are aged 5 & 6 years old and they loved every interesting detail about this place. Next time we come back to America we will definitely hire some bikes and ride along the main road.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melesinaf
40,Worth a visit,"Walking the pier is something worth doing, especially for people watching. The rides are more for kids and teens. There is a good restaurant at the end of the pier, with good drinks. Unfortunately, the famous carousel was c!osed. There are stands of stuff for sale, mostly junk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NittanyLioness73
50,Fun way to spend an afternoon in Cali,We had a fun time walking along the boardwalk enjoying the beautiful ocean and fun people watching.There are a few spots to grab and snack while you enjoy your day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flying4
40,Crazy place,Lots of activity and great people watching in this central Santa Monica location. Many food choices. Great Beach and boardwalk experience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanandCaptainRob
30,Too touristy,"Since the age of myself and wife is beyond 50, this attraction was not so appealing. A little aged, pricey, and overall not so interesting for us. Maybe if we had been a young family....... On the positive side, it must offer wonderful sunsets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ButaTokyo
10,Eh...,"An idyllic setting that should be a great trip for the family has been corrupted by the bums, vagrants and potheads that now litter the main entry to the pier. It is dirty, smells of urine, unwashed bodies and marijuana. I wouldn't recommend anyone bring their kids here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mtjllc
30,pretty but pricy,we went to the beach and walked the pier. it gets crowed during the main portion of the day. the restaurants were a little pricy for what you got. Its one of those places that it was nice to see once but I probably wont go back for a while.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacobb784
40,Best for people watching,"The pier in itself isnt so great. Its a strip of junky tourist stuff for sale, and typical pier food (churros). There is an old arcade which is not well maintained and a few rides that I have never been on. However, I love coming here for the great people watching and location. Its obviously right by the beach, and its a public beach so you can walk down and hang out there. The people watching is fantastic-if you are lucky you will see ""Dancing Dave"" a shirtless middle aged man dance around. I love watching him!! Its close to the promenade and Santa Monica place and definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveltheplanet05
50,Best one,This place is end of Route 66. There is many thing to do. I had to walking around city center and pier. I love to spend more time there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Morijyo
50,Holiday 2017,We had a great day in the sun.This place is fun. Lots of little stalls and great rides for all ages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edsring
50,Iconic step back in time,"How wonderful to visit this amazing pier that provides families of today with an opportunity to experience the same fun originally offered to others many decades ago! As you stroll along the pier, you will enjoy much more than a beach and ocean view - there are souvenir shops, historical displays, restaurants and a fully functioning amusement park and games arcade. My tween particularly enjoyed the roller coaster and Ferris wheel - not to be missed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Liisa0
40,Cool,"Had to be done, an upmarket Weston supermare affair but a nice relaxed promenade with plenty to do and see. #tourist attraction. Plus looks spectacular at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/louisam805
20,A bit tatty,"Was really looking forward to visiting the pier, however it is a tatty amusement pier with very expensive underwhelming attractions. $8 for one ride on the 1 minute rollercoaster!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T9512PUtimb
50,Fun and beautiful place,Our great little visit to the Pier was fun and full of good ambience. The view to the ocean is fantastic with many interesting performers and fishing local people all mixed among the exciting little theme park. Great place to go with kids and maybe have a funnel cake :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnietKoo
50,Good atmospherr,"Even in the winter it's a great place to walk, glance up the coast towards Malibu and take in the gift shops and atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahbU1880ES
40,Busy,This place has a lot going on and is quite busy. We didn't stay long and decided to walk to Venice. I recommend going at slower times.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheBeachUnicorn
50,A must see when in the LA area!,"Visited Santa Monica Pier and Santa Monica near the beach. Pier is pretty cool. We were there at sunset, which was really breathtaking. Seeing the pier and iconic Santa Monica Pier sign light up was amazing. Parked at the mall that is attached to the pedestrian promenade. 3rd Street Promenade is worth spending some time walking through. Wish we had more time to explore but maybe on our next trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ironleague
40,Laid back,"The pier had a real laid back feel about it! Maybe it was the time of year, being quieter at this time of year. What ever the reason, it made for an enjoyable visit. Worth a visit just to have a hunt for a souvenir, listen to the music, grab a bite to eat or just for a wander around!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kohinoor12
40,If in the area a nice place to hangout.,The pier is your typical ocean boardwalk venue with food from grab and go to sit down dining. Vendors and performers are throughout and there are some rides for the kids and the kids at heart.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewsK2206EY
20,Used to be a pleasant pier.,"Over the past several years the Pier changed from a quiet and romantic place to visit to an amusement park like attraction with crowds so dense on the weekends that if you let go of your kids hand, you may loose him. It's still somewhat nice to visit during the weekdays though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAVict0ria
40,"Great views, quite crowded",My friend took me here just so I could say I've been. Wasn't exactly disappointed either. Loved seeing the views of the west coast and the Pacific Ocean for the first time. Had a delicious funnel cake. Though it was crowded I kind of expected that. The arcade though is a little outdated. Really needs an update.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kcam1115
30,Crowdy,Been there January 1 st. Too many people. Big lines. No free parking space. Just a few attractions for children. No point to go there at all. Walk on the beach is much better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnaP3413
40,Good View,It was good to visit this place - good view. Go here around the evening time to see the sunset and then have dinner - there are good dinner places around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gauravkapoor08
40,Beautiful Day,What a great way to start off the new year.The views were great of the mountains and Malibu. Great for kids and adults wanting to be a kid.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephensT9159RZ
30,Rides are a bit tired.,"Kids were thrilled. Us? Not so much. Probably would be more fun in the warmer weather but alas, that would be our luck. Kids had fun though and that's why we went. There are fewer than 10 rides for bigger kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rathsog
40,Must do,"This is a definite must do, but be prepared for lots of homeless people everywhere! At no point did I feel unsafe, but they are definitely everywhere. The place looks a little older and you might have to get over the fact it looks kind of rundown but once you get over that it's super cute, great views, lots of different artists and other people making things out on the pier, not to mention all the rides the kids can go on. You can walk a short distance about 15 minutes to the 3rd Street shopping Promenades where there is endless shopping!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliciaK138
50,Great views and fun shops!,Had a great time walking the pier shopping in the shops. Food from the food vendors was excellent. Overall we had a very enjoyable experience and made some great memories!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kree8vkin
50,"I love that it's rickety, smells bad and that there's nothing better to do on it, than simply being there.","Yeah there's a Carousel, a tacky, overpriced fun fair, an old school arcade, numerous fast food and chain annexes, but really, just walking out on the wooden planks. People watching and if you get there, checking out the catch from local fishermen & women. It's the only place you might feel you're in a much smaller city for the time you're on the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/unprocessed_cook
40,"It is a pier, in California, with Fair Rides and games attached.","It was a nice warm day the day we were there (in the high 70s). Nice walk on the pier and a nice walk in the sand and got our feet wet in the ocean. We parked at the pier.The rides and games looked OK, nothing that grabbed our attention.We live on Route 66, so to see the end of it was a point of interest.Lots of folks selling something, rocks shells, pictures, music, ice cream, funnel cakes and etc.Lot of people watchingIt was a good stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/318bks
50,Fun on the beach,"Amazing beach, weather was awesome in august. Food on the pier is great. Couple of good Italian restaurants😊",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sharad83
30,Beautiful views average attraction,The idea of it being this amazing place may have made me a bit disappointed when it didnt live up to expectation. It was good and the views were lovely and i am so glad i went because it is a great place but it seems like a bit of a forgotten place in need of an update.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/553callumc
50,California Vacation,"We enjoyed walking on the pier. There is no entrance fee and there are various activities going on such as painting your name in fun ways on paper and rice. There are rides, music, and food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wendy083
40,You can't come to Santa Monica and not visit the pier,After all it's what makes the town right?Pier goes out into the ocean with a lot of buskers which was good entertainment. Lots of souvenirs and a few really good places to eat. Must go.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/766christinal
20,Tacky tourist spot,Avoid. Full of tacky tourist stuff! The only good thing was the view of the ocean. The beach had more bins than people. The pier is resting on its Glory Days past. Not worth the 30 minute uber ride.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Clancy007
40,Fun visit,We had fun walking around the pier. The shops and vendors were interesting. Everything is a bit overpriced. The views are gorgeous. The amusement park seems fun and not too expensive. We rode only the ferris wheel which was nice. The views were cool from it as well. It was $8 to ride it. The beach was beautiful too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emily02020
40,Nice day in the sun,The pleasure pier is nice. The rides are mostly for little kids but for adults there are a few things. I had fun reading the signs about the history of Santa Monica and the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/760juliana2019
30,It would be fun for a child,I'm not a child and there is nothing of interest there for an adult unless you have some kids to take along or interested in what looked like average food options. Time wasted,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LifeAsABackpacker
40,Worth a visit when in LA. Expect a crowd,"I've been to LA several times and I always make a stop at Santa Monica Pier. Parking close to the pier can be costly. There are 2hr free parking spaces on the road just 10mins walk away. Expect the pier to be crowded at all times of the day, especially sunset. Fun walk along the pier if you don't mind the crowd. Arcade games at the end of the pier are pricey. Several restaurants but nothing fancy. Lots of touristy shops too. Stay for sunset. It's beautiful sight.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MTL66
50,Iconic!,A must do if ever in Cali! Loved seeing this iconic place! A little crowed when we were there but overall fun time. Ate dinner at Bubba Gumps & was great!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DGay90
40,Make a day of it,"My last visit to this pier was 10 years ago. I didn't recall seeing the homelessness then. It is prominent now around the walkway to the pier. The smell of urine/feces was intense. It distracted me from thinking about the Three's Company theme song, the one with Jack Tripper. I took the 704 transit bus from Santa Monica and La Brea Ave. It was a 30 min trip. It dropped me off at the beach. There are many Amusement rides, and many places to eat, seated and at food kiosks. Many music buskers can be appreciated, too. There are several places to take some great photos. On the beach, there is a (or was while I was there) a series of crosses marking lost soldiers. To get back to Hollywood I took the Expo Rail line. Its a direct walk, 4 blocks up from the pier. I got off at 7th/Metro and switched to the Red line and got off and Hollywood and Highland.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/916elled
50,Excellent place to visit in LA,"We loved this location. The Warf is beautiful, historic and has so much to do (even if you just hang out). There are restaurants, rides and bars and it is especially lovely at sundown.The beach activities are also outstanding, with walking and running paths for all to use, and beach gym activities to participate in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bicks_medellin
40,Everything for everyone,"Just like the ""Hollywood"" sign, the Santa Monica Pier appears in so many Hollywood movies and it is considered an iconic historic landmark attraction that is known around the world. Travelers should read about the history of the pier before visiting it because to get a little sensed of importance and history of the peer. Santa Monica Looff Hippodrome building ""which houses the carousel is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The pier offers everything for everyone, good food and good music, amusement park, sunset on the beach and even the sign that shows the end of ""Route 66"". If you do not like crowded places with lots of noise, you can sit and have good dinner and take a picture or two of yourself and the iconic gate to the pier. It is easy access from downtown Los Angeles by Metro Rail (less than an hour from the start). Then enjoy the great view of sunset on the pier or on the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrawetJ
40,Fun place to hang out and take pictures,"This is a great place for pictures with the beach and mountains as backdrops. Live music, rides, food and easy parking make it a good place to visit with the family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/260HeidiC
50,Family Fun!,"We went before noon in the week after Christmas. We got a great parking spot ($6) and enjoyed the young families at the Pier. We rode the cute roller coaster and played games from our childhood in the Arcade. This is a family-friendly, affordable, clean place to hang out for a few hours. Our family loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mommylowe
50,Great place to visit,"The Santa Monica pier is a must see if in the area. Plenty of things to do, just go for a walk out there and check out the people",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dgo_Guy
50,Great family fun,Enjoyed the timeless attraction with the family. Kids and I rode the sea drain and roller coaster. Had a burger at pier burger. The kids rated it highly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/300stevem
40,Really nice place for a stroll,"I love Santa Monica Pier. It's a really nice place to stroll, take in the sea air, eat bad-for-you (but tasty) food and just generally chill out. There's a section of it which has all the rides on but that bit isn't for me (I'm too scared!) so I stick to the main boardwalk which I love.I walk to the Pier from Venice Beach so I can't comment on the parking etc. but there does seem to be loads available although it looks like it's a squash on the pier itself.The walk from the Pier up to Santa Monica, and particularly Third Promenade, is quite a nice walk and not too far at all. There are plenty of restaurants on the way too :)Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cheesecake0509
40,Destination for a beach stroll,"Not nearly as tacky as I expected. The amusement park was low key. It was busy, but still nice to walk the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnsE9432KT
50,Santa Monica beach,Just a superb place for beach activities. The place lives up to its hype and can provide a great day for the outdoor lovers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NinjaHyderabad

40,Quintessential California beach experience,"It was raining and cold today, so it wasn't very crowded, which was nice. There is a beautiful large beach area. The pier had games, food and rides. It's very well kept and clean. Nice experience. We just don't love the carnival type activities. But there really is something for everyone here. I would love to come again when the weather is nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/740taras
50,Get on the ferris wheel at sunset,We went on the ferris wheel at sunset and it was so beautiful best view in Santa monica there are plenty of food places on the pier including Bubba Gumps,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petalac
40,Great but an expensive tourist trap.,It's a fantastic place to visit. At the end of the pier you can spot dolphins and sea lions popping up out of the water.There is plenty of entertainment from the very artistic and talented to the crazy.I recommend a visit to here. But it's expensive and I would avoid buying anything on the pier.The aquarium is great and at only $5 for an adult and free for children under 12 it's well worth it. It's not very big and it's more about education but as the money goes to the research and upkeep it's worth every penny.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Loulou01772
40,A few hours of fun during a driving tour,"With your kids, 8 and 6, they enjoyed driving the Pacific Coast Highway to Santa Monica and going to the ""carnival."" Rode the rides with unlimited access because it was more cost efficient with prices at $5 and $8 per ride. Bracelets were $18 for 7 and under and $29 for others. Kids loved it and were happy with something special to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/723kima
50,Plenty to do,"There is an array of things to do at the Pier for kids, families, and adults. It's a must for all ages, food, games, and people to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elij51189
40,Great View!,"We visited the pier on our first trip to California this November. It seemed like a great place for us to finally see the Pacific ocean, and that there would be fun stuff there to do. The ocean and the scenery are beautiful! The mountains and the beach are very picturesque, as is the pier. However, we did not participate in any of the attractions as the rides were ridiculously over-priced and the food options, not great. I think this place is highly overrated in that aspect, but if you're just visiting to dip your toes in the Pacific, hang out on the beach, or for the view, then this is an awesome place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jsgirl44
50,A must visit in your LA trip,"We spent about an hour here and had lunch on the pier. We had read so much about it and were glad to visit it. It's an iconic part of America. Take the time, walk to the end of it and soak in the views and people watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bwco
50,As advertised,"Santa Monica pier is tacky, glitzy, perfect! We rented bikes and ride from Marina Del Rey to the pier. It was a great way to explore. Rode the Ferris wheel, enjoyed the street performers, stopped for a beer It was simply a perfect, just what I expected Southern California afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jayneb428
50,Great place to spend your evening,Has lot of things to venture into or just spend time sitting. Lots to around as well or stroll on beach or take a dip or sip on. Great place for kids and teens. Rides and games on the pier. Parking can be a hassle and challenging at times. Next time around will try visiting during daylight.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jay_as_tripvisor
40,Nice and relaxing,Nice and relaxing as we visited in the off season however it was still reasonably busy. Easy walk along the pier and nice ocean views. Rides etc for the younger kids to enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveT8309
40,Nice in the evening,"Nice walk in the evening, The arcade looked fun for kids. Places to eat and shop for souvenirs. A long walk up and down the ramp to the pier for anyone with mobility problems (like a bad knee). Saw a few people struggling to push people in Wheelchairs up that steep hill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trailblazer06
40,Busy and touristy but worth a visit,Great to visit - quite touristy but nice atmosphere and views. A nice place to stroll along and nearby paths and parkland great for people watching.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/50TrishS

30,Nice walk!!,"A short fun walk along the pier,Fun park is good for young kids, roller coaster is not scary!!Great people viewing.Usual chain food outlets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nigletti
30,Crowded and Kitchy,The Pier was a good place to people watch and listen to the musicians playing covers. It was reminiscent of a typical East Coast summer resort boardwalk. I wouldn't wheat here or buy anything here but it was worth the $6.00 parking fee.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jg1502
30,Not what I expected,Beautiful ocean views but terrible scenery in the park leading to the pier. Lots of homeless people and garbage lying around. Disappointed that this area is not held to a higher standard.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luvtotravel0330

40,"Beautiful place, very crowded","It's a nice place to see if you're in the neighborhood anyway.

40,Must see attraction,An amusement park at the end of a pier and if you're lucky you can see some seals swimming around whilst people are trying to fish. Parking can be a real problem but luckily we caught an uber there so didn't have to worry about that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CTR15

30,We have visited a couple of times. It's just 'okay',"We have visited a couple of times, once just adults and another time with kids.It's just ok. Nothing to write home about. The view is lovely though. On a sunny day it's worth going there to check out the beach from the pier.Hard to get a park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmandaF1868
50,Great Attraction,"This is a lovely area. There's dining, carnival type tides, amazing ocean views. If you're in the area, don't miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L120KHkarenr
50,Good old-fashioned fun,"We read a bunch of other reviews before traveling to LA and were a little skeptical about the Pier. We ended up spending half a day there. It was cool and overcast that day and not too many people. Only two rides where open, including the Great Wheel, which we went on. We loved it! It is not new and not high-tech, but it's got the carnival fun atmosphere and makes you feel like a kid again. We loved the view of the ocean from the wheel. Our son played at the arcades, we took some silly pictures in the photo booth and got some snacks. We loved watching the seagulls dive down for food... all in all, it was unexpectedly one of the best experiences we had during our trip to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rogerhouse

30,Must do but parking is terrible.,"Nice selection of restuarants and the amusement park is good for young kids and adults who don't like the gut wrenching ones in the theme parks.

40,Fun for the day,My family and come to this pier when we have friends visiting. The area is great to grab lunch on the 3rd street promenade and then walk over to the pier to let the kids go on some rides. People not from the area really enjoy it. It can get really crowded so beware. Also if you go online you can purchase wristband in advance at a discounted price sometimes.It you get tired of the crowded pier you can walk to the mall to shop or have a drink. The beach is also just down the steps so you can truly make a whole day of it there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luvtotravel0007
40,Nice for a visit.,"We walked up and back on the pier. There were some interesting restaurants and shops. We did not go on any of the rides, but the pier itself was well kept up and nice.

40,Fun day trip,"Great place to enjoy the sunshine of southern California. Great food (garlic fries are the best thing ever).

50,So much fun,This has to be one of my favorite days of my trip. Visiting the Santa Monica Pier was such a great time with my husband the roller coaster is a blast and the ferris wheel is gorgeous views I must do when visiting the pier. We tried a bunch of little snacky foods and then finished it all off with a homemade milkshake. Walk down to the beach Wade In The Water and the sand. Great day all around,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barendinas
30,Expected It To Be More,"Having heard the hype about the pier, I had expected it to be grander.

40,Fun,Couldn't come to santa monica and not check out the pier. It was a lot of fun. You can buy an arm band for rides or pay per ride. We opted for per ride as we only wanted to ride 2. And wasn't going to ride multiple times. The coaster and ferris wheel are $8 per ride. It was right before they closed and the coaster was dead so they let us ride it twice which was nice. Enjoyable and nice evening.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adub359

40,Well worth the ride,We decided to hire out a couple of bikes and use peddle power to get from Muscle beach through Venice beach and to Santa Monica Pier. It seemed the most popular way to do so. Santa Monica pier at sunset is amazing to see. The great party feel about the place is really amazing. Some great eateries along the pier and plenty of nic-nac shops there too. It can get user busy but I think it all adds to the vibe. Street entertainment here is brilliant too. A must see on your trip here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/willie_corcoran6

30,It's beautiful but don't go on the rides.,If you go to LA make sure to come here at night. They have all the rides lit up at night and sometimes they have fireworks. But the rides cost like 20$ per ride for one person and they're not good rides so I wouldn't suggest going on the rides. I would say come here but don't go on the rides.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Oshea_1013

50,The end Route 66.,"What a surprise after our family of ten aussies spent the last three weeks touring around California,Nevada and Arizona to have our last day in LA visiting the Santa Monica Pier. We had no idea that this is the the end of the famous Route 66 which we had been travelling on for weeks,but what a way to finish our trip.Drive right down onto the pier,parking for a small fee,then wander along the picturesque board walk out to the end and check out the golden beaches and clear blue ocean.Lots of tourist shops and eateries to check out,we had lunch at Bubba Gump's seafood restaurant then headed off to LAX for our long flight home.Perfect finish to a lovely holiday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidR841

The street performers were interesting, they ranged from zany weak talent to amazing talent. Rides, games and vendors. Granted it is a tourist trap so don't expect any deals on food or drink.But don't forget to take in the things happening on the adjacent beach area. There is a lot of things happening close to the beach. It's busy and there's plenty of fun people things to watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MicroCleanse

Bring a jacket, as it can be breezy and quite cool in the evening. Parking wasn't bad - inexpensive, well-organized and close to the attractions.

50,A must visit if you're from out of town. Fun for the entire family!,"I grew up in LA and so I remember what the pier looked like before the amusement park. So visiting it the other day with my daughters, was very nice, unique, nostalgic and overall amazing. They loved getting on the ferris wheel, roller coaster and other rides.The old school arcade is still very nostalgic of what arcades used to be, before all the fancy new games and/or home game consoles.You can walk up and down the pier, there is also a merry-go-round. Overall, it's a great attraction, especially if you're from out of town!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrBalan11

50,My visit to Santa Monica pier,Great tourist attraction you actually can park on pier. I tried the big wheel which kind of scary if you don't like heights. This pier was used in filing of The Lost Boys and the original Zoltar used in the film Big is there also. There's quite performers on the pier I'll leave for you to decide.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/silatglen
40,A nice activity for a warm day,We visited Santa Monica as a day trip while visiting LA. It's a lovely beach-side location with lots of shops and attractions.We think it's HEAPS better than Venice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielspada

50,Iconic attraction,"This was the one place while in LA that I wanted to go to. There were several shops and restaurants on the pier, and of course the amusement rides. Mainly, we were just there for the experience of being there. We ate at Bubba Gump's on the pier. Even at night, there was a decent view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShadySpot

50,Great Old Fashioned Fun,"We had a great time going on the rides and seeing the aquarium at the Santa Monica Pier! It's not as big or as advanced as the theme parks but the rides and atmosphere were a lot of fun! The views of the ocean, beach and mountains were also breathtaking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adamhiker
50,Great visit,"Went to see Santa Monica Pier the other day and the weather was great. Amazing views of the beach area, food of course gets up there, but it's for tourists, so eat cheaply before going. And there is a Bubba Gump Shrimp store the moment you walk on the Pier to your right.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickb9902
40,STILL GOOD FOR A STROLL INTO YESTERYEAR,"Never tire of a walk down memory lane; how many piers like this are even left? And remember how it was featured in the opening of the the 1973 movie, ""The Sting.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuperChief49

30,Nothing special,"View is beautiful, panorama wheel is boring and expensive (16$) Amusement park is interesting for young children <12. Many spots where you can spend money and regret :)))) Nice to see, but my suggestion is not to spend to much time there, LA and Santa Monica have more interesting spots than this",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H5650ODninas
40,It's time for good vibes!,"It may be crowded on the weekends in summer, it may take up to two hours from LA downtown (driving time w/o traffic is 30-45 minutes) to get to Santa Monica Pier, however this place has a special and unforgettable atmosphere that is really worth a visit. We rent a bike and we had a ride from the Northern end of the bike path in Santa Monica till Marina del Rey and we felt free, like enthusiastic children on their school holidays. The pier offer ranges from some fast food and restaurants, to The Pacific Park (an amusement park) and, to all Pokemon Go lovers, be aware this place is a real hub.If you are visiting Santa Monica, do not forget to take some pictures to and from the Pier, as this attraction is ideal for a modern postcard, to be shared on the social networks to illustrate America's best spirit. Leave the stress behind, it's time to live and spread good vibes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sdp_traveller_360
40,Classic sea location,"We enjoyed walking the pier and visiting the shops and restaurants. A bit too much cigarette smoke, but we headed to the beach to avoid the worst of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TracyB_Htown
40,"Beautiful beach, amazing ocean, and fun times on the Santa Monica Pier!","During our recent trip to southern California, we spent part time at the Santa Monica Pier. After lunch at Mariasol, we walked along the pier and the beach while enjoying the sights and sounds of the ocean. Beautiful! FYI, parking may be a challenge. We parked in a parking garage a couple of blocks away and walked to the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maui2014NMR
50,A Must See!!,"We went to the pier on Thanksgiving day!! It was spectacular . There were street performers. We even saw a sea lion inthe water. Best thing ever, we saw the actor Bryshere Gray from the show Empire just casually strolling the pier with a cute little female. Stopped and took a pic with him. He was really nice and even cuter in person.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myprecious11
40,A walk on the pier,Came here with family and had a blast. Started our walk and stopped to listen to and watch the various pier performances. After lunch we rode some of the rides.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Angeljer

50,Fun,"This place you see on TV all the time, next too Venice beach this location is very popular..The beach is huge and goes for miles....on the Pier the rides are great for kids, carnival atmosphere. Walking distance to the Santa Monica shops.....lots of people lots of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luvtodive
40,"A flash back in time, best for kids under 11 or so","The pier had a good vibe, but seems to be geared towards families with younger children. The food choices, rides, attractions, etc are more targeted for kids around 10 imho.We went twice (day and night). I certainly felt safer during the day so I would avoid taking children late due to the homeless population.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ProfessorX69
30,Go early,"We went in the morning (no issues parking in the lot to the north of the pier) and enjoyed the long stroll down to the end of the pier. The place wasn't too crowded, shops were open, and there were a couple of street performers entertaining the visitors. We went up to the Promenade for a couple of hours and came back to the pier for lunch. The place was wall to wall people. In amongst the street entertainers were several religious screamers with loud PA systems (one within about 5 feet of the entrance of Bubba Gumps). This took all of the charm out of visiting. There was no way to get away from it - so we left.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/callesol105
50,To have fun.!!,"My family and I had an amazing time at the Santa Monica Pier, they have a logo of attractions for the kids, you can enjoy shops and fresh sea food restaurants around pier.

50,Bucket list,"I flew to LA just to visit the wizarding world of Harry Potter and to cross off one item from life long bucket list, riding a Ferris wheel on an ocean pier! It was everything I expected it to be and more!!! The whole place has a nostalgic feel and was a lot of fun. It's easily accessible and very close to Venice beach as well! Highly recommend this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cosmoninja
50,Top attraction in LA,Went for a walk in late afternoon - perfect timing. Watched the sunset and spotted a Harbour Seal in the water. So much fun. There are a lot of shops and restaurants as well. Don't miss the sign that marks the end of the Route 66.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/820lenkam
50,Beautiful!,"As a teenager the pier is exactly what I imagined California to be. Our trip consisted of 2 adults, 1 teen, and 2 children under 7. We all had a blast!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicasJ6730TU
30,Cali 2016,"Going to the Pier was a side trip during our stay in Pasadena. The pier was interesting, the views were pretty, but I was disappointed that there was nothing about it that made it special or separated it from any other pier along the coast. Access to the beach was very nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimberlyb659
50,One of the good beaches,"Nice Beach and a beach town. Good Pier to view sunset. Plenty of activities, on the Pier.Beach is clean, plenty of restrooms, shower, changing rooms.Can go to deep in the ocean, it's shallow, till a stretch. Not to big waves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/700muneera
40,"Relaxing, Refreshing, & Entertaining","We were wrapping up the last day of our vacation. We drove from Universal City to the pier. Grabbed a parking place in the lot to the right (N) of the pier, and walked around to take in the beautiful sights, assorted smells, and interesting entertainment here at the pier.We didn't limit ourselves to just the pier, and walked back up to the main drag and headed north. Getting hungry we searched TA to see where & what we'd like to eat and found the #1 eatery in the area, so we continue to navigate on foot and timed our arrival right when they opened. The Hillstone was amazing, check the review.After our meal we grabbed a Starbucks and headed back to the parking lot by was of the 3rd street promenade, another great Santa Monica cultural and shopping experience.This is a great place and loved every minute of it. There is a large homeless population here, and never once felt unsafe or pressured in any way...Peace, Matt😎",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MattR154
30,"Fun, but so very touristy","Santa Monica Pier reminds me of New Jersey, but with a little less character. The rides are very expensive, the restaurants are all just ok. And very crowded. The view is very pretty of course. Honestly it's a big check mark and the next time I'd skip it (I'd skip it altogether and do something else if I had it to do over).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelgames
40,Nice Tourist attraction for a walk,"It is a nice and well maintained place. I would recommend to go there and take some pictures. Like any other tourist attraction, expect many many people there. Don't go if you don't tolerate crowds. Beautiful to see the sunset. I prefer Manhattan Beach, though!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarlosMauricioM
40,End of Route 66 sign is here,"Yep, it is in this pier where this famous sign is. Apart from that, just another pier. Quite nice actually. And of course the rest of the beautiful beaches around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kinop2015
10,Very touristy,Your typical tourist trap. A lot of people selling random souvenirs and overpriced food. I would not recommend this even the views from the pier were nothing special that couldn't be seen from the beach. Much preferred the Venice beach or Hermossa beach area. Maybe with children's this would be better as the rides and buskers did not appeal to a couple in their 30's.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/franka04
50,Iron man re-enactment,"Felt the need to go on the coaster since I loved the scenes from the movie iron man when he flies by. So much fun playing the games and reenacting the 1,000 's of movies shot there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spiderwoman808
50,Great view,The perfect plan is to rent some bikes and see the sunset across Santa Monica and Venice beaches. The pier is very cool but it gets crowded. It has free bathroom and showers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ViviX26
30,Worth a few minutes of your time,Don't miss the end of Route 66 sign for a good photo opportunityThe view of the sea and beach from the end is very nice - you can also watch the guys fishing (and not catching anything!!!),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mike48
50,Great day out,"Visited here with a group of friends and it didnt disappoint. Walking up the pier you get great views of the city behind you and beautiful ocean views. We decided to have lunch at Bubba Gump, food was delicious, had a lovely stroll in the beach then went off for a shopping trip. This is a great spot for families too. In the night it too looks glorious with all the lights switched on on the pier and the other attractions there too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NasimaA22
40,Great views,Close to Venice Beach this pier is family oriented with get food. Enjoyed visiting but it would have been better at night. That is when more people are out and about,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vaustin30
50,Route 66 ends here,"We enjoy the pier. It was clean and a family friendly atmosphere. Many of the shops were still closed, as we were there in the morning. Parking was only 1.00 and hour. We will return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jtsq2
50,Great Time With My 6 Year Old Granddaugther,"Perfect place to take your grandkids. Plenty of rides of rides for the ""little"" ones and the a few good rides for the bigger ones. We enjoyed the ferris wheel, bumper boats and several other rides she could do herself. The place is clean and well maintained. Parking is easy, right on the Pier. We will be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geckobvi
50,First Time to the Pier,"My wife and I took a Lyft here after visiting the Chinese Theater. The Pier is pretty cool, lots of vendors and places to eat, there is a Bubba Gump shrimp that we wanted to go to but we had already eaten lunch. The Pier offers some great photographic views of the norther LA shore to include the Malibu coast, and the southern Venice beach. Afterwards we walked south on the bike path to Venice beach which was about 20 min walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WillyG901
50,Great Place - Awesome Sunset!,The pier itself marks the end of the Historic Route 66 and as such there are a tonne of places selling related items. There are plenty of places to get food and there is lots of parking. Watching the sun set over the Pacific from the pier was amazing and the photographer in me decided the pier was a fantastic backdrop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joshr309
30,Santa Monica pier,It was abit of disappointment that they close so early!! I arrived at approx 8pm and everything was already shut!It was quiet beautiful from what I could see - but can't really comment as it was closed!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/759taniar
50,Wonderful,"Best hotel in Los Angeles.Michele at the front desk made our stay better than what we anticipated.Will never stay elsewhere.Staff amazing, cleanly and beautiful rooms.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maps519353
30,Go on sunset,"Our first visit was on a Monday evening for a walk around. We arrived at 430pm, so just perfect for sunset photos and evening photos of the LA beach line. The timber decking is a bit uneven so beware for kids and elderly. Fairly busy with people when we were there but I can imagine it to be more crowded on weekends/holidays. On the pier, we saw a few classy looking restaurants, buskers, arts and souvenir vendors. The further out onto the pier you go, the cheaper price for the same souvenir. There is plenty of fast food restaurants around the amusement ride area. There was plenty of families eating there, we did not. We spent a little time in the amusement area. Not cheap at $8 or $5 a ride but at $30 unlimited rides, you can make it worthwhile. Rides are good old school rides where you get to move somewhere, get thrown around a bit. Not just sit in a room with 3D glasses and go nowhere like many of the rides at DL or US. Rides are pretty tame, probably due to restrictions as set on a pier. The pier is well worth a look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamieJustine
30,worth stopping by,"really love the views and atmosphere. mostly a tourist spot with a few locals working out. somewhat commercial, but I really loved the guy singing karaoke there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/140kennethy
40,A place we had to see,Of course we had to go to Santa Monica and Pier and ride the rides and take some photos. But it didn't really push any buttons for us that make us want to go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brunettefairytravel
50,Great walk,We stayed in a hotel just back from the beach. We walked the beach and board walk down to Venice beach. Easy walk and great scenery. We caught the bus back. Excellent place to stay,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leesh0rt
50,Dinner on the Pier,"Our family took some Italian visitors for a walk on the pier with a lovely meal at Bubba Gumps right on the pier on probably the only rainy day of the year. It was still beautiful and bustling with life and color. We felt very safe. Yes, there are homeless people walking around and asking for money. But, safe and well worth dodging raindrops. The pier is very impressive and photo worthy for our Italian guests.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/connieh194
40,Bucket list item 😟,Nothing special but one of those bucket list places. The views are great so all in all a good place to spend an hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SDogg1963
50,Walked from Venice beech to the pier,"Parking was expensive at the pier and the main Venice beech, so parked half way and walked, really nice walk. Lovely beech, good walk ways and lots of parks on the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahhJ8096TW
30,Fell because boards not maintainef,The pier is going down hill fast. There were a lot of people as it was Veterans Day. The pier is lacking in maintenance and the board are starting to wear down. My service dog got his foot caught and I fell. There are not many good food choices anymore either. Disappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenandike
50,What fun,"Came here with friends, spent the day walking along the pier taking photos with the amazing views. Just a short walk from the centre.There is a fair with rides, shops, bar areas for fishing and benches to stop and soak up the atmosphere.We watched a street magician and had photos with the route 66 sign.The beach has to be the biggest i have seen and so clean too.We spent two nights in Santa Monica and loved it here. Drove to Hollywood Universal around an hour away and stopped off for a walk down the walk of fame too.Ate dinner on the pier in Bubba Gumps which was brilliant and i would definitely recommend. You can sit near the window and have a perfect view of the sun set. I would book a table though for sure.Can't wait to return...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samanthap865
50,Japanese Hot Dogs!!!!,Heard about the specialty Japanese Hot dogs on the Pierre. They have many different kinds but the Original Japanese Hot Dogs was the BEST! Definitely eat when you are at Santa Monica Pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soccrmd
40,Perfect on a sunny Sunday,Highly recommend the pier for a sunny Sunday stroll pre or post brunch.Lots to see and some great views. Funfair for the thrill seekers and many other options for less adventurous. Watch the fishermen at the end of the pier or grab something to eat at Bubba Gumps.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisB392
40,The Pier,"A nice time on the rides. The food is very overpriced and average at best. Also, lines for rides can be long at times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelchernick
50,Breathtaking,"Beautiful venue with local artists performing. It's a very unique place that I've seen in TV and movies my whole life and it was great to see it in person. It has something for everyone in your family with amusement rides, great dining and bar options, and shopping. The fishing seemed to be good as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PSmith5407
50,Nice pier,"Had everything you'd expect from a pier , rides food etc. Easy location to get to from all hotels on Santa Monica front. Preferred this pier compared to pier 69 @ San Fran.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheffieldmiller
50,Nice place to relax,"Lots of attractions, bars & restaurants. Don't forget about amusement park. Sometimes bit too crowdy but still worth visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaGPL
40,Neat to see,The carosel and the ferris wheel at night are the best parts. It was neat to see but nothing extradorinary. Very crowded on the weekends but a great place for pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erawson77
50,Love it,"I really enjoyed spending time on Santa Monica Pier especially at night. It's quite busy but if you're happy just wondering around it has a great atmosphere- not even a child vomiting in front of me in the ice cream line wiped the smile off my face. We went on the little roller coaster which was a bit of fun and there's a nice view up there. (The old wooden boards are uneven to walk on, flats recommended).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KaseyNicole369
50,a must see,"one of the best places to visit in cali. It was so much fun, the rides were worth it, and they had great food. There were also many performers and it was nice seeing so many different things in one place. The artists were great, I recommend getting a painting done. they are really talented and don't charge much",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/398yasmini
40,"Busy, traditional pier",We visited this traditional pier with its funfair and wooden boards in the summer as part of our Californian road trip. It is a must stop for anyone travelling Route 66 and fans of the Smokey and the Bandit/ Cannonball Run films!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joyu73
50,"A must in LA, a nice walk before or after lunch, very Californian","For me it is the nicest beach to spend a day, not so isolated as Malibu and different kind than Venice beach.It has everything restaurants, luna park, beach, nice views to stroll around and..thousands of people.. can NOT be missed",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fcortina
30,Like the movies,"Very touristy place, but you must see it. It's interesting all different kind of people that you can see around. There is a small roll coaster, that you have a great views of the beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carlalr0510
50,A wander back in time and Forrest Gump,Thoroughly enjoyed our wander up and down the pier. Took our photos at the end of route 66 and at the Forrest Gump bench. Life's a box of chocolates and all that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewfB3406VH
40,Iconic destination by the sea,This is an iconic destination that can be enjoyed by night or day. At night it comes to life with all the lights of the ferris wheel and the roller coaster along with all the other attractions. Lots of good food places to enjoy and take in the view,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelfausttravogal
30,Tacky,One visit was enough!Lots of tacky shops and stalls.We wanted to visit because it's the end of Route 66. Pretty disappointing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/659francesg
20,Terrible,"Nothin more than an tourist trap - not worth going unless you enjoy crowds, uncountable performers and souvenir shops",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PR_S18
50,Iconic scenery,"The view was great and after seeing in so many movies and video games I had to visit. I actually came twice. Once at day and once at night... and I totally recommend both! I didn't eat or play or shop, just walked around and I found that enjoyable enough. The restrooms are easy to access and clean... major plus!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarileesTravels
40,"Nice hangout buzzing with activities, specially in evenings","I liked the pier a lot - lots of things happening, great weather, buzzing with activities, right from street dancers to food. Its nice for a few hours of getaway.Parking wasnt too bad either.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arahul
50,Santa Monica lifestyle,"Please make a point to include any visit to So. Cal with spending part of a day here, as well as Venice Beach. Words only describe what your own opinion will far outweigh.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L5156HBdavida
50,Should definitely visit!!,"Beautiful views, lots of fun activities for children, definitely the place to see when visiting Santa Monica. Had the opportunity to take great photos of the coastline.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheWorldTraveler2025
30,Gorgeous Walk,"I really enjoyed Santa Monica Pier. Overall it had a great vibe, and nobody really came across rude. We went at night and it was gorgeous all lit up. We never got a chance to go on the ferris wheel. I can't remember if it was already closed or what it was.Busy, busy, busy. There's always people running around, music playing, lots of talking, so it's not a quiet place by any means.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samantham5914
50,In the night - spectacular,Was running along this Pier in the evening! Truly to say - its very spectacular:! A lot of lights! Just amazing!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kirysic
50,REALLY FUN place,This is a touristy but wonderful place to visit for all ages. There's a handful of amusement park rides. My daughter (22) and I rode the ferries wheel that has the most incredible views of both the ocean and beach. There's lots to eat and drink and there's a large pier. There was a seal hanging out in the water at the end of the pier while we were watching street performers. Highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M3427FIwilliams
40,A very interesting place,"The Pier is a must see. If only to stand by the ""End of Route 66"" sign and have your photo taken. Have a bite at Bubba Gump Shrimp for a nostalgic trip down Forrest lane. The vendors are helpful and not very expensive and the general feeling of the area is one of merriment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/245henrym
50,Awsome walk!!,"Went for a nice walk down the Pier, infortunetly we got there alittle too late and basically everthing was already closed, but besides that it was really really nice!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shagg2016
40,Fantastic pier,Overall just a really nice pier with an amazing beach. There's rides on the pier which we didn't go on but many other little stalls. A few food options which again we didn't try as not all were open as we went around 10am and think most open around 12.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seanoldinho
30,Great view but distracting noise,Went here recently with my husband. I had been when I was younger but he has never been. We went at night and during the day and both times the people on the pier making noise or singing killed the atmosphere and view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/terrat014
50,A fun park on a pier,"Lots to enjoy when the sun is out in its typical California fashion.Being able to enjoy the sea, beach as well as the rides makes this a special spot to visit with kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MyJetGuru
30,Tourist attraction,"Typical tourist attraction with a midway, cheesy local restaurants, vendors, T-shirt shops, an arcade, etc.Worth seeing once. End of Route 66. No need to come back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ALML58
50,Still a must do!,"Some people may consider doing the pier as a bit cheesy, but it is such a beautiful location and the view out to sea is just gorgeous. Whenever I have work colleagues out with me who haven't been to the area I drive them down to the area for a wander around.Sadly there is a large street homeless community that live along the road side where you park, so the contrast between the 'haves' & the 'have nots' is stark, but sadly this is a sign of the times we live in.Make the effort to park a little way from the pier and walk down the beach front for the maximum impact. Then walk out to the end to see the Pacific!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanteandDougie
40,Nice,"Just like the pictures, not more than that either, but just good enough to have some lunch and buy souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vale_go11
50,Santa Monica Must-Do,"It's such a cliche thing to do, but you have to enjoy the small things in life! The quirky amusement park was very busy, but you could still easily walk around and explore the pier. Lots of tourists and visitors who don't speak English- a great opportunity to meet new people!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/999kayleen
50,Great stay,"Have to get to the pier at sundown. Lots of energy, Ferris wheel gives you a great view of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mkceak
50,Santa Monica is a must see,I love this place so much fun and the pier is the cream on top it has great shopping great weather and beautiful sunsets as you eat at many of the great restaurants near the beach plus a lot of great people watching we stayed right across from the pier and at night the pier lights up it looks amazing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cathyw604
30,A Nice Stop on the Pacific Coast Hwy,"My husband and I enjoyed our journey down the pier. There was plenty of entertainment with musicians every 30 yards or so. They are usually pretty good, too.There are plenty of souvenirs at a decent price. This is where we got some gifts for family back home. There are rides as well, including the only solar powered ferries wheel in the world.I would highly recommend reading the historical information about the pier. This can be found near the end of the pier on signs along the building.One of the unique facts we discovered is that the inspiration for the character Popeye came from a sailor who was out of the Santa Monica pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/555heathere
30,NOT impressed,Allot of awful street performers and souvenir shops. Great food at Rustys Surf and Turf. Glad we did the pier before heading to Hollywood /LA. We spent about 2hrs including lunch. Not worth the time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LettA2
10,Very touristy,"Not what it used to be , too many people and the person really looked tired , parking made difficult by a nasty attendant who insisted on making me park where he wanted , despite. Any empty spaces , I won't be back !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/700harvey
30,Trip to cali,We visited the pier after dark. The kids had a good amount of carnival type fun. It was more fun just being in a different spot together I think. That night the power went out while ppl were on rides and didn't come back on. It was quite scary for my 5 yr old but overall we had fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimberlywY299YK
50,Saturday night must!,"We walked to the pier from our hotel and had a ball! Great people watching, wonderful musicians and artists. The Ferris wheel was beautiful. We had a seafood supper at Albrights. Yum! Many great restaurants to choose from plus delish ice cream and lemonade. It's amazing at night!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ranfan6
50,A fun date-night idea.,"We visited here twice during our recent trip to California. We arrived around sunset and got some amazing photos of the beach and pier. Weekdays are quieter, I would recommend visiting on a weekend if you're keen to try out the rides, as this part is open later on weekends. It's a perfect date night, fairground rides, arcade games, talented buskers, romantic scenery. Every now and then you'll notice a herd of people running from one end of the pier to the other. This likely means a rare Pokemon has appeared.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TotemGirl
50,Beach days,"Beautiful! Live music, even caught the sunset. There was the spot where Tom hanks from forest gump opened up the bubba shrimp place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carinam123
50,Brings back memories from movie days of old.,The board walk needs some replacement. But the views are great and several restaurants are excellent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAR817
40,Must visit,We were here on a busy and crowded Sunday night. Obviously popular with locals and tourists alike. Some nice music being played live. Must go at least once.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scott8147
40,Sunny Beach Day,Wentbwith a friend to chedk out the beach. We choose a nice sunny day but wasnt too hot. We spent about an hour walking along the pier looking at the souvenir shops and out over the ocean. Its a great place to get some nice photos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keelia_1221
50,Fun and Classic,"It's exactly as expected - fun, frivolous and just what you want on a California evening. The colors sights and sounds are all spectacular and just plain special. It's not to be missed - a REAL California spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KShawnT
40,Fun,It was fun the scenery is beautiful and if you like shopping it's very close to that my kids love the Ferris wheel in playing some of the games even though it was a little bit expensive it was a lot of fun,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zipdoodah123
40,Santa Monica Pier,Great place to take a walk after having lunch or dinner in Santa Monica.Wonderful place to bring visitors to see the world famous Pier full of arcades food and views up and down the coast.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I805VJtonyv
40,Great for kids,Our kids thoroughly enjoyed the pier. I have no idea why they don't open until around 11 or noon - wish they opened earlier - messes up kids that are still young and need a mid day nap. Prices were reasonable and parking was easy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisS679
50,Very crowded but a must do,Pier is always a fun time with concerts and events! If you are touristing than this is a definite stop and see he beauty awaiting here - fun times,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonyswimmin
50,"Old, but it has history.","We got off our bus tour for a few hours at the Santa Monica Pier. It is very old so don't expect modern things. I think this gives it some panache. You have the ferris wheel and rides, but it gives you that ""old-timey"" feeling of going to fairs, etc. when you were growing up. It probably could use a little facelift, but we had fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tammyl523
40,Entertainment,"Always a fun experience to be on the pier at night with the lights and ocean breeze. The sights, sounds and smells are unique to this pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/573deannea
40,Very Nice Place for Photo,The Santa Monica Pier is a pretty nice place to take some photos and you can also purchase souvenirs there. It's a must-visit especially if you're on transit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/awinsomelife
40,"It's like going to the State Fair, only on a pier!","We were impressed by how much they were able to fit on this pier- I felt like I was at the State Fair with all the games and rides. We got custards at Route 66 while we walked around and played some skeet ball. Only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was because the bathrooms were disgusting, so pee before you go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahSeestheWorld
40,Cool place to see,"My wife, son (11) and I toured the Santa Monica Pier on a Sunday in November. Our only complaint was parking, the Pier parking was full ($12) so after we circled for a bit, we gave up and pulled into the lobster to park. It was $30, but it was right at the front walkway to the Pier. As we walked down to the Pier we noticed a HUGE parking lot down on the beach that you couldn't see from the main road. I think you have to access it from the Pacific Coast Hwy. We'd definitely park there next time because it was right on the beach beside the Pier and from what we could see from afar, about $18 for the day.The Pier was a cool place to see. The amusement park was for little kids (<8 years old), so we only did the Pacific Wheel. Definitely recommended since the view of the beach and the Pier was amazing, took lots of pictures. After the pier we walked down to the ocean to take some more scenic pics. All in all it was a nice relaxing day with tons to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/127davism
50,People watching galore and a ferris wheel!,"I didn't think I would enjoy this visit as much as I did as the pier looked so tacky from a distant with it's carnival and touristy appearance. But, hey, I was a tourist--so I just relaxed and took in all the smells, noise, crowds, street performances and beautiful views!The first thing you find when visiting the pier is that it is surrounded by lots and lots of free parking, which is amazing in itself. No stress driving around looking for parking. Next you get to stroll along a flat sidewalk towards the pier taking in the incredible wide and miles long beach. This is the brief introduction to the pier as you get to do some great people watching while they run, walk and bike by in all kinds of different and interesting outfits. As you walk onto the pier you catch the excitement of the children as they point excitedly towards the carnival rides and the giant ferris wheel. Reminds me of state fairs I attended as a child, and later with my children. There is something for everyone there. Shops, food and merchandise kiosks and restaurants line the pier and there were many excellent street performers. At the end of the dock you can watch the fishermen and look way out onto the horizon and spot fishing boats. There was even a seal diving and coming up for fish that entertained us for a while. Lots of benches to sit and listen and people watch. Walking back to your car go via the water, take off your shoes and feel the sand! Easy access via stairs and bridges over the freeway to visit nearby downtown Santa Monica and more restaurants and shopping!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TartanCat57
20,Very dirty and rundown,"We had our hopes set high for this and it was a big letdown. We thought it was going to be better than the Santa Cruz Pier we say a few days prior and it was no where near it. It was run down, lots of street vendors everywhere and just low end shops. It does provide a nice view out to the ocean and of the beach but that's about it. Would have definitely not made the time for it, if we knew this is what it was going to be. We ended up going to Long Beach and loved it better so stayed down there vs here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/klein3
10,If you like bums,"Skanky. Old. Not good. Avoid and go to Santa Cruz instead. The beach is ok, but the fair is old and small and there is a lot of homeless (not blaming them, but the American culture)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Manf27
50,Not to be Missed,"The Pier in Santa Monica is alive. It was a beautiful evening and the pier offered a wide variety of things to do. We enjoyed ice cream and wide ranging fun. The amusement park is great for kids, but the scene off the end of the pier at sunset is something not to be missed. Even if the pier were not the end of the famed Route 66, a visit is a must do when visiting the LA area. I recommend parking in Santa Monica and walking down to the pier. Although there is parking next to the pier, walking down from Santa Monica provides scenic views and perspectives.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rjdoan
50,Wonderful,"I think we did this weekend backwards. The pier is so zen. Great violin music, beautiful water. The girls are enjoying the rides. We should have stated here to get my zen on. The bathrooms are super clean too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FarAway580183
50,The end of the route,"The end of Route 66, and I know it's brimming with tourists, but it's hard not to love the pier and its entertainment. It stretches into the Pacific and bisects two wonderfully picturesque beaches and stunning coast scenery.Vibrant is the word for the pier and it can now be so easily reached by metro from downtown LA.Take time out to visit, be a tourist and take in the beach life that is synonymous with California. The downtown Santa Monica shopping is worth the visit too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/300nickyc
50,Day at the pier,Just to go walk and see different places to eat and lil shops to explore is what you get at Santa monica... a lot of kids tho so not too much on the peaceful side... but still good for the food!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/7marleenm
50,Family trip,This was a great choice to bring my grandson to be loved it. He had never been to the ocean before so it was quite an experience for him.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beccihuffman
50,Nice view,Perfect view and local to invest some good time. Also good points to grab sone snacks and continue the trip,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hugotamura
50,Extra Nice,The Santa Monica Pier was really nice and had a carnival atmosphere . Great for family's and even seniors to enjoy themselves.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joycep883
30,Walking on the pier to view beach life and experience pierviews,"Many shops, and people walking here. Great view on Santa Monica beach and hotels. Attractive to bring kids if you are travelling with family and try on roller coaster etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AK687
50,Santa Monica Pier,"Fabulously friendly, safe, clean! Lots of fun activities for the family! Several public bathroom facilities! Food & drinks are available including adult beverages! Super close to beach entrances! Sensational shopping!!! Beautiful at sunset or sunrise! Spectacular sight @ night! Love it!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TiffanieMPiker
50,Fantastic....,This pier is everything I imagined it to be... its a 'must do' whist in Los Angeles plenty for the children to see and do little stalls..small fairground..ice creams etc. everything you expect to see on a traditional pier..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A5916JAsusanm
20,Disappointed,"Let's start with it was a Wednesday in November. We went to purchase tickets at 5:15 pm. The little kids area was closing in 15 minutes, hours early. They said that the other rides close at 7. They had only 4 of the rides open with 1 operator going between 2 of the rides( figured this out after complaining). They abruptly closed ALL rides at 6:30 with no explanation. They were still selling tickets with 4 rides running at full price at 6 pm. All the games in the little kids are were closed the entire time we were there. I understand labor and sales, but there were people willing to purchase tickets. No one wants to spend $30 on 1 ticket with 3 1/2 rides working.......it was a beautiful night with temps in the upper 70's after a 85+ day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brown0928
10,Over stated,Better off staying at the Venice beach boardwalk. This was over priced and underwhelming. You are constantly attacked by pigeons if you try and eat there and the theme Park cost $100 per person for a hsndfull of C grade rides which were all empty as it would seem we were not the only people who thought it was a waste of money.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevenroy
50,Bit tired!,Nice but a bit tired! Could do with an update.Nice little stalls with souvenirs and the views for sunset are recommended!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FionaStorey
50,Forgot how awesome the Pier is!,"Haven't been back in years but in the eyes of my two year old niece, I fell in love with it again. The kid in you will always love here, then add the buzz, the buskers, good food.....Sheesh, I'm missing it already❤️",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/terenceo541
30,Still the same,"This pier is the same as it wss 10 years ago. It is still a tourist trap, and everything is expensive on the pier. Everything looks rundown and even sketchy(meaning a lot of homeless and gang members around it).The only plus is that it has a great view from the end of it. The best time to visit, is mid morning to mid afternoon, on a weekday, in the Fall, when the Santa Ana winds are blowing. You will encounter very few people and clear skies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CentralCoastWine
40,Santa Monica pier,"Nice walk to the pier, lots of buskers and people selling touristy things, bubba gump seat good to get a pic of, there is an amusement faculty $8 us for roller coaster ride, most places for snacks shut a 9 worth seeing the end of Route 66 👍🏻",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/286trevr
40,Go For The History and The Great Photos,"Take photos of the End of Route 66 sign, the arched Santa Monica Pier sign, the ocean, Santa Monica, the Carousel, etc. Buy some souvenirs. Enjoy the ocean at the end of the pier. There are also ""street"" performers there, singing to a Karaoke machine, playing guitar, etc. For parking, weekdays are better. You can park next to the pier or even on the pier. Some kids will try to shake you down for money. One came up to me as I was buying an iced tea and asked me for a few dollars. I told him to sell the skateboard he was holding. I'm very generous to genuine people in need. This kid was not in need. Don't fall for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Songbird811
50,Worth visiting,"If you're an Aussie, make sure you slather on the sunblock before heading to the pier. The sun is completely different to ours, I got fried, and it didn't even feel that hot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oddbotts
50,Evening visit-go during the day,"We headed over to the Pier after a day of sightseeing. Parking was easy and plentiful on the Pier. It was a beautiful night to walk and observe the lighted ferries wheel, shops, and restaurants, however I would of preferred being there during the day to view the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryBM53
30,Boring hot and sticky,Bit of a let down..nothing but tacky touristy souvenirs for sale..lovely views. But not at all what i was expecting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buglesChchNewZealand
50,Views,"Very clean and beautiful. Parking wasn't too bad in price and you can park right by the beach. Lots of options for food, as well as places to get souvenirs. Many places to sit or stand to enjoy the ocean. We went on a Wednesday and there weren't many people so that was nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaitlin8899
50,Expensive but great!,"The pier is very clean and lively!We paid to ride the Ferris wheel because we knew the views would be worth it. It was pretty expensive to ride, and I imagine if you had a family it would get super pricey! But the view was totally worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaytravel82
40,Crowded and Foggy,"While in California I had the opportunity to visit the Santa Monica Piers. The weather was beautiful but there some fog that was over casting the closer you got to the water. To me it was crowded like Coney Island boardwalk in New York City. Lots of people. Lots of activities going on. I enjoyed the Santa Monica Strip. The different restaurants and other establishments. If you happen to go on the weekend, I suggest you park in the municipal parking lot. The max was $5.00. During the week it's more. Most people don't know so they tend to park at the meters which are limited to 2 or 3 hours at a time. What a nice drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/92glorial
40,Fun afternoon,"It felt nostalgic to walk around the pier it reminded my of my childhood. There are kids rides and midway games. A few restaurants a lot of souvenir kiosks, local musicians, and artist. The view is fabulous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MBQ_13
40,Fun and Sun!,"The Santa Monica Pier is a must visit if in Los Angeles, food, fun, sun and great amusement rides, so iconic and seen in many movies. Third Street Promenade is a short two blocks away for lots of shopping, food and other services. Lots of parking, beaches, easy access.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thaddt
30,Underwhelming,"Whilst the pier has great views and is worth a visit, the whole experience is a little underwhelming, the buildings and general look could be a much higher standard and we didn't feel comfortable to walk under the pier along the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MJW94
30,Getting pretty tired,"We were here about 6 years ago, and nothings changed. The shops and eateries are just as run down. I guess you don't come here for a MacDonald's restaurant experience? You come here to sample a snapshot of American culture, and there's plenty of it to see in all its undignified glory! Still a memorable, but certainly not uplifting experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulE433
50,Loved the Pier,Lots to do on the pier and wonderful places to eat. Amazing performers near the beach and ocean. Don't forget to take some cash!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missouritravel5
50,Santa Monica pier,"Went for a walk, lots of people, shops, rides, tourists, beautiful seaside views, end of route 66 sign, where scenes from the movie 'Lost Boys' was set, grear spot for photos",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzannek413
50,Fun at night,Was able to try the ferris wheel with my cousins. Loved the vibe. I would've loved to go back during daytime just to see the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveleeT
50,O liked it,Very nice. It is a great place to make tourism. Very nice food. Beautiful souvenirs. People from every countries. The bay is beautiful too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tito6399
40,Good to say we've done it,We arrived early for a tour and started in Santa Monica and walked down to the pier. Not a lot to see but worth doing to say you've done it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellyjane2015
40,A different experience every time,"This was our 3rd visit to the Santa Monica Pier over the years and I must say it was different from the last 2 visits. This time, the crowd was unbelievable. It was actually difficult to walk without bumping into people. The lines to get food/snacks were crazy long. We did wait in line to get a churro, which actually took about 30 minutes. We walked all the way out to the end and found a spot where we could stand for a few minutes to get away from the crowd. A lot of the people were playing Pokemon, so they were looking down at their electronic devices as they walked around. This was amusing for a while, but then became annoying! The views of the sunset over the ocean and views of the ferris wheel at night are beautiful, but I'm not sure it's worth it to fight the crowd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TNHarleyChick
40,Loved the pier,"The Santa Monica Pier is anything but boring. Except for the great ocean view and smell, there are many activities going on there. Kids park , artists selling their art, good restaurants - you name it..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AvivBarak
40,Very pleasant visit!,"Musicians of all types playing at the pier, with great ocean views, fun games and a variety of food options.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elianaw_13
50,Good times.,"Lots of fun for the family. Dont forget to bring your wallet! The food, souvenirs, and activities are on the pricy side but it's one of those places that you have got to check out if you're in Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xavierx101
10,Yuck,"We visited here last night with our older son and found the pier to be filthy, tacky, crowded and definitely not worth a visit. Maybe seeing it during the day would have been better but all 3 of us agreed we wished we hadn't wasted the time to park and walk down there. Thought it was an added ""plus"" that when we were almost to the pier and went over by the trees to take a picture, we almost stumbled over 3 homeless people as well as about a dozen rats. Disgusting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/northernNYM
30,"Pretty from my hotel, but crowded.","This place was packed the Friday night we walked from the Lowes. The view if the Pacific is nice from the Pier, but I would have preferred to spend my time away from the crowd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abhurley
40,The nicest Pier,"I love Santa Monica Pier, it the nicest Pier the I've ever visited. I visited Ventura Pier yesterday but it's nice but does not have the buzz of Santa Monica Pier. Oh there is more on Santa Monica Pier including Bubba Grump fish restaurant and there are the amusements for children and adults alike. The Pier is magical when it's lit up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/motorcar1
50,Pier,Marks the end of Route 66!Worth going just for the signCouple of restaurants on the pierThere's a fun fair with coaster and Ferris wheel.Usually live music during the eveningYou can see fishermen and sometimes a seal or two hunting for their dinner!Nice environment,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A7067SJmarkd
30,"Lots to do, but pure insanity","When we went, it was so dense with people that it sucked most of the fun out of it for me. I'm told it's often that insane. We ended up leaving the boardwalk and walking along the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LostGator09
30,Underwhelmed,We had previously visited Santa Monica however missed getting to the Pier which we regretted. So recently we had a couple of days to spare at the end of our vacation and made our way to Santa Monica primarily to visit the Pier. We joined the masses (end of summer) and walked to the Pier a short distance from our hotel. On getting to the Pier itself it was a collection of tacky retail outlets and some rides. Nothing stands out as a WOW moment. If you are in the area then pay a visit but I would not go out of my way to see it. I think it could do with a major refurbishment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foster_0998
50,An enjoyable stroll alog the pier,The weather was perfect for our visit to the pier - clear skies & sunshine which of course added to the appeal of the pier. People-watching & sea-gazing amog buskers & stalls made this alovely way to spend a few hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Julee14
40,Everybody loves the pier,"There is something for everyone to do on Santa Monica Pier. It is showing its age, but it is still one of the best places to watch the waves and enjoy the sunset, Young people have plenty of choices for boardwalk rides when they are not enjoying the water. A few people were checking out some waves which were ok for surfing, There are plenty of boardwalk foods from seafood to hot dogs to pretzels to name a few. The EXPO line of the Metro system takes you from downtown LA right to the beach, no hassle, no parking charges, all for less than $4 roundtrip, much less for elders..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CyndyandByron
50,"Eautiful view, great formpeople watching",Spent a little over an hour in the evening here while on the way to LAX. Great place to watch the sunset. Food stands everywhere. Live music every few feet. Beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean. I would say this is a great place in which to spend an evening.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/676rosab
40,Ride the ferris wheel,"The pier has lots of restaurants and shops which stretch the length of the pier. There are some rides, I avoided the expensive and short rollercoaster, but decided to take a sunset ride on the Ferris wheel. It was fun and an beautiful view. Its crowded and changes to a stranger crowd after dark. Overall positive and worth the time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hayleyj797
30,So California,"The pier is fun to walk. There are vendors, food and carnival type rides. It you walk to the end there is a nice view of the Pacific Ocean. We were there on a Saturday and even though it was foggy and November it was still very crowded. Seems to be the place to be for regulars as well as tourists. Nice to see if you are in Southern California and have some time to spare.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wwjd1947
30,It's alright,A lot is going on. Maybe because I had been to it once. I was more taken with the Pier itself the first time. Second time. It just seemed like a Pier with lots around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RTworld3
20,Looks better from a distance,We visited the pier at the end of Oct and have to admit to being a little disappointed with it. The Ferris wheel was lit up but closed as were a number of the stalls and it was only 7:30pm. Not much to see except the Route 66 sign. Worth the visit but don't build your hopes up. The police station is pretty cool ..... from the outside!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gillo1200
40,Fun way to spend a few hours,"A stroll along the pier, enjoying a funnel cake and possibly a ride on the ferris wheel is a nice way to spend an afternoon. We watched the sunset as well and strolled on the beach! Nice!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jano545
50,Good brief trip,Went on big wheel and rollercoaster. Great fun! There was the usual range of tacky gift shops but a nice cafe at the end of the pier with a good live musician. Nice view at sunset.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robertbev
30,Touristic attraction but worth it,"I didn't expext it to be so touristic and full of people, but I think it's cool place to walk around. Nothing special, but great attraction to take nice pics.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hamansku

50,Love this pier!,This was my second time to this pier and I couldn't wait to show my the Santa Monica sunset from the pier! She loved it! I enjoyed it for a second time. This time we bought tickets to ride the world's only solar-powered ferris wheel on the pier and that gave us a wonderful view as well. A delightful evening!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennalynnwarner

50,Quick trip to the pier,"Went out to the pier for something to do and thought it was a lovely place. Beach was clean, the view was wonderful, and there were lots of entertainment and dining options.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/444gretchenb
30,Not a great place for a toddler on a weekend,I hadn't been to the Los Angeles area in nearly ten years so I thought the pier would be a fun place to visit with my 2-year-old daughter. We went on a Saturday afternoon and it was complete mayhem. I'm sure it's a great place to visit during the week but in the future I'll steer clear of the pier with or without a toddler on the weekends.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sflaherty
50,Full of memories,"I spent my childhood in and around the Pier. Everything from the carousel to the hot dog on a stick are fond places to recall. There used to be a ballroom on the south side called The Aragon Ballroom. The original Muscle Beach was a really big deal. Good times, better memories",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joannf618
50,"Been there, Done that",Wanted to see this and glad we did. But too many people! ! And it was Tuesday! Excellent beach and boardwalk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/968maryannet

50,My Favorite Place,"I go to Santa Monica Pier one to three times a week! That's how much I love this place!Best time for Me to go- early am around 5am, which when it's a really light crowd of Fishermen, Walkers, Runners, Security, and Me. Everyone waves and speaks, it's like a second home.I prefer watching the sunrise as the birds skim the water and I've seen a few Seals as I sit on the end of the Pier.Of course I also go during the busy times so I can hear some amazing music, see some great Artists, and People watch. There are definitely some Stars on the Pier!!!It's pretty busy on weekends, lighter crowd during the week, and seems a date night for many couples.Families love the Pier with rides, rollercoaster, snacks, and games. I've had a fun ride on the rollercoaster many times with the kids! Every now and then I jump on to catch the view and hear the kids laughter, it's such a good time.I'll see You at the Santa Monica Pier!I Love YouZulekha Williams",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zulekhaw
40,A walk on the pier,"The Santa Monica Pier is a must visit when traveling to the coast. It is the 'End of the Trail' of the Famous Route 66. I suggest going there during the day on a week day. The weekends are just to crowded. Even then it is a great people watching place. Families, couples, fishermen, street artist decorate the trail. It is a great place to get that best vacation photo. Be sure to walk to the end, since you are here you must see the whole thing! If you have a child along are a child at heart there are rides - the Ferris wheel, roller coaster and bumper cars. Some fairly good food available too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shotinthedark1956
40,Great place for families,"The pier gets extremely busy during summer, not so bad when we went in December. Plenty to do for young children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SilkeN674
50,END OF ROUTE 66 VIBRANT FUN PLACE TO VISIT,The pier was bust and is the end of route 66. A variety of restaurants and fun rides for both adults and children. street entertainers were preforming and a fab place to watch the sun sink into the ocean,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helen_greig
40,Nice pier with lots to do,"Drove about 20 min, which was nice and scenic. Always fun to see what people are catching off the pier. The kids played some games. Some are a rip off but it's to be expected. The rides don't start till noon, FYI. Weather was nice. To park it is cash only. Quick little stop, but worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TAMARALAPIP
40,Lovely day trip,"We took the metro from downtown LA to Santa Monica Pier, great value at $7 day ticket on the metro.Lots of entertainment with singers on the pier & so much to see. A lovely family trip here, make sure you take a trip here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zoel931
50,Tacky but iconic,"Well it's a pier - but it's THE pier. All sorts of fairground stuff, tacky shops, food outlets of dubious quality, forest Gump bench and fake shoes, the end of Route 66. Anywhere else you'd like it but that's all but this is Santa Monica baby and it's just awesome, especially for an overseas visitor. Been there three times and love going back. I do recommend a visit at first light when it's quiet and the ocean is calm. Just love it. Visit and enjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ianmL3705ZS
50,Lovely pier,"Great views, great rides. Really loved walking around and along the beach. Stunning beach stroll from Venice to Santa Monica. Loads of great Restaurants not far from the pier",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nikkistravelmap
50,Fun time!,"The Santa Monica Pier is a fun place to go. Located right at the west end of Old Route 66! Shops, restaurants (including Bubba Gumps from the movie Forrest Gump). We enjoyed seeing the beautiful sunset from the end of the pier. There is also a small amusement park with the world's oldest solar powered carousel. In the evening the carousel has an amazing light display.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/punkn49
50,Beautiful Pier,"Great views from the pier. There are shops, food and a few rides. There are musicians playing and singing, fishermen and dog walkers. We bought some shirts for a pretty good price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaG618
30,Best in the early morning,"I have never been to the pier at any other time of day, but that's not going to stop me from declaring that 6-7 AM is the best time to visit. The stores and rides are closed and the sky is dark, but the bright lights of the rides are still on against the deep blue sky, making beautiful reflections in the ocean. The pier is clean and smells of ocean instead of fried food and people. It's very romantic in the idyllic sense of the word. Once the sun is up, the romance disappears and it's just a tiny little tourist trap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Laene
40,Brings you back in time,The pier is kind of fun as you remember your days at amusement parks in iconic America. It's definitely worth the stop and the ferris wheel at sunset if you can make it happen is awesome!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BTBoston
50,"Preferred SM Pier atmosphere (+ Sunset) to Pier 39 in San Fran, quality entertainment, End of Route 66.","Loved this Pier.A bit tricky to acess the longstay car park when traveling North - we drove up from Marina del Rey - but there is a park on the pier itself which works out a tad cheaper if you're staying for an hour or 2 although it's a tad small.Thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere and heard some of the best entertainers ever! Clare Means especially, but also an amazing hawaian/slide style guitarist at the end of the pier.Several places to eat with prices a little inflated cos it is an iconic atraction after all. The fun fair with big wheel looked good but we didn't try it. Just wandered up and down on a couple of occasions soaking in the atmosphere, sunshine and fresh air. Sunset from the Pier SO special!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pontefract
50,Paddy,"Fantastic, no other words to describe experience, you just have to go there, photos don't do it justice, fancy fishing at sunset off the pier, yes you can, get a photo with Forrest Grump at the end of Route 66 yes you can, at lest a picture of his ""boots""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/327paddyb

40,Fun for everyone,"While I didn't spend a lot of time here, it was very enjoyable just looking around and taking it all in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vickikersey
50,Awesome,"It's a very crowded place since it's so famous but the beauty of it surpasses all the problems that may come with lots of people. Parking is very expensive and short term parking lot is incredibly small and always full. Lots of atractions over the pier, access to beach, food, awesome view of the Ocean and the city. Metro gets you right there in case you want to ride and not drive. Be careful with souvenir shops, walk all the way to the end of the pier where you will find the cheapest ones (and still overpriced)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Victor2591975
30,It's all right,It was exactly what I expected. I mean in the end of the day it's just e pier :). But it's a nice place to walk around get some good food and enjoy your day around the beach. If you have few hours to spare that's your place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mr_Epoz
50,Absouletly beautiful,"This place is unique. The weather is great, the place is full and lively, you will see lots of people walking around, singing, dancing, fishing - it was a nice experience and the best part was the most amazing sunset! Don't miss it. Parking in adjacent lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/made1024
40,A true tourist attraction,"People everywhere - locals and travellers alike. Vibrant, energetc, interesting and fun - put it on your 'must visit' list when in Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timmZ1486ND
50,Route 66- End of the Road.,We chose Santa Monica to visit the SM Pier and check this off our bucket list. We were not disappointed. Very safe at night and lots of nice looking restaurants and bars nearby. Took pictures and enjoyed people watching. Drove down to Venice Beach- lots of difference. Very dark and a little scary just driving around. Passed walking around- SM seemed much safer and glad we stayed there. Daytime would be better at VB. Overall very happy we stayed an extra day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/872wallacec
30,Visit Once,"You have to visit this iconic sight once. We were very disappointed with the Pier, thought there would be more excitement. But we figured it was the time of year and days during the week that we visited. It might be quite impressive during the summer and weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IsaacB672
10,Expected so much more,"Thought Santa Monica pier would be on par with pier 39 in San Fran not a patch,dirty rundown place seen it wouldn't go back !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ljcoolk
30,not as expected,"I was hoping to see a place buzzing with people in a Carnival like fashion but was met with a place that was more snoring rather than buzzing. I guess I was a victim of mu own expectations. Small entertainment place, old rides, and few options on food. You should go here for the beach and wind, not for the rides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/docronp
40,"Lively, iconic pier","The pier is full of things to see and do. Although it only needs an hour or so to fully explore. It's bustling and lively both day and night.One evening we ate in the Mexican at the very far end. Food was good and not as expensive as a lot of the restaurants in Santa Monica. They have a good value kids menu too. During the day we ate at one of the hot dog fast food restaurants, which was ok.We didn't do any of the main rides as they were quite pricy ($8 per person for the big wheel & there were 4 of us!) But the kids did really enjoy the beautiful old fashion indoor carousel which was only a couple of dollars. And we had a browse round the tourist shops and took in the beautiful view.We parked in the huge, empty car park by Muscle Beach (a 5 minute stroll away) for $8 a day. I believe the pier parking is more expensive and always seemed really busy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CJxxxx
40,Iconic landmark,"Santa Monica pier is an iconic landmark and was on my bucket list to visit. Lovely views over the beach , lots of people watching. The Ferris wheel at the end of the pier is great to take photos. Along the pier there are shops, cafes and restaurants. The pier looked beautiful lit up at night",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mozzy65
50,A mini vacation,Just arrived to California will ne here for7 days and checked out the Cali beaches since I am from Atlanta wanted to check them out. The pier was beautiful with a ton of carnival games and rides. Me and the husband played skiball and rode the rollercoaster which was fun since we are adrenaline junkies...were able to see the sunset overall great experience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/943sashac
40,Great crowded place for families with kids and visitors,"Must see jetty for families. Many public rest rooms, live music, gift shops, diners and a large amusement park with ferries wheel and small roller coaster.Entry from freeway and paid parking is around $12 per vehicle flat rate incl motorcycles.Visit this place and then head to the Venice canals for a complete day out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Unalicious
10,Tacky,Perhaps it would have been nicer if the weather was better. However it was just tacky.Walked to the end once then left. Lots of homeless sleeping at the entrance to the flyover. Give it a miss.....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TimfromMonty
30,Disappointed,"We got there around 7pm on a Thursday and the ferries wheel was closed. So I was disappointed because I wanted to ride it. There was an arcade which I was not interested in. Along the pier there were some artists selling their items. Other than that, there wasn't really anything else to do there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JandRlovetotrvl
50,Great place to visit,"The iconic pier is a must see! The fun and excitement on the pier, the swimming, kite flying and beach activities in the Pacific and the shopping and people watching on the promenade--all a great day activity!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelblond
50,"Must see for Route 66, beach, fun and views",End to the historic Route 66. Carnival on the pier as well as some restaurant and shopping/ souvenier stores. Great view of the huge beach. A nice walk for sure.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FerrTravel
30,It was the best California beach. Not now,"If you are visiting L.A, I recommend this place. It's typical American 1950 attractions. But only for one time. Nothing special honestly. Specifically if you are local or you looking for some higher class beach, this is not your beach. Lots of people and not a clean beach. I never go as a local",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amirk973
50,Santa Monica pier,"Nice place to walk around, see ocean views, rides, games, Ferris wheel, places to eat and the third street promenade. Check it out for a night out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G_Raj75
50,Best Sea Food on the Pier!!,"The Santa Monica Pier is a Great place for Family, Fun, and Food!!! They have the Best sea food that you can eat while enjoying the view of the Sea. Very beautiful place for All ages, we'll definitely be back soon!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darlingm77
40,Amusement Park on the Pier,"We drove to the Pier on a Friday night from Hollywood Blvd. We expected the traffic to be bad and to have difficulty parking, but it was the opposite. We paid $20 and parked at a restaurant next to the Pier. The Lot Attendants were friendly and helpful.The Pier is located at the end of Route 66, and admission to the Pier is free. No worries there are tons of little shops, restaurants, booths, games, artists/entertainers, and rides to spend money on. You can also rent fishing equipment at the end of the Pier. Beautiful view of the ocean, beach, and city skyline.We stopped at a booth to have our pictures taken and made into holographic magnets - pretty cool and great souvenirs.I should also note the public washrooms were extremely clean. I was shocked and impressed.Pacific Park is an amusement park located on the Pier. The rides are geared towards children, but still fun. We went on the Ferris wheel. This is a must-do. What a spectacular view!!!To the ladies visiting the Pier - don't wear heels, sport your wedges or flats.Overall, we had fun and would return in the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeep_girl_00

30,An amusement park on a pier,An ordinary amusement park with an attractive location. The attractions can be very good for kids. Had a good fish and chips there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eric060
40,Fun,"The Santa Monica Pier is a fun place to visit. There are rides, shops, street food, buskers and other interesting things to see. The water views are spectacular and the beach is very nice. We also biked under the pier along the pathway and that was very cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Usia2014
40,Carnival Fun,"This is a great place to visit for some old fashioned carnival rides and fun. They have many different rides for young ones as well as adults. You can also play on the beach and in the ocean (although we visited on a chilly day). The rides did not seem to be open at times, but we found that several rides had the same attendant-so if you waited in line somone would come over. You can park right next to the pier for $6.00. We parked up the street for 3.5 hours and it was $5. The only risk is that we were in 3 hour parking and left earlier because of that. The ride attendants did not seem to be too friendly, but if you look past that, it is fun. I would recommend buying the full day passes. It doesn't take too many rides to reach the value. Bring sunscreen!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ralxndr
10,Terrible,"Nothing special, busy and expensive just for a family with kidsIf you are looking for good food forget this place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/561carlyf

40,Great to visit,"We lived Santa Monica and the pier was great....a great Bubba Gump restaurant and rides for the kids, very busy and touristy, but as you would expect.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/franandhow
50,Vibrant and full of life,"We were so close to the pier that we somehow postponed our visit up to our last day in Santa Monica, we went on the evening and it was full of people, so vibrant, we had a wonderful time if it hadn't been for the chilly winds we would have stayed longer",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristianePedreiro
50,Great place,Looks amazing at night can be very busy the beach is amazing a great place to stay and great scenery all day everyday we definitely be back,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/190jpb
30,Pier,Nice place to people watch but a bit scruffy and tacky to be honest and with the fun fair only open Friday Saturday and Sunday a bit disappointing also half the restaurants/attractions were closed and those open apart from pier burger seemed dead and to be honest didn't look that enticing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G_O_C479
40,""" The end of Route 66""",Good for the kids but expensive rides. Still it is worth it for the view from the top of the Ferris wheel.The street performers actually had very good voices and were a nice background sound. There are several eating places which looked good but we ate at Bubba Gump.We visited on a Wednesday but I think the weekends would be very crowded and parking would be a problem.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/884carolinee
20,Not Worth It,Way too many other things to do. This just wasn't worth the walk out to the end. Think cheesy and tacky tourist. The beach is beautiful and sunset is the romantic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ConchyStarfish
20,A great attraction only the restauration needs to be improved,Stock between sauwggy hamburger and a Bubba shrimp restaurant really you will not find the gourmet healty food restaurant in this area Sorry but this is all i can say.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/839michelm
40,Fun,It's fun - but it's no more than a pier. A sea of tourists and plenty of stalls to sell touristy things. It's the end of the Route 66 trail and that's interesting but there didn't seem to be much up-market offerings. But it has to be seen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/QSMPEK
50,Santa Monica pier very cool,"We visited the pier for an afternoon. Had a wonderful fresh seafood lunch at the Albright. The rides were plentiful. The beach was in wonderful condition. It was a great place to take a walk down the beach, have lunch and catch some ice cream.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karlitotheswede
50,Love the beach,"Santa Monica Pier is one of my favorite places to get away and walk on the pier and enjoy the beach. There is lots of people, fun and activities. This is a fun place for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/netdood
40,Kind a cool,I gave it a 4 star because it was free and it has a tremendous amount of history. The pier is 100% a tourist trap. On the upside it doesn't pretend to be anything else. Our family truly enjoyed renting bikes and riding along the bike path if you have time I would recommend that. I believe the one hour bike rental cost us $30 or so for three bikes. It was also cool to check out the end of route 66. I don't think you could spend the whole day here but a few hours is well spent to put it on the I have been here done that list.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E9358FFjustinm
40,Amazing views,Beautiful sunny day. Loved seeing ocean with mountains in the background. Enjoyed people watching and shops.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandy19579

30,Expensive always busy with tourists,I recommend you see the pier. Just be prepared to spend a lot on food and even on pricey pier park games and rides. Dirty pier but good place to say you've visited. Parking is an extra expense I recommend you park near metro expo line route and take the train to the pier. Also lots of homeless hanging around like most LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RalphR950
40,Gorgeous sunset location,Never take a sunset for granted! This pier is full of fun for all. Plenty of parking and seemed safe. Thanks for a wonderful evening!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/568debbieh

50,The Expo Line Will Take You Here. Use It.,"One of Santa Monica's hallmark attractions is the Pier. The ideal place for your day trips is an Expo Line ride away. in time, with the arrival of the Regional Connector it will be a Gold Line ride away. There are a number of places to eat, a massive Ferris wheel and the beach. Plus, there are some occasional street entertainers to keep you company while you shop and look around. This is a recommended attraction for anyone that is planning to visit the great city of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joryans
50,Very busy but worth the visit!!,"I live in CA, but it was my first time to this Pier. Super busy, like, gave me anxiety at first busy. But that went away and the awe if it all took over. It feels like something out of a movie, old and nostalgia-y. There is much to see and do here, plan your time wisely. Definitely a kid friendly place!

40,Buzzing,"Large wharf with lots of shops, restaurants and funfair. There's even an old fashioned carousel so the pier is very busy. A small roller coaster and a few other tame rides make for a nice backdrop and fun place to go with the family. The usual arcades, slots and street entertainers give it a boardwalk type atmosphere. There's a Bubba Gump, where we've eaten before, that's also pretty good. A great beach and well worth a stop on your travels. Recommend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plfara
40,Entertainment,Cool place with lots going on. I went both in the morning and evening so saw both sides of it! Like the quietness in the morning and saw the sun rise over the city.

Lots of people trying to get you to buy their goods, but it's all quite fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/franc933
50,Quintessential California,"The Santa Monica Pier is everything one thinks about when dreaming of LA and California. If visiting the area, it is worth the drive from LA to experience the beach and the pier.It is helpful to read up on the history of the pier prior to arrival as this will enhance one's experience. While walking on the old, oil soaked planks, one gets a better experience of its history with foreknowledge. It is a sturdy beast, which means the storms which destroyed previous iterations were powerful indeed.There is plenty of excellent parking near the beach and it is surprisingly affordable -- about $10 for the day.The pier itself has rides for the family and plenty of fun stops for food. It is for all ages and in our case, the teens particularly enjoyed the experience. It helped the weather was beautiful. It is not inexpensive, though not unreasonable. If traveling on a budget, bring a sack lunch and sit near the pier.The beach close to the pier can be a little crowded, so move down a bit farther. There is more beach here than one can possibly imagine. Showers, restrooms, exercise equipment, bike rentals, and bike paths are readily available.If leaving the pier for the beach, prepare as you would for any beach experience. Bring the sunscreen, towels, and sandals (the sand is scorching hot in summer), and expect a car filled with sand at the end of the day. We wished we had brought some binoculars for the kids to watch the boats far off the coast. However, use caution, don't be creepy and watch beach-goers. There are some creeps scattered among the families.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2theou
40,Iconic pier,A fun place to visit with amusement rides. Great views in a wonderful area overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Lovely beaches by the pier. Santa Monica is one of my favorite places to visit in the U.S. Great for picture taking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulcB6604SH

50,Great experience,Loved my trip out to pier. Plenty to eat and drink. Rides for kids and lots to entertain. Usually has music going as many performers play live music.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eg956
50,Pleasure trip to beach,Gone ghetto. Can't enter the pier without walking through the druggies on the corner. A Group of wanna be hippies feeling each other up openly smoking weed at the entrance. What a shame to make every child walk by this awful scene to try and enjoy the pier. Will never go back unless they clean up their act to be family friendly. Every restaurant had an hour wait and all the walk ups had no seating. Seemed like a waste.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BethM811
50,absolute must,"It's just one of those things you HAVE to do while in LA.It's really crowded, but still a fun adventure/walk. There are some things to do (performers on the pier, rides, swimming on the beach, etc.), a few [priced up] places to eat and a gorgeous view of the ocean.We want on a cloudy day, and it was still beautiful.You don't have to spend a dime there if you don't want to, unless you bring a car, you'll have to pay for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sydnih2017

40,Beautiful spot with lots to do.,We only had a few hours there but it was such a lovely spot. Would have loved to spend a whole day there and maybe stay overnight.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/975belindak
10,Over Crowded,"We visited on a weekend and there were so many people on the pier that half way through the walk, we decided to turn around! There were people everywhere, almost like a scene out of a futuristic horror movie with overpopulated earth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahK-1789
30,"Iconic, but overrun","Jammed with people and tacky commercialism, in what could be a very appealing destination. Nice beach on either side, however. A good family destination, especially compared to Venice beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JrMushroom
50,Honeymoon,"Loved this place, would love to return as two days just wasn't long enough. One of our favourite places on our way along Route 66 right at the end. Highly recommend. Only downside a lot of vagrancy in the area",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rochbarrett
50,One of my favorite places to vacation!,"I love the whole Santa Monica and Venice beach area. The Santa Monica Pier is iconic and my son loves the Pacific Park rides and old fashioned carousel. The roller coaster is pretty cool (not very scary) because once at the top, you have an amazing view of the ocean. There are many places to grab a quick bite to eat, and Bubba Gump's Shrimp Co. is located on the pier as well. We had dinner here and it was delicious. The wait was about an hour and a half, but we killed the time by walking the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reneeh881
50,A must do visit.,Somewhere I have always wanted to visit and it didn't disappoint. Not easy to park close buy without paying an all day parking charge but it's well worth the effort. Views are great and lots to see and do on the pier. End of Route 66 half way along was so cool.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andyw496
50,Vintage California,"Everyone needs to visit the Santa Monica Pier! This is a California landmark and a lot of fun. It is a complete tourist trap, but if you know that going in, you'll have a blast. Just be patient, embrace the beach vibe, and you'll be fine. There is plenty to do, see, and eat. If you buy a wristband for Pacific Park, be sure to ask for potential discounts. (Like Triple A). The midway games are a complete rip off, but also a complete hoot! Try a margarita at Mariasol at the end of the pier, and make sure you walk down behind Mariasol to hang with the local fisherman. The pier is always lined with local musicians, so take some time to listen because many of them are very talented. The day can get expensive, but it's good old California fun and the people watching is worth every penny!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristiHamilton
30,Quick walk,"It is an old peer build out of wood. On the end there is a restaurant. Nothing special. There are a lot of people singing, dancing or showing other talents to get some money",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/569koenv
40,"Great atmosphere, just too many people","Great times made here! Beach, ocean, rides, games, foods, many many sites including people! Get there early for parking.... or late for sunset. The weekday is better for quiet enjoyment of the beach, but weekends are great for many people type atmosphere. Kids absolutely love it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertG768
40,Visited with two teens!,"Lots to do... arcade, rides, restaurants, views!We didn't ride all the rides; they are geared towards younger kids but we did do the Ferris Wheel which provides a great view of the water and of the Pier.We spent time in the arcade, played some air hockey and other a few other games. The games use quarters, and most games were a dollar a game.Not a ton of restaurants on the pier to choose from, as I wanted to sit outside, but it had a couple of nice ones nonetheless.Multiple souvenir shops; multiple people busking.... only thing I wasn't happy with... the people with microphones and speakers preaching about God and all my sins.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/924trinityb
50,"Fun place with lots to see, do and eat.","We went there near sunset for supper. It's a fun place to walk around. Lots of musicians, artist types selling stuff and lots of great places to eat.

30,It's a pier,"We thought that - when in Santa Monica - one had to visit the pier. It was OK, but it is so much like other piers and seaside fairgrounds. Nice to have been on it - not what I would call a ""must see"" attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GerMar60
40,Good for a stroll,"I always enjoy strolling on old wooden piers. This one is an icon of the beach in LA. It has its tacky reataurants, vendors and buskers, and that's what makes it fun. Great views of the coastline, north and south.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tripsteroid
50,Something romantic about this spot,Not sure if because it's a movie iconic spot or just an awesome vibe but it's worth a visit.There are great places to eat and rides for the kids and adults.Check it out!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Davo2012
40,What I expected,"The pier was exactly what I expected, nice an quaint - but very busy. Even though it didn't mean you couldn't get around and there were ample things to see and do from classic amusement rides to different types of food.The different range of people was great for people watching and the view was great in all directions.Be wary of cheap souvenirs a lot of people seemed to get duped by inferior products.If you're a history buff you'll love to see the end of historic Route 66 and what if offers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Warnerdang
50,Spent the ENTIRE DAY Here!,"Santa Monica is one of the highlights of visiting Southern California. The Pier along with Pacific Park make an excellent outing for friends or family. Lots of restaurants, souvenir shops and of course the Pacific Park theme park. If you are in the area, definitely swing by as you will not be disappointed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BGIWorldTraveller
50,Fun little stroll,We took a stroll down the SM Pier during the early afternoon. If was not really too crowded and walking was easy without having to navigate out if everyone's way. Plenty of gift shops and pop ups if you desire a souvenir. We had a delicious ice cream while enjoying people watching from a dining umbrella. Good times.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenA586
40,Santa Monica Pier is a fun way to spend some leisurely time,"The best time to go to the Pier is right before sunset. There are lots of rides and games. Our purpose was to see the ocean, watch the people and catch the sunset. Succeeded on all levels. The Mexican restaurant at the end of the Pier did not have the best service, but we stopped there for cocktails and appetizers (tableside guac which was good), before moving on for dinner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanpG4627SL
50,Summer Fun,"Great summer concerts and lots of booths and family fun. Giveaways, music, food. It was alot of fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoAnnA643
50,Fun night at the pier,Enjoyed a couple of hours on the Pier including great views. Watched the performers and road the fairly tame roller coaster.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4ElizabethC4
50,One-day trip,"Beach area with stunning promenade, pier nice to go there very busy but the experience of the trip, full of craftsmen and good restaurants, not far from the pedestrian has abundant food and a place to do shopping .. In short fun one complete",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yosi_ozan
30,Iconic therefore worth a visit.,"Didn't excite me too much, it is what it is, very overcrowded and full of tourists (me being one). If you are in the area I guess you have to go to tick it off the list but for me it wasn't anything special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/felipehavana
50,First stop on my California trip,Went to the Pier after collecting our convertible from the airport (the only way to see California). Fun to experience somewhere you see on a lot of TV shows and movies.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lj4l
30,A good few hours,"On a recent visit to the area, we attempted to go to the pier on a Saturday night (some of us in the group had been before and others were first-time visitors) and we could not get anywhere near it. The parking lots were all full, street parking was full, beach parking was full. We decided to come back on a week night. We returned on a Tuesday evening and had no issues with parking. Unfortunately, many of the attractions were closed when we arrived (at about 7:00 p.m.) which was surprising, but we still had fun walking around. Primarily because it is such an iconic location and is featured in so many movies/shows. We did enjoy the realization that it was the end of Route 66 and spent some time reading about the history of the pier. We watched some street dancers performing which was cool. All in all, probably worth a visit at least once, but definitely not something I would need to visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelrvo
40,End of the road (RT66),Always a neat place to visit. It's the end of Route 66. How could it not be cool. The pier is always full of action,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gdtrf
50,Wow,"Visited with my sister loved it, hot day wish we had time to swim. Take a hat & suncream, it was very hot day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeanneAl
50,Beaches & drive around area,We were lucky to be with friends in a hire car so we're able to see the lovely beaches & the scenic drives in the area. You can also get there be public transport. Another area worth seen if possible,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dragonsback
40,Fun Time,You can not be in Santa Monica and not walk the pier!Fun place and good access to the beach from it.We had a nice dinner at the end of the pier and it was a good time watching the ocean and people fishing from the pier.Busy and crowded but that is the fun of it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tisim
40,"Lots of colour, noise & fun - esp for kids","You just have to visit the pier if you're in Santa Monica, even just to walk along it. Great place to watch the sunset - but my tip would be to go down to the beach on the south side and then you'll get to see the pier and its colourful lightshows in contrast with the natural sunset colours - fab! Another tip: look for all the colours reflected in the shallow water and the wet sand each time the waves recede - makes for pretty spectacular photos!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pd7
40,Unbelievable numbers of people,"Brief visit to Santa Monica and we visited the Pier a couple of times. Wall to wall people - loud, pushy, with lots of rubbish being touted for sale. Despite that it was strangely interesting watching people - the merry go round inside was interesting as it was reminiscent of those of our youth - my wife had a ride and enjoyed the nostalgia - walked to the end of the pier fighting the mob all the way - bought a cheap hat to keep off the sun (it was also very useful when we got to the UK as a rain hat!) - had a meal at the Mexican restaurant at the far end (avoid the Sangria Rioja - cocktail that was just too fruity and sweet to be enjoyable) -Being the end of Route 66 we took the obligatory photo at the signpost. Overall it was interesting but the lasting memory was of people, people, and more people with heaps of junk for sale, Pretty outlook though when you got to the edges and the old merry go round was very nostalgic",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/290grantn
40,Something for everyone...,"Really loved it. There's beautiful sights, gift shops, live entertainers, food... & if you get there early enough you can even enjoy the mini theme park.Gets a bit cold in the evenings though, so wrap up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whatsdastory

40,Fun afternoon,"Lots to see & do & just as much fun people watching! We had a couple of hours here, lovely to watch the fishermen to seeing people enjoy the rides, watching the street performers, plenty of places to eat & good clean public rest rooms. Iconic place to visit at its the end of Route 66. Definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O6875BHelena
50,An great day out,An iconic location that iffer so much more than just the pier. The adjacent city has a thriving shopping area with a lot of fine eateries and high end shops.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marty045
40,must see,"You just visit here if you are in Los Angeles whether it is on the beach or the pier both are great, Recommend going on the Ferris wheel as the views are great and it is only $8 each. Plenty of restaurants and bars nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paddy10014
10,Walk as fast as you can,"I didn't enjoy the pier, and mostly because it is designed specifically for tourists. Even if you want to go to the beach next to the pier, I suggest a short walk/ride down to Venice Beach which is much less crowded.It reminded me of Coney Island or an old amusement park.Kids may enjoy it, and there are plenty of tourist-trap restaurants, if you're into that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hasheats
50,A must see!,"The pier was crowded but I was glad we stopped by. We spent four hours here just walking around and doing some shopping, eating and taking in the sights. Interesting people on the pier. A diverse mix of all cultures. Had a fabulous time. If you are in the area, it's a must see. The pictures of the ocean are just beautiful and we caught the sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smiley0987

50,Must See LA Sight,Yes you've seen it in movies and it is worth the visit. Parking can be fun but we parked in a meter park near the muscle beach area which was easy. Make sure you get a picture under the route 66 sign a third of the way along bridge. Will take approx 1 hr out of car.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Desmovalve
40,Santa Monica Pier,The pier is a great place to visit when in the LA area. Good food and refreshments are available. Route 66 memorabilia is sold here also. Be sure to take a selfie with the Rt.66 sign!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O1331CVkareng
50,Nice place to stretch your legs,Enjoyed walking the pier on a Beautiful Day! Great views to take pictures and enjoyed the shops. A nice thing to do when in Santa Monica.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stinky60
50,Perfect day for a visit to the Pier,"Started the day by walking from Venice Beach to the Santa Monica Pier. Venice Beach seemed dirty and a little risky (unsafe) compared to the beach and pier at Santa Monica. A lot of street vendors, shops and rides on the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffR200
50,A must see in Santa Monica.,Day or night this is an attraction that can be enjoyed by every member of the family. Just be aware that the restaurants on the pier close at 20.30 at this time of the year.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkW6213

40,Must see,This is a must see at least once for anyone in the area. Always busy but well worth the time and effort.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prenticew2014

40,fun to see but very busy,Second time to go here and went on a Sunday in early October. Very busy!! Walked over from 3rd street promenade and only one sidewalk down onto pier over highway just jammed with people. They should stop vehicle on Colorado and turn into a larger pedestrian friendly access. The pier has some rides and gift shops and a restaurant at end but nothing too exciting. Worth a first visit but not to return.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vanfull

50,Old Fashioned - but still a great visit!,"Have visited about 10 times over the last 25 years - it doesn't change much - but the sun always shines and the people are always happy ! Had a Mexican Restaurant breakfast once, but I didn't get it at the time - being used to a full English - guess that was my fault. Venice beach is great, just a few yards away with plenty of unique attractions and a nice little shopping mall, as well as market type stalls.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/953jim
50,Just like the movies,"A friend showed me around Santa Monica when I was visiting Cali and took me here. I've seen so many shots of it on Instagram and in films and it was so exciting to actually be there. Save yourself some room to sample some of the typical American vender food, churros, hotdogs, tacos and my favourite- funnel cake (what I can only describe as a huge round pile of piped squiggly doughnut) definitely share one they're probably big enough for 3 ! Oh and obviously go on the rides before you eat... a must see for your la trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeidiC1532
50,Beach play,"Beautiful board beach. Kids enjoyed a play with make shift sand toys. We saved some plastic cups from lunch but there are vendors selling toys and food, walking along the beach. Beach was cleaner than expected, with life guard on duty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinawK2425AJ
50,Beautiful Pier,The place is full of people having a great time. End of Route 66 is there and is a must for a photo. Shops are great and it is a beautiful traditional pier. A must visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IanCardwell262
50,Feel Good,"Without a doubt my favourite place in LA, if not possibly the world. I cant describe what it is about Santa Monica pier but just has such a feel good factor. Its so lively always buzzing with people but if you go down the end of the pier you can still find a quiet spot. Absolutely love it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrissyD85
40,Walk on the pier,"Go on a weekday!It might not be as crowded but everything is still open and you can find a good spot to sit, relax, have an ice cream cone and enjoy the beautiful weather.Or go on a Thursday after work and catch a twilight concert in the summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YasmineZikry

30,Good to see,We caught the train from USC. It was an easy train ride and walked down to the pier. Quite a few homeless people around. We hired bikes and cruised down to Venice beach which was an easy ride.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eiles4
20,Dont go out of your way,Very touristy but if you're there check it out. Ocean views are nice. Prefer almost every other beach area and pier in LA. Promenade is like an outside middle America mall. Disappointing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterkV9524CG
20,Lame unless you're a kid,"I've heard so many cool things about the Santa Monica Pier, when in reality it is similar to the fair. There are rides, games, an over-priced drinks. Bad idea if it's hot outside because there are so many people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miapapageorge
50,This is LA!,"I ended up going to the pier the other day to go PokemonGo Hunting! I forgot how nostalgic the pier was! From the giant light up Ferris wheel to the roller coaster they have on the pier, nothing is more iconic to Los Angeles than the Santa Monica Pier! The pier was built in 1909 and was the first concrete pier in the West Coast! The concrete pier is all gone and made way to what we have today! Reopened in 1996, the pier has an aquarium, historic merry go round and hosts outdoor summer concerts, fishing and sit down restaurant at the end of the pier! Definitely a place to enjoy the Southern California sunsets and enjoy the warm SoCal nights!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theJasonTadeoShow

40,Must see,"Even though it was very busy, it was still fun. The wait for dining is long but we walked around and shopped the vendors while we waited. Look for vendors on the beach making handmade items.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/529sandyd

40,People watching galore,"The SM Pier has a boardwalk feel with various types of restaurants, a ferris wheel, and game arcades. It can be very crowded with everyone from out of town tourists, locals out for a walk, and street performers. It's a very festive atmosphere. Parking can be difficult, but I found that you can actually park on the pier behind some of the restaurants for a reasonable charge. Nice time to come is during the late afternoons and watch the sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Oski85
50,Always Busy!,"There is always something going on at Santa Monica Pier...yesterday it was Japan/America Kite Festival, with kites of all sizes and shapes flying high!

40,"LOVELY FOR COUPLES, FAMILIES- JUST TO STROLL ALONG AND TAKE IT ALL IN!","This is a great place just to experience the street vendors and musicians on a sunny day! It's a great place for children too, with lots for them to do on the rides. There are many actors along the pier and very good musicians at times. Enjoy the stroll and for somewhere quieter, just walk along the beach and ENJOY!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Christy_Luv2
30,"Really cool place, grab yourself a beer and enjoy the view",Great view of the ocean of course. Lots to see and do as the area is generally really vibrant. Great place to kick back and chill in the sun,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/12robk
30,Left a little disappointed!,"After hearing all about the great Pier and how iconic it was, I was left a little disappointed :( definitely need to go there but don't have your hopes up!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cassiew656

40,Great place for kids!,"Parked a few blocks away and walked down to pier. There is pier parking but was full when we went. Plenty of great restaurants and shops to visit on the walk over. Entering the pier had several street performers and people selling various things. Walk through that mess quickly! On the pier, kids had a great time at arcade and playing the carnival type games. Roller coaster and ferris wheel very cool also being right on the water. Didn't have a chance to go on the beach. Cool spot to spend an afternoon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dchang1978

30,Very interesting street performers at night!!,"Various food options, a few carnival rides and a roller coaster. Several street vendors and performers were there when we visited at night. Lots of people fishing. It was just something to see if you've never been there!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cdin10ac
40,Must see when in Santa Monica,Can't really give this a miss. It marks the end of Route 66 and offers a great view toward Malibu and Venice Beach. You can actually drive onto the pier and park but I would strongly suggest otherwise as the parking chaos is best seen by foot. Especially on weekends. There is a Bubba Gump and some other restaurants as well as fast food and sweets. Not to mention the roller coaster ride which is well worth the few bucks. Not for the thrill but for the view. Walk all the way to the end to enjoy the scenery and look out onto the mighty Pacific Ocean. Rest assured you won't feel lonely on the pier...Still worth a visit though despite the maddening number of people on there on a Saturday night.Have fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stefans03
40,Must visit if you're in LA,"Loved the area of Santa Monica, if I ever get back to California, I would love to stay there. You have to go to the Santa Monica Pier if you're in the LA area. It's as expected - big, crowded with a lot going on. Good for kids as there is a mini amusement park. The beach is wide with plenty of space for everyone. If you're from the East coast, think Jones Beach or Coney Island. There are a lot of nice restaurants in the area, in addition to the regular fast food places. There is a train which takes you right to the pier as well as public buses. The 3rd St Promenade has shops and restaurants as well and is within walking distance of the beach/pier. Venice Beach is maybe @20-30 minutes away and you can rent bikes to ride there. If you're driving I recommend taking a drive up the Pacific Coast Highway to Malibu, which is @30-40 minutes north without traffic. A nice scenic ride and worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/952gayleh
40,Cool,"This was my favourite part of LA. My girlfriend used to live in la and used to hang out on the pier. There is a great atmosphere here with some rides to enjoy, some places to eat and also a lovely beach and the view of the ocean is unreal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davideG6065HC
40,Great people watching,Our teenage son wanted to see the pier during his first visit to LA and we all enjoyed it. The crowd was in full force on Saturday afternoon and the numerous performers put on a great show. There was a very playful seal swimming around the end of the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/459anthonyl
40,Iconic L.A. Pier,"We went to this famous pier on the July 4th long weekend and it was like a zoo. Much too crowded to walk and could not avoid always bumping into others on the pier. It is a must see if you are a tourist since this old pier has a great reputation as a must see location . This is an iconic pier and is used as backdrop in many a Hollywood movies and the beach scene and nearby boardwalk is a true Southern California experience. For next time, however, we'll choose an off season day to avoid the crowds and the impossible parking and enjoy a more relaxing experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MandC0218
50,Nice place,"Eating a ice cream, seagull flew down took it funny story to tell I guess, nice views relaxing beer end of pier",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ross4020
30,Nice view but touristy,"This pier is a well known LA icon that most tourists will try to visit. Very crowded with lots of shops and restaurants nearby. Best to park in the multi storey car park a block away, free for the first two hours.Going onto the pier itself is for the brave on a weekend. Jam packed with visitors. The usual souvenir shops and restaurants are situated on the pier.I cannot say that it is recommended.The near by Venice Beach might be more relaxing to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kwoksrus
40,Visit if you are around,"Legendary pier but nothing super and way smaller than compared to San Francisco pier 39. We did not try rollercoaster or any other ride and went during sunset, views were nice that time. Only few places to eat on a pier but visit the boulevard nearby which offers lots of shops and places to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stiimi
40,"Fun, but ..","We were lucky enough to be staying close to Santa Monica Pier so went for a wander quite often. We were disappointed that the rides shut down so early, and the shops were closing even though there were lots and lots of people looking around. Some shops and food outlets weren't open at all. Perhaps its something to do with regulations??",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kiwihappydragonlady
40,Fun. Must do the end of Route 66.,"We had a great time visiting the pier at the end of our Desert Trip vacation. There were people shark fishing, musicians on the pier and a great carousel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/terrycQ698AM
40,A Must Stop,"Love Santa Monica Pier. No matter how many times Ive gone its just perfect in the mornings, less people, vendors just opening up. If you walk all the way to the end and find a comfy spot on a bench (right past the last restaurant) you'll see early morning fishermen and just watch the water roll in and out. Perfect for romance, R&R or just some quiet time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nikimari1
50,Great Adventure,It was a worth drive from L.A Covina to here with perfect weather as we don't have much when we left in Alberta Canada .If you want to relax in the area there are a lots to do with parking on the side as well .Shops and restaurant can be found in the area as well.Great scenery too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/277ericd
40,Crowded on a warm Saturday,"The pier was absolutely packed on a very warm Saturday afternoon. We wanted to see the end of Route 66 sign, otherwise I would probably just have paddled in the Pacific.It was a great opportunity for people watching and the ice creams were great",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grannye
50,Fun People Watching,Although there were a lot of interesting characters - I think my favourite was Rock n Roll Jesus at the very end of the pier. Couldn't visit Santa Monica without a least a quick walk on the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2013Wren
50,Worth every penny!,My family and I recently visited this beach and had a great time. We ate at Bubba Gumps and had the best food. There is so much to see or do here and the shopping is reasonable for tourist gear. We will definitely be back!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HiD1972
40,Lots to see and do,Loved it here. The pier had so much going on you could easily spend a full day here with restaurants and rides etc.The views were amazing from the top of the pier too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kikadez
50,"Fun, but expensive.","We rode the ferries wheel and that was fun! $32 for the 4 of us seemed steep. If I wasn't so tired, I probably would have bought a day pass and gone on the roller coaster too! We had a nice walk on the pier and the weather was great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AZCityGirl

40,A must see,"The Santa Monica Pier is a historical landmark. It's a bit standard as far as touristy piers go, but the ferris wheel is fun and it was interesting watching the trapeze school for a bit. It's a nice distraction after some time on the beach. It can get crowded but early in the morning it's not too bad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hennaeel
40,Night view and leisure walk after dinner,"Its great for a walk after dinner and to see this part of the place in the evening ..Thou I went late, this place still has crowds and there are people fishing..Nice calm sea and the moonlight reflect on the water is so scenic..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mukira84
40,Great Ferris Wheel!,"The Ferris Wheel ride was so fun and gave us a great view of all of the lights of the city and boats on the ocean. They let our group of 3 have our own ""tub"" which was more comfortable than if crowed with 8 people. Can't wait to ride the Ferris Wheel in the daytime to get a different perspective. Also, on the pier, my 3 sons won a pink bear in a basketball goal game which was special and made me laugh at how they are still as competitive now, as young adults, as when they were teenagers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karencL2829OC
50,Awesome,"Great visit, nice entertainment and nice Sunset. Must see if you are in the area! Also walking into town for some drinks/shopping is recommended",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/corn_v75
40,A must visit when in Santa Monica,"Visiting the Pier on a weekend in October, we were treated to a peaceful visit. We even had a chance for a photo op with the Highway 66 sign WITHOUT waiting in line for an hour. :) The pier is lined with shops and activities as well as eateries and tourist info stations. We enjoyed walking along this famed pier and taking in the sights both on the pier and around it. A fun place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jufrafay
50,We brought the rain,"First time coming to this place after going to universal studios too. It was raining during that time so I wasn't able to enjoy the place since it was still cold for me during that time. But even if its raining, I believe it would be very nice there to chill with family and friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mabskii
40,Good attraction,Pier has good rides and views of city. We spent good time at beach right next and had food and rides at pier. It has large parking with easy access to beach and pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T_Shahid

30,Beach front stroll,"Have to say I was disappointed in Santa Monica pier, all the hype about it and I was more impressed with the piers in blackpool, didn't eat or drink on the pier, not sure if my expectations were high because of what I had read about it, maybe you have to walk down it just to say you have done it, but it would not be at the top of my recommendation list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tjmusic
50,Cool place with lots happening,"Great spot to head with the family, lots to see and do and Venice beach is just a 30min walk away.Pier was nice and clean and had lots to see and do, the carnival was fun and all the street artists were great to watch.If you get the chance sit at Bubba Gumps, have dinner and watch the sunset over the pier it's fantastic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnbL6297NJ
40,Wow! A pier that you can drive onto (and park!),"My wife and I visited the pier on a couple of occasions over the last few days while staying in Santa Monica.Firstly, it is wooden and cars still drive onto it to park! Amazing sound (thumpity thump!) can be heard when the cars roll onto the pier! Must be like being back in the 60's!Then you have all the attractions - the people, performers, fairground rides, food (Japadog!), drinks, Route 66 finale, the fisherman and the ocean and wildlife itself! I spotted a small shark one day, then a Sealion the next!It is th emost beautiful place to sit in the sun with a nice cool breeze on your face and just watch the world go by.Come and enjoy the experience, it doesn't cost a dime!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PathManSlough

40,Fun people watching,"We had a fun day walking along the pier and people watching, and catching Pokemon (there were tons). There are tons of people out on the pier and the restaurants are pretty busy (but not hard to get in).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SherriLR
40,Great view on LA,It's worth while to take the walk to the end of the pier. It offers amazing possibilities for pictures of the coastline.It would be nice if it would be kept a bit cleaner ...which I understand is difficult considering the homelessness situation there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GWHAM
40,September visit,"Stayed in Santa Monica for 4 nights & had to experience the Pier, was so many different things going on, street performers etc lots of different people, was an enjoyable time : )",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/225kelliej
10,THIEVES!! STOP!!!,"After what was a pretty amazing trip to California we had decided to waste some time before heading to the airport at the Santa Monica Pier. We parked in the paid lot right beside the pier alongside Bubba Gump Shrimp where the 'lot attendant' put a pink paper on our dashboard. My husband and I walked to the end of the pier, and rode the Ferris wheel, which totalled about 45 minutes.When we returned to our car it looked normal, until I noticed our backpack was missing, we then popped the trunk and found that everything was missing. At first we thought we someone opened the wrong car, this couldn't have happened. Wrong! In broad daylight, in a paid parking lot with hundreds of people around someone had broken into our car and robbed us. We were left with the clothing on our backs and luckily our licenses and credit cards. Our passports, luggage, camera, everything we brought with us, along with the souvenirs I had bought my family from Disneyland were all gone.I stayed with the car while my husband went and grabbed security who told us to just go to the police station. He had a paper, and number to call right away, like this was a common occurrence. In hindsight, that seems a little odd, why wouldn't we call the police to the pier? Didn't they want to see if there were any witnesses? Do they not want people to know what's going on there? That pink thing on our dashboard, did it mark our car?Anyway, we followed instructions and went to the police station, where they did forensics and unfortunately, we weren't the only victims at the pier that day. They explained that the thieves had jammed something in the door lock and that's how they got access. We were told it's an epidemic in Southern California and basically shown that we were just another number, and chances are we wouldn't see any of our things again.It was one of the worst experiences that I've had while travelling, it happened at 2:00 pm on a Monday afternoon. Luckily 3 days later and after applying for emergency passports, we could finally return hope with absolutely nothing from our trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NikitaGrai86
40,"Great location, love the seafood","I went and visited LA, we happen to visit the Santa Monica Pier. We had a great time, getting to enjoy the view and visit the different shops. We wanted to eat close by and choose this place.We were greeted very good, and seated as requested which was a view to the beach.Everyone was nice and we order the food, taking a normal time to receive it. The view was great of the beach and it was a great day.Everyone on my family loved the food, I wanted a Shrimp po boy and it was awesome. I asked for a local beer and received a complementary beer mug.Overall we like the place, and would recommend. They had free wi fi, bathrooms were clean. Great place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdwardBa70
50,Buzzing,Had a good day out on the pier where we found the end of the route 66 sign and shops and restaurants. Highlight was the leopard seals swimming at the end of the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamdE2876JZ
40,Last stop of road 66,Nice place to stay a Sunday afternoon en enjoy the view and the beach.Didn't try any of the restaurant there,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/98laurente
50,NICE,You can enjoy the pier day or night ! Just fun to walk and see people from all over. Had fun playing and getting on the fair type rides. Great view of the ocean and the beach!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolimat
50,Must see in Santa Monica,The pier is huge and you have to check it out while you're here. There are several restaurants. You can ride a roller coaster or feeris wheel! I think $12 gets you an unlimited ride pass for kids under 7. It's a sight to see. And the beach and mountains are beautiful too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/804chadr
40,Great spot for fun,Lots of fun. My mom and I rode the roller coaster. A great tourist area. Park in the garage across the street and the first 90 minutes are free after that it's only 1.25 an hour. Beware of people on drugs and people asking for money (this is allllllll of LA thought) overall a fun little stop with some great photo opportunities.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/616jaclync
30,Touristy and busy,"The pier itself is a interesting site but it was busy and many people were hanging around catching Pokemon whilst we were there. The rides were lit up at night which was spectacular but the local and tourists jam the pier for all of the restaurants, stores and rides. It has sign stating it is the last stop of Route 66.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Drakson90
50,Santa Monica pier,Great area to take the family. Go there in the morning before the crowds to avoid a long wait for the rides. 🎡 Ferris wheel offers and excellent view of Santa Monica beach. Park is clean. Beach and water very clean. Mornings offer surf lessons.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/candiceg725
50,End òf Route 66,Satan Monica pier is the end of Route 66. It even has a sign stating this. Parking is free and right beside the pier. Pier is a must see after seeing it in so many movies. Lots of little shops and souvenir shops. A few restaurants as well. Make sure you eat at bubba gumps. Food and service is awesome. Take a ride on the Ferris wheel and roller coaster. Then walk down to the beach and dip your feet in the ocean,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/872gabrielleb

40,A great CA shore experience,"I love that there is so much to see and do on Santa Monica pier, unlike most beach city piers! From people watching to riding the Ferris wheel! Anyone of all ages will have a good time. Dog friendly too! Great history behind the pier too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joyw173
40,"Busy pier, amazing sunsets","Easy access, very busy. Fairground and restaurants galore.light shows on the ferris wheel give brilliant backdrops in the evening. The access ramp gets busy at sunset, with everyone trying for the perfect sunset photo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeV2090
40,Lots going on,"Enjoyed the pier, good souvenirs on offer, little funfair park, can fish off of the pier also! There is a bait shop too and restaurants! Entertainment and some questionable entertainment also! But all round a good pier!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VixandPete
40,It's cute,This is one of the ‘must do’ list. Standing at the end of Route 66 is pretty cool. The pier is definitely worth a walk along but I’d choose your time quite carefully as it can get really busy. I walked all the way to the end to listen to a busker with a beautiful voice and watch the fishermen. Lovely time spent there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SwissSooosi
40,This Is The End Of The Road,"Probably the best known highway in all of America is U.S. Route 66; also known as the ""Will Rogers Highway"" or the ""Main Street of America"". One of the older portions of the U.S. Highway System, US Route 66 was established on November 11, 1926. Originally starting from Chicago, Route 66 headed West before ending at the Santa Monica Pier.From it's original purpose of bringing sewer pipes out to the ocean, the structure has evolved into one of the most visited ""Amusement Piers"" still left in the US. It has also been the background for around 30 movies, 60 TV shows and 25 music videos.A leisurely stroll out onto the pier is a great experience. There are full service restaurants, bars, fast food and wandering vendors. Souvenir shops abound as well as a number of Santa Monica oriented craft kiosks. That arcade has over 200 games to spend your money on and you can ride on the only solar-powered Ferris wheel in the area. And then there is the Looff Hippodrome Carousel; built in 1916.From the pier there are beautiful views of the ocean and the beach. If you have the time, go swimming with the hundreds of other people enjoying the waves and the sun. My only caution is to stay hydrated and use a high quality sun screen. The sun can be very harsh when you are on the pier.This is a pleasant way to spend a family day so don't miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MartinT170
40,iconic,"I would have the say that this is one of the most iconic piers in the world!It's big, has shopping, dinning, and rides! It's a must see when in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Derrick_Ross
50,Swarming with people and Pokémon,"I really enjoyed walking down Santa Monica pier. There are plenty of interesting things to look at, a great view of the beach and the ocean, and it's a great place to watch the sunset. Not to mention 14 Pokéstops - nearly all of them with lures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U6093NYdanb
40,Iconic,Love Santa Monica Pier! It's nowhere near as big as I thought it would be - the atmosphere and location makes up for it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kater946
40,Fun way to spend an evening in LA,Nice way to spend an evening walking around the Pier and the Third Street Promenade. Great people watching and lots of good restaurants and shopping.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MAM716
40,Ending Route 66 trip,"This is a fun stop to make. Parking on the pier is $3 hr or park across the street for cheaper rate. The are venders, artists, musicians, people fishing, arcade, restaurants and Pacific Park. We rode the Ferris wheel to take in the views for $8 a piece. Lots of photo ops plus you can go to the beach. It's fun and it's a tourist trap but well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/982marissab
30,An odd experience,"This is a great place, looks beautiful from afar. However once you venture down closer to the pier you begin to discover the real thing. Very dirty, there were people fighting and it was so sad to see so many people looking through the bins for food. Not a lot going on either, but has potential to be good!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adamjon1
40,Good place to spend an evening,It's a good place to spend an evening of you are near to Santa Monica. The lights and friendly traders are really good and the fresh air from the beach is also refreshing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eldhose
40,Nice afternoon out,This makes a nice way to spend an afternoon. Good parking available below the pier. Plenty of food options on the pier as well as inland. It's a little piece of old fashioned history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Davos8n8
40,"Cool area, and a fun stop for a few hours","Between restaurants, activities and the view - a fun stop for a few hours. You will empty your wallet on the rides (don't miss the ferris wheel - breathtaking view of both land and sea); good seafood options (though not cheap).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kirstinb587
40,Average pier,We had to do the pier as that's where the Route 66 finishes. The pier is quite like any other pier but we did have some excellent seafood in the restaurant which was no that expensive. We had fun watching the fishermen but the steep slope back up to the road was a killer on the legs. Worth a visit if only to say you've been.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/980annettes
30,Nice Boardwalk Kiddie Rides,Dont expect thrillpark excitement at this boardwalk although it is fun. There is great people watching with the ocean waves right there crashing on the pier posts. The food was really good here but a little expensive. They also have carnival style games which were alot of fun but again a little expensive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/499BarbaraH
30,Parking expensive and dodgy clientele,"We visited and enjoyed it as a land mark ... Parking was $15 so if you're pippin for a quick look , find somewhere else to park.Some girl had her bag robbed at knife point so be careful !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tri3
30,It's nice but cluttered,"When in Santa Monica, this is one things you must do.We loved the view of the ocean during sunset time.Maybe there were too many people for my taste, but I liked the experience anyways.Bring a jacket if weather is fresh because the wind over there is quite strong.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NannetteP
30,Typical touristy stuff,"You can go on some sketchy looking rides (if you dare), get your name drawn on a piece of sand, and go to Bubba Gump Shrimp Co if that's your thing. We just took a leisurely walk to the end, looked at the Pacific...then walked back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/551jena
50,Iconic Santa Monica Pier,"The Iconic Santa Monica Pier did not disappoint day or night. There is plenty of tourists shops, buskers and food to entertain all. We sat on the bench and watched the Fisherman, strolled the carnival and photographed the Legendary Merry Go RoundSanta Monica Pier is a place to visit day and night. The ambience changes with the different times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HonoluluKat
50,Great Time at the Pier!,We went to the Santa Monica Pier! We had a great time! A lot of interesting people! It was so interesting to meet up with different cultures!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cndysue901
40,Must do if you are in L.A.,"Came down in the afternoon and the Santa Monica pier was well worth exploring, both on it and under it. Great people watching, a small fun fair and some novelty shops but the main thing for us was being near the water.If you like photography then this is a great place for sunsets. Get your spot early though as there were about 20 of us all under the pier getting the seating sun through the pylons of the pier (was still worth it, got some great photos)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alistairt954
40,Tourist trap,Well you just have to go!A real eclectic mix of people. I could happily give it a miss but when in Santa Monica you have to have a look at the wheel and fitness fanatics. Plus side we saw some seals off the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sul720
30,It's a must-see part of any trip to Santa Monica,"Honky-Tonk on the water. Delivers the experience you expect. Happy crowds strolling a packed pier with neon lights, carnival rides and the usual boardwalk fare. It's a short walk down and back; you'll enjoy it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeamRoadKill
50,Quirky piece of coastal nostalgia,"The pier is a great place to find a little entertainment, shop and get a bite to eat. There is something for everyone here. Take a walk under the pier to discover the hidden boat. Be sure to stick around for the sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrsnlopez
50,Fun filled area with great shopping,"I would recommend allocating at least half a day here, starting from Santa Monica pier. Shop at the various gift shops along the pier, play modern arcade games and old school carnival games, walk along the vast beaches, and try some churros along the pier.After which, head to the shopping area nearby with Nordstrom and plenty of chain stores around. Found a games shop with cool puzzles and games! There's also couple of good bars and restaurants in the area.Also this is the best area in LA to catch a lot of Pokémons if you play it as the lures are perpetually active.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wanderingoffagain
50,Great place to visit,Loved the view and had a great time here. Parking was fair and lots to do. Worth the visit to the end of Route 66.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevenR239
50,"People, food and fun !",This is definitely a must see if you are in LA - beautiful beach and fabulous Pier.Lots of street entertainment on walking to the pier and we were there at dusk on a Friday. We had a Pier burger and homemade lemonade which was tasty and for two of us it was about $20.Magic sunset and plenty of activities to do but mostly great photos to take home or post on Facebook !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/margotm27
40,Felt a bit gritty,"My family walked over from a nearby hotel for the afternoon. The pier has a certain shady element that exists. There are also tons of homeless that frequent the place. It is just something that one needs to be aware of. I would go back, but one needs to be very aware of their surroundings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tshissler
40,Popular pier attracts crowds ... so come early and leave quickly,"Featured in many movies, this place certainly attracts the crowds. But it is really a place that is worth a quick look, and move on. In the summer and on weekends, this place can become quite oppressive with everybody jostling with each other for room. And parking in the area is very expensive as The Peoples Republic of Santa Monica becomes more and more anti-vehicle. My recommendation is to visit this place at 8 am and move on quickly. You can say that you have been there but beyond that does not amount to much. It is not a particularly beautiful pier, just a busy one with a history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vincemc
30,Crowds,"Ok to visit, but not a must see. Lots of ""street"" performers, homeless sleeping on beach. Cleaner than Venice though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/971danat
40,Very cool little spot,We had a very nice time down at the pier. It was a lovely warm afternoon for a stroll down to the ferries wheel and got our selfs a shake all in all it was a very cool place to spend the arvo. But it was a Monday afternoon and it was still busy so if you are thinking of going on a weekend it will be packed. So maybe plan your trip down there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gilkesy
50,Great View from the Ferris Wheel,Lovely old fashioned pier with lots to see and doThe view from the top of the Ferris Wheel is brilliant - and it is not very expensive at all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/723sallys
40,Classic Pier that is well worth the visit,"Santa Monica Pier is one of the classic piers found along the Western Coast of the USA and one of the key attractions of Los Angeles. Whilst it is a bit of a tourist trap, it is still a fun visit and it brings a sense of nostalgia with regards to what the piers must have been like at the peak of the 1920s. Two of my children (aged 6 and 8) loved riding the Merry-go-round which can be found in an original rotunda at the end of the pier. Well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Darren_C_Thomas
30,Nothing much,"Went here for an evening stroll. There were some restaurants and a small amusement center. Walked to the mall which was also nothing much. A lot of Pokemon can be captured here though, if you are into that. If you have other plans, you can skip this one. I can imagine it would have been a lot better in the afternoon though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rgp117
30,One to tick of the list!,It's a tourist trap-tacky stalls / over priced restuarantsIt is a great place to see the sunsetBut santa monica is full of amazing places,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dexter41
40,Loved it,"If you want to feel young again make sure to stop by and spend some time here. A few old rides, decent food and a great view. Also, Malibu up the road a few miles. Beach is enormous",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelcJ4555ET
30,Touristy but still a must if in Santa Monica/L.A.,Touristy but still a must if in Santa Monica/L.A. A lot of tourists even though it was a cloudy day with a heavy marine layer when I went ... but it would be cool if you brought kids because of all the cool rides and attractions there!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/METRUN360
30,Showing it's age,The buildings/facilities are showing signs of wear and tear. The place could use a little cleaning and sprucing up. Great people watching.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A_Michigan_Traveler
50,alive part,"we loved santa monica pier, after lay down under the sun there are many food places to eat or drink at pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/191semiha
40,Must See for Families,"Definitely a must do if in the area, it is super filmed location, so it is cool to walk through it in person. It is a great way to spend hours with the family with the rides, arcade and aquarium.Best part that we enjoyed about the Pier was seeing it from Venice beach at night, it is all lit up and a great light show to watch at night!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traciontheriver
40,Predictable but a great atmosphere,Had a great evening here and watched the sunset. The pier is quite kitch but you know that before you go. The theme park is very brightly lit. We went to dinner after a walk on the pier and had a great time afterwards with a night swim in the surf.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eggo1969
50,One of the best places for tourist,"I love Santa Monica Pier. It's beautiful and clean. It's very busy but has shops, restaurants and of course a gorgeous beach. As with any busy city or beach there are vagrants but not bad considering other beaches in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tr84vv
40,Loved Santa Monica!,This is a great diversion from shopping and worth a look. A bit of family fun as the sun goes down while you wait for your reservation at The Lobster.Do wear flat shoes and take a wrap - even in summer it gets cold and the wooden floor is very uneven with lots of rivets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Babycakes2014
50,One to tick off my bucket list,"We visited here as part of our honeymoon roadtrip - we had an LA Go Card, where the all day unlimited pass was included. We only used it for a couple of rides (big wheel and rollercoaster), but it was great fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/201stephaniei
50,Pier is great!,"Restaurants on pier are good, views are good, sea life watching is good. We ate breakfast at Bubba gumps, it was good good, good value and super friendly service.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathleenPR
40,Iconic LA,A must do part of any trip to LA. Easy to get to I recommend parking in the beach car park $12 fixed price.Plenty of entertainment on the pier and a great place to watch the sun go down.Every time I go there there are people fishing but I have never seen anyone catch a fish!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonycX625IZ
40,Favourite waste of time!,"A pleasant way to spend a fall afternoon and watch the sun set over the ocean. Lots of people but everyone was ""well behaved"" and just having fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GW885
40,Good spot,If it's clean beaches with a pier for food and attractions then this is the place to go. Also some decent eateries,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/818liamk
50,Top place,"Fantastic atmosphere, only a breif visit however very enjoyable, kids loved it, has a little bit of everything for all of us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheTons
40,Iconic spot with a seal visit,Takes a bit of time to get there but it's a beautiful place. I don't get the impression too any locals visit but the attractions are good. We were even fortunate enough to have a seal swim along side us at the pier!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/477JamesD477
20,Worst part of my trip... :/,The parking was terrible! Period! They block 90% of it off for residents past 6pm. You then have to pay $20 even at night. Once we up on the pier it was good to walk around and check it out. The crowd was ok at night and was pretty. I would not come back myself and waste my time for the cost of the area. Good for once in a lifetime or to bring the kids once.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SHAWNROY1
50,Coolest beach!,"Great place to spend time with your friends and family! Nice place to swim, eat, do sport, etc. Very clean, especially in the comparison with the next beach, the Venetian.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kubra_Karimova
40,Santa monica pier,A fun place. Many buskers and street performers and most were actually very good. A few little rides and games around mostly for kids. We arrived late afternoon into sunset and stayed for dinner. Its got a laid back atmosphere. Many people were fishing off the pier. After walking the pier we walked down to the beach. The promenade with shops and restaurants is close by the top of the street and was good to add onto the visit. Worth a trip its good for all ages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missmonique
50,Perfect place to hang out,You can spend a whole day at pier. We had lunch in buba gamp. Ny kids like the rides. The small shop was lovely. We ate our ice cream near the beach and watched the sun rise.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maya869
50,Beautiful,"Amazing views of the beach & lots of different things to do & see on the pier. It was very busy time of the year, so lots of people & very busy. Great day out. Loved walking around the pier. Great place for families & kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roving50461
50,A Pier with a Fair,"It totally felt like I was at a Fair. The Pier itself if hustling with life. There are restaurants, cafe's and you can fish if you'd like. If you like to people watch this is the place, get yourself a high vantage point and look away. So far on all my visits this place has always been crowded. Maybe on a Monday you can find it to be less crowded but not always. It is an awesome destination if you are playing hookie from work. You can get here by car, which will take you about an hour +. Or you can take the Metro transit system, the 704, the 4 or the Metro Exposition line which will drop you off like 3 blocks from the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hectorh865
40,Gotta visit at least once,I personally went there because I was doing route 66 and the end is in the pier. However when there we go to eat usually at Bubba Gum( cant go wrong ) but I mean the pier itself is amazing where else can you find such a pier!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alvaromg1993
40,A must see sight but should open later!!,"We loved spending our evenings on the pier when in Santa Monica - there are always street entertainers around, the sunsets are beautiful over the ocean and the restaurants are good. However, everything closes so early!! We were hoping to grab some churros or an ice cream but everything shut around 5ish every night (it may have been out of season but there were tonnes of people about) - same for the rides too. It was a day time only activity really...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ab2710
50,LOTS OF THINGS TO LOOK AT & SEE!!!!!,"There is so much going on at this Pier live music of all kinds something for every one people being funny & doing tricks, A guy feeding the birds, rides games and of cores the beach .....This was on my bucket list and it didn't let me down at all I would strongly recommend it to anyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaylamarier2016
20,Santa Monica Pier,"really was a let down, I was expecting so much more but found the area very seedy and trashy and a lot of homeless. Weather wasn't great when we visited so probably didn't help us enjoy, but even with perfect weather I woukdn't visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MakingMemories72
30,Worth a look,It's beautiful and has lovely views but there isn't a lot here. The buskers are entertaining and the souvineers are cheap and very cool. We probably spent less than an hour here but we didn't swim or go to the theme park. I only saw one homeless person unlike many of the other reviewers on here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimz0n
40,"Unique, nostalgic, and cool","Just a really cool place to check out in LA. It's really a throwback kinda place with the old wooden boardwalk extending out over the water. It's is very touristy and probably expensive to eat or drink anything, but I did see a few reasonable snack options. You can get great views and pics here, and ride a small roller coaster.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rlev13
50,The Carousel Alone is Worth the Visit,"The Pier is fun. Unless you love arcade games and amusement park rides you do not need to spend more than 90 minutes here. Great for people watching. And then there's the carousel. All hand made and fully restored, no two animals quite the same. There is an old-fashioned ice cream parlor in the carousel building ( with new-fashioned prices).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jarstar558
50,It's a wonderful piece of America,What can you say it's a piece of history and an American icon. Still had charm and quirkiness in.abundance . But at night it comes alive and sparkles. Awesome and not to be missed as it still has that old cheesy smaltz,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SeanH41
50,A must see when in LA,"Pier full of things to do. Offers amazing views of the City from the water and the visible Smog over the City. If you can, rent bikes and ride along the beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexmE2212MB
40,Interesting historical pier and surroundings,"Los Ángeles is not a beautifull city , but this is an interesting historical pier and surroundings where its supposed to be the end of Route 66.In general I cant understand how American cities have soooo many homeless people everywhere affecting all ages . It's sad",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fernandorO2844AU
50,LOVED IT,My son and I had the most wonderful time seeing the most beautiful sunset ever. the people we met there were so friendly the food was great and the ocean was awesome. seeing kids so happy enjoying themselves in the water and sand was priceless .We walked and laughed and took so many priceless pictures to share with our friends and family. Love seeing all the local talent show their God given talent at the pier. for sure going as many times as we can while visiting Los Angeles in the future.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MARYJANERAMOS
30,Bit intimidating,Wouldn't fancy taking young children along here at night. Lots of homeless and junkies but during the day it's a lovely place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeetyLouCheshire_UK
50,Beautiful place,Very nice place to visit with friends and family at anytime of the day but the views at night are wonderful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ithah
30,Okay,The sand is nice. The ocean is beautiful. The place has a feel of a tourist trap. There is a lot of garbage around. Homeless people are sleeping everywhere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/31chastityd
40,Nice walk along the pier.,"Let's be honest, it's a tourist trap. We love it anyway, but that's what it is. The only locals are the fishermen, buskers, and homeless. Prices are inflated, it's very crowded, and it's got kind of a county fair feeling to it, but we still go. We go because it's famous, and we as tourists like seeing famous places. I've visited several times in the past, and I'll continue to visit in the future, because it is what it is, and I like it. The views of the beach are outstanding, and it's a great way to spend maybe an hour or so just walking along and checking things out. Unless you're planning to go swimming or bask in the sun on the beach, and hour or two is all you really need. There is also the Third Street Promenade and a fairly new shopping mall right nearby, so there's plenty more to do if you're trying to fill part of a day and make the drive to Santa Monica worthwhile. There's a Bubba Gump restaurant right on the pier that will charge you tourist prices, but if you get a table next to a window, it's a great spot to take a break from the sun while still soaking in the surrounding views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellinDaveHead
30,Nice visit but completely foggy,"I am sure this place must be awesome on sunny days but my visit wasn't that great since the whole area was covered in dense fog. However, it wasn't very cold and one could easily take a quick dip in the waters. The whole place is very lively with different street performers, artists, eateries, and rides for the kids that has made it a popular place. Nevertheless, I would love to visit Santa Monica Pier on my every visit to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/167tarar
40,Interesting to walk around,Rides cater more to extremely small children. Parking around was affordable and somewhat abundant. Worth seeing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aarony396
40,Entertaining!!,Fun walk and view!! Many street entertainers along the way and many fun food stands as well as rides and an aquarium.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amypI2845SS
50,Day Trip to the Pier,"Took a day trip that included a stop at the Santa Monica Pier. Was very neat to see in person, lots of little gift and snack places. Didn't ride any rides. Beach was clean we went right up to the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/slightlyheavy
30,It's a pier,"I was a bit disappointed by what was on the pier. There were souvenir stores, food and an amusement park. Having been to Brighton pier I was expecting it to be alot bigger.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bakeryitem
30,Fun for an hour,"The pier is a must do for your first time in Santa Monica. The atmosphere is great and it feels like a vacation. You have few choices for food, great margaritas at the end of the pier and can have a little fun on the short rides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/COMTECIERGE
40,Beautiful but Expensive,"This is one of those stops that I feel everyone should see and, experience. It was beautiful and had a special charm about it. It's not overly crowded on weekdays but with the lack of seating, you'll be better off bringing a blanket and eating on the beach.The biggest off put about the pier was the prices. While I get that it's a tourist area where they are looking to make a buck; paying $9 for a small keychain or $30+ for a cheaply made Tshirt seems like a bit much.One thing I recommend doing is the Ferris wheel. It's nice and slow, so you can enjoy the ride and view. It's absolutely beautiful as the sun is setting. It's $8 a person (as of 9/26/16) which is reasonable. I recommend getting the wristband and going on the other rides as well. After 3 rides, it pays for itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/560arishac
40,Definitely worth a stroll,"I love the Santa Monica Pier. I love looking at it from my balcony at the Loews Hotel, and it is a great backdrop for photos - especially sunset photographs. The Pier itself is fun to stroll along -with the sign that starts Route 66, the iconic Ferris wheel, lots of souvenir shops and places to eat. It is also lovely to look back at the coastline from the end of the Pier. It doesn't take long though to complete your visit, so bring your swimmers and have a dip in the ocean, or walk up Colorado Blvde and shop along the 3rd Street Promenade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosebank1
50,A great place to see and be seen.,"Shops and restaurants with plenty of things to buy. Live music, people watching and the end of the famous Route 66 is the Santa Monica Pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CWaters41
50,Must see and do,"The pier offers something for everyone: food, fishing, people watching, ice cream and cotton candy, shopping, rides and a beautiful carrousel. Make this your destination then go to the beach or walk or bike the pavement below. Watch sand volleyball, stop at a cafe for a drink or take a walk to the 3rd Street Promenade or mall for shopping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/297PaulaL
40,Pokemon bliss,This is touristy and fun for a day. The pokemon hunting is beyond awesome in you have kids and want them thoroughly engaged. The views and vibe are totally cool so its a must when visiting or if you are local and need a partial day activity go. Make sure to park a few blocks away. Easier to escape and who doesn't need some exercise.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fredgee77
20,"Cheesy, but maybe that's what you want?","I liked being several hundred feet out into the bay, but everything else about the pier was a tourist trap crossed with a state fair. It seemed to attract tourist & people aiming to make a quick buck because it it attracts people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K8nTO
50,"Crowded, dated...carnival like atmosphere","Be prepared for crowds. Expensive parking. Carnival type atmosphere with rides, food vendors, loud music, craft artists. Good to see ONCE.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goaliemother
40,Fun in the sun,Lots to see and do along the pier.....Clean and family friendly atmosphere. We enjoyed a few rides and some fast food before wandering down to the beach.A beautiful stretch of the coastline and a great place to unwind and relax. All in all a pleasant few hours before we headed off up the coast.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/307JodieS
40,Historic fun walk on the pier,"We enjoyed this spot, especially the street performers. We saw some excellent singers on a Friday evening. Very very busy - might be better on week night. Beautiful ocean air, fun rides for kids. Not too many food choices here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brenna77
30,Pretty underwhelming to us...,"We might feel differently if we had small children who might enjoy the rides and the cheap junk, but to us, it was sort of a waste of time. I'm sure decades ago this was a big deal and we came because of its iconic reputation. But we walked down, turned around and walked back up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cathyinbothell
50,Awesome place,Santa Monica pier is a must do. Its a real lively place with great sunsets on clear days. Various restaurants and food places to dine or eat on the go.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/628mitchellw
50,Amazing place,"This is our 5 th visit to Santa Monica pier , we just love it and the atmosphere. We walked out and back and enjoyed the views and the stalls . Had a drink as was so warm today . Love it and it's a must if you are in Santa Monica, plus we have just driven Route 66 so we got a certificate from the man who had the kiosk on the pier to say we had completed the drive .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missjoani
50,A must see stop along the Pacific Highway,"A great beach with a pier that extends forever. Lots of shops and amusements. Don't miss the merry-go-round, one of the main attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/labouton
30,Superficial,Pretty beach. Lots of superficial people showing their bodies. Great for a good perve. Great for summer beach side holiday.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/830amiec
50,Fun atmosphere,"Our first time here. Found it to be a fun and vibrant tourist area with many restaurants, souvenir shops, rides, a lot of surfers to watch, people fishing and a beautiful sunset with the mountains in the background. It was packed with people, so great people watching area. So many playing Pokemon Go! You have to stop here when in the area. Large parking garage not too far away. Loved the atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelfromDuluth
50,Our favorite Santa Monica attraction!,Day or night this location provides everything and more for all. The roller coaster is our family favorite!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vesands
40,A must see local attraction,"The story behind the pier is evident if you hunt it out, maybe the local owners/council authority could make more of this? The pier is also the end/beginning of the historic Rout 66 ( depending on where you tart the trip).Sunset views from the right side of the pier are fabulous. I was surprised that there was not more places to eat or sit outside, maybe this could be addressed?A great location for a few hours of semi peace and tranquility, that's if your not disturbed by the throng of people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScampinIzzy
30,One of the sights!,"Always overcrowded with tourists,vendors and some unsavory characters it's still an iconic sight in Santa Monica that should be visited at least once for the very least a stroll and some pictures. The Palisades park overlooking the Pacific ocean along Ocean blvd offers nice views of the pier so it can be admired from afar if you don't want to deal with the crowds but I do recommend seeing some of the amusement park,it's old time carousel and Ferris wheel are always popular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ARodriguezP
50,World away from LA,A visit to Santa Monica is a must for a break from the hustle & bustle of LA. There is a beautiful big clean beach that's great for families with the permanent beach guards. You can stroll down the pier comfortably with it's fun fair rollercoaster and big wheel so iconic. There is plenty of parking and clean restrooms.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrackingJohn
40,Come see the hubbub,"This may be just like any seaside pier, but it's worth a visit if you are in the area. It's got your usual pier rides like a rollercoaster, things to eat like frozen custard, and a few restaurants - even a Bubba Gumps. You can stay and have some fun, or just have a leisurely stroll around the pier. Of course, there's also the lovely sandy beaches. Parking is a bit steep at $3 an hour or $12 flat, depending on where you park. However, it's only a short walk to downtown Santa Monica, where there is some great shopping. If the sun is shining, this will all seem even more worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doctorj42
20,Not what I expected,"Dirty , too many people , and lots off shady people hanging around, the homeless were everywhere and it's really in your face , we were gutted",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K1066QDchrisp

50,Pier in Santa Monica,"Having a really nice Navy Pier in Chicago I fell in love with Santa Monica Pier the first time we visited a few years ago. The place is so cool and has so much to offer, awesome beach, attractions, restaurants and of course the Pacific Ocean and the views (especially at night time). Most importantly for me of course was the fact that it's the very end of Route 66 that actually starts in Chicago!TIP: Definitely a must stop for Route 66 fans!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reedmangreg
40,SM pier,"Great place to hang out and people watch. We went in the evening and the place was jammed, rockin' with huckster activities.There is a seedy quality so use common sense and you will be fine. Ferris wheel, rides and other stuff like souvenirs and a restaurant at the end of the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/511jayp
40,"Great ""people watching"" spot","The Santa Monica pier is enjoyable to visit. I havent been to the area for over 20 years after moving north years ago. My has it changed. These days it is a very busy tourist stop, as compared to years ago when it was a local hangout for surfers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vitahawk
50,Beautiful,"I didn't know what to expect when coming here, but it exceeded expectations. This place is absolutely beautiful. To see the mountains and the ocean coming together is a sight to be seen.Would recommend everyone come here on their L.A. tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X3815ZQryanc
30,Lot of fun but nothing unique,"A popular and essential experience when in Santa Monica. Quite fun, but nothing particularly unique. There are many rides available, we can recommend the big wheel, which offers great views along the beach. There's a limited number of food options, with Bubba Gump's being the main restaurant. We enjoyed the Cookie Monster ice cream - but be aware of the after-effect of that much blue food dye! Really nice atmosphere along the pier. There is a large car park just beside the pier, but wheelchair access is slightly tricky, requiring using Bubba Gump's elevator.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TiaW_12
50,The best place to have fun by the beach,so many attractions and shops to see and right next to Venice beach fun for the entire family you would come back for more then just one visit it is the end of route 66 as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dudeman4949
20,Packed,"Apparently it is difficult to think that an open place like this may become so packed. But at twilight, everybody flock in droves to this sort of iconic place in Santa Monica. It bursts at the seams. It isn't worth to bear such a ""swarm of tourists"", from my point of view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elbab788
40,Great place,"Fun atmospere in a fancy city, why wouldn't you check it out!Tom Hanks had his fortune told by the same swammy I did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drewsusa
50,Bubba gumps,"Great place to go, beginning of Route 66, not to much to do here unless you have children as there is a lot of small rides for them. Bubba gumps is a must do quite pricey though but hey it's a must do, buy a cocktail and keep the glass, good souvenir and there are a few shops along pier as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/855machelleh
50,"First stop from las vegas, nevada trip",One of the tour offered in Las Vegas is a trip to Los Angeles California. The first stop on the Santa Monica Pier. this trip I did with my wife in a rented car. It is a place visited a day like Saturday. We arrived about 11:00 am and was packed. for parking chose the side of the pier. and on the pier you see many shows offered on the site. a familiar and relaxing atmosphere. time passes quickly in the pier. very good option to visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/848reyr

40,Great Atmosphere!!!,"Visited the beach and the pier on a Sunday afternoon and the place was buzzing!!There are no end of street shows, gift stalls, food stalls and restaurants like bubba gumps. There is also the fairground which is aimed at younger children plus things like trapeze lessons.This is the end of Route 66 too! Place is well worth a visit if in Santa Monica or/and LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmfhewett
30,Eclectic mix on a Sunday,"This is a busy place with an interesting mix of people, styles, ethnicities, foods and activities. It was crowded but orderly. We found we were among the oldest folks, and the least represented age group. We did ride the roller coaster, which I haven't done in years but did so to accompany our visitor.Having walked the pier and took a ride, I have no desire to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JRA_10

30,Good for the first time visitors,"It's definitely a must when visiting L.A. for the first time, but very touristy and crowded. We spent 1-2 hrs there, took some nice photos then moved on to more genuine places.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelxo
30,A pier is a pier,"It's a pier, it has all the generic pier amusements and some random people doing some random stuff which people actually stop to watch - this does go over my head! The beach is beautiful - just unfortunate we caught it on a hazy day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/troketia
30,"Pretty scenery, okay boardwalk.","The view was to die for. The pier was filthy as far as animals, bugs, and waste. I enjoyed the beachside away from the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kittycat501
40,Awesome time,We had a great time. This place was awesome. My honey had a great time in the water. We had great food at pier burger spot. Great entertaining on the pier. Please visit...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NELO64130
40,"Old time pier complete with beach, rides, arcades, hot dogs, fishermen, the smells, and the Pacific Ocean","Bring cash for a necessary $12 parking fee at the Santa Monica Pier. You kind of get dumped into line as you head for the beach/pier signs and there's no escape. They want $12 flat in cash to park in the sun. But, it IS next to an expansive, beautiful beach with mountains in the background, and it only a few steps up to the Pier itself and all that it entails. If you need a bathroom, try to wait until you are up on the Pier rather than the kind of sketchy ones on ground level next to the parking lot. Things have not been remodeled in a good while, generally speaking, but I think the point is to preserve that era - The Pier was founded in 1975 and it is a throwback to that time still. It has an air of 'hippie' about it and the boardwalk itself is very uneven and bumpy. Be careful, don't be put off but a person could easily trip if you are looking all around and not paying attention to the curbs and bumps on the boardwalk. There are shops, food stands, a Taco Bell, a fine Albright Seafood Restaurant and ever fun, Bubba Gump restaurant which houses a sort of movie Forest Gump memorabilia museum display all over the premises. Go for a stroll, a drink, the people watching, the fresh air and gorgeous view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lsihrofhhisc
20,Eh,A nice pier but just a tourist pit stop. We had a wander about and then left to explore more of Santa Monica.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexandraadventure
20,Nothing special,"The Santa Monica Pier is nothing special. It is neat to see at a distance at night because of the unique lighting of the Ferris wheel and roller coaster. During the day it's just another very crowded place with lots of junk food, over-priced souvenirs, street performers, etc. I wouldn't recommend making an effort to visit the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/666paml
50,My favourite place in LA,"Everything about the pier is amazing - the food smells amazing, there are street performers and artists everywhere (one has the cutest boxer, I fell head over heels in love with her!), good food and phenomenal sunset views! Saw a Sea Lion swimming away, played a couple of video games at the arcade and spent hours just people watching and enjoying the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rrrebekah
30,"It's a pier, with Tourists and Touristy things on it...","That's it really, if you want candy floss, Ferris Wheels and to be pushed and shoved around , go for it..you better off heading up the beach to Venice..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dizzydisney
50,Just like the movies!,Beautiful! Busy! Lovely place to visit with family that includes children. We took a stroll on the pier and dined at Bubba Gump. Pricey however oh so delicious. Spent an entire day in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelbug_aust
30,"Sunset was great, that's about it","The sunset was brilliant over the beach and the photo's looked great but that was the highlight. The homeless unfortunately flock here of a night and they are on your entry down to the pier, on the pier and at the end of the pier. Some of the buskers have talent, others have none. The whole place after the sunsets has a strange edgy vibe to it and then the gangs come out. No police in sight either. Come for sunset but then leave. I have been to some very dicey places in the world and felt perfectly safe, i didn't have that here after dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H0bbits_travels
50,Fun for Everyone,"Girls night out. Went on week-end. The area was alive with restaurants, beach goers, tourists and locals alike. The walk down the pier was short/ you can look at the beach as you stroll along -there is a large Ferris wheel and carnival rides on the pier. As you walk to the end you will see fast foods, sit down restaurants, gift shops and locals singing,dancing and playing instruments. You reach the end of the pier and visit a lifesaving museum. There is also a Mexican restaurant with outside seating...yup. We sat outside and had a refreshing drink.. A must see",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roseo146
50,Go on the Ferris Wheel,"We went in the evening and went on the ferris wheel. It is solar powered, which is very cool, and the ride is pretty long. After a hot day it was very cool, and gave a great over view of the city. The pier is hopping, there are lots of rides and people selling things. Really nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vitarachel
40,Nice pier,"To mark the end of our journey across Route 66, from Chicago we made it to the pier! The end of the Route 66 sign was there, and we got our certificate from the Route 66 stand of the nice chap who works and is an ambassador for the Route.We want on a couple of the rides which was good and not too badly priced.Couple of entertaining acts along the pier, but have to say I recognised the place a bit after googling it turned out its the pier used for GTA! Very impressive rockstar!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndyHAM29
50,Best pier along the LA area,A busy and bussling pier with a lots to do and see. Close to downtown LA and the traffic can be a nightmare...however never fails to impress.Great for all and of all ages....midweek visits are recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tedpm
30,Meh,We went there just to walk the pier and see what it was about. The aquarium was closed and had weird hours and the pier was smelly as well as the beach. I wasn't impressed and I was kinda bummed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonis309
30,Took the walk because we were there..Not what I expected!,"We visited at night and it was very crowded. Keep your valuables protected as it is a mix of street performers, tourists and the homeless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolD117
30,Lively Pier,"It's kind of commercialize Pier at Santa Monica with lots of people, entertainment and foods. The pier itself had the charm with street performers and artists but the crowd made it kind of not easy to move about and not good for photographer like me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joanadventure
50,Pier,"This is a pier and a half. it gives you everything most imported bottles of water when its very hot. Stalls, rides , a big wheel ,people fishing , views of the beach for miles both sides. its one of the best piers I have ever visited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephenbB451KB
30,Nice but crowded,"We were there on a weekend. It felt like the entire state had descended on the pier. Here is what we learnt. Get there early, reserve your parking and grab a decent spot on the beach. Plan good or lunch else it's hours of waiting. Walk the pier it's got great performances. We in particular like the lady that did name paintings",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/not-a-big-city-girl
40,Pokemon Heaven,"This is a great place to come and collect pokemon! Lots of pokestops all with lures going all the time. It was also fun people watch, listening to the musicians and watching the dancers. There is an amusement park which is great if you have kids. The pier is a bit tacky, but still fun to check out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoctorDerm1
50,Great pier with plenty to do,"This pier was beautiful with plenty to do and great views across the beaches. It is a tourist trap so expect to be ripped off with prices, but certainly worth a visit. Parking is pretty cheap at $12 for the day next to the pier. We had already paid $20 to park on Sears though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m4rcus2001
50,Spend the day at the beach...,"And don't miss the amusement park! It hosts a couple of iconic landmarks, the beach is great (wide, good sand and clean) and the Pacific is so nice to swim in. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andra_badea
10,Much ado about nothing,Was visiting my family in the area and we all decided to go and visit the SantaMonica Pier as we had heard so much about it.Well honestly the entire experience was pretty bad.. It took us 45 minutes to find parking.. Then it was so crowded that we were worried about the safety of the smaller children.. The pier itself had all the charm with street performers and artists but the crowd made it impossible to enjoy it.I feel it would have been better to spend the time at home,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmitJ753
50,Happy birthday to me! A stroll on the pier made the day....,"When I lived in Santa Monica, the pier was kind of a dump. So was most of the downtown area. Look at it now! It was a beautiful day and I thoroughly enjoyed the stroll and people watching. One suggestion....standard pricing for water. A couple places charged $4 a bottle, other places $2, which is reasonable. If you stay anywhere in L.A., the pier is simple to reach by public transportation...and so iconic. There are games and rides and souvenirs that will cost you, but the view of the ocean and the shoreline is priceless. It was a great visit that made me wonder why I ever moved away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeMeDaVinci
40,Fun day,The pier was clean. People watching was fun. The funnel cake was great. Overall just a good fun day at the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AirMode
30,Crowded and what?,"Have been here several times over the years and as there is only amusement and crap food, I only strolled through the masses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HexiH
50,Great for people watching and wandring,Lovely walk to the end of the pier- apparently you can often see whales off the end where there's fishing. Surrounding areas are lovely too- the architecture is well worth a look.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jackieillustrator
30,Tacky,The pier is tacky and has fairground rides crammed on to it. The beach is much better. There is free WiFi on the pier so just sit on the beach next to the pier of you want it.Pokemon Go is also amazing in this area. If you live here there is no excuse for not having amazing pokemon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jakhello147
20,Pokemon Go has ruined this place!,"I know, you're probably thinking ""what a strange title for a review"". Well, this beach is so crammed full of people (even on weekdays outside of school holidays) and I know the reason is Pokemon Go.If you walk along the pier, you won't get very far due to the thousands of people there (most catching pokemon). If you walk along the beach, you will be greeted with cigarette butts and litter everywhere.This is such a tourist attraction, but I'd suggest you forget the hype. (Unless you're interested in catching pokemon, in which case Santa Monica is great for that). But if you're looking for a relaxing day at the beach, take a trip down to Manhatten, Hermosa or Redondo beach instead --- cleaner, safer and way less people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wanderersoftheworld
50,The pier,"We stayed at the Lowe's very close to the pier we had nice walks from the hotel to the Pier every daySome amazing musicians , we had a great lunch and the views are amazing",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thenowakfamily

40,Always a treat,"We always enjoy walking the Pier.Beach is huge and always room here. The treat is walking or riding a bike to take it all in. Make sure you notice Shutters , it's like @ $500 a night so check it out, maybe for a drink.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Budmanri
40,Fun spot to people watch and have a drink over the ocean,We were staying close by and walked over here a couple times. There are several rides(we didn't do any) had a big arcade my son enjoyed. There was a free concert on Thur night-packed but fun. Very touristy but we were tourists so enjoyed going and having a drink and people watching.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LVAmy
40,Great views and food,"The Santa Monica pier is one of our favorite places to visit! The Summer Concert series was just wrapping up and drew thousands of attendees. Well worth planning a visit to enjoy on Thursday nights. Get there early to stake out a spot on the beach to enjoy. The volume on the pier was a bit too much for a geezer like me but, the music was fantastic! The amusement park on the pier was very clean and well run. As we walked through I was thinking of how much fun my grandkids would have had there. Great visit and good times!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JungleJym55
50,Fun California times,Had a blast on the pier. We love visiting image pier every year we go visit Cali. It so fun to people watch and to sit back and watch the waves. We ate at the Mexican restaurant at the end of the pier and they had the best free chips and dip!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vinh952
40,Variety,"Many different sights and sounds on the pier, from the homeless to struggling musicians ( and some are really good). Many gift and food choices and a great view of the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeneB579
40,First trip to site see in California,The Pier is so busy there is barely room to walk. Lots of performers taking tips. Good view of The Pacific.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MBLOVER2014
40,Go early,Go for the view of the ocean and because it was the western end of Route 66. Go for the Albright or even for Bubba Gump (God help you). But go early. On a bright SoCal morning when there are no crowds it's beautiful. Late in the day it's the third circle of hell because of the crowd.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Logophiliac
50,Lovely,"The pier is great, lots going on. Loads of little stalls to look around as well as e fairground rides.Had funnel cake...omg was lovely. Could only manage one between two as so big.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stoney0404
40,Nice vibe,"Went along one afternoon to the pier and also walked along the beach from Santa Monica to Venice. The pier is alive with people, traders restaurants and of course the amusement Park. The vibe was friendly and the whole place seemed pretty relaxed. We had a great steak at Rusty's. The mountain backdrop to the beach is just beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/893janicem
50,The real deal.,It's all going on. Tons of folk all out perambulating. Lots of nice street sellers. Fishermen and courting couples at the end.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carnalbanagh
50,Landmark tourist attraction,The Santa Monica Pier is busy all year round. It offers many restaurants and tourist shopping opportunities. You can go any time and hear a wonderful variety of languages from all over the world and see a celebrity or two.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/724lauriew
50,So Much Fun!,"This place is fun during the day time for people watching and rides, and then at night looks spectacular as everything lights up! A classic California experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/74mercedesk
50,Great location to spend a day,"Santa Monica pier is definitely worth the drive. Parking is available directly on site. Even if it's a bit expensive with 12 dollars for a full day. The beach is clean and simply huge. I recommend coming during the week, as on the weekend it is overcrowded. The pier offers all kinds of restaurants and entertainment. The amusement park with its roller coasters offer an amazing view of the ocean and beach. If you get tired of the beach and the pier you can just walk up from the pier to Colorado street until you reach 3rd street on the left. There is a mall and a beautiful open air shopping district with a cinema.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicolesY137XH
40,Fun for the family!,Fun environment and lots of things to do. Great day at the beach. Games for the kids and lots of food choices so you can spend a few hours with the kids and never get bored.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/554shanel
40,Pretty Cool,"It was pretty cool to see it in real life as it has been in so many movies.The pier itself is great for photos.The beach is BEAUTIFUL we even saw dolphinsWalk to Venice Beach and Muscle Beach get a ride back in a buggy.Be prepared for homeless people everywhere and lots of smell of pot.The slight wind can fool you into thinking that you aren't cooking in that sun, so bring sun block and lots of it.Super fun and awesome for photos",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CryslynIqaluit
50,Awesome Chill-out Spot,"Santa Monica Pier is in a great location for spending time with friends. Everything is here, a fair, food stalls, game stalls, ocean views, the beach, fishing spots, and so much more. It wasn't too busy when I went but I can imagine in the peak of summer this place would be incredible. Definitely recommend to anyone around the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G8656MPsamuelm
30,Good Family Fun,"We enjoyed the day here with our two teens. They rode the rides, played games and ate loads of junk food. The pier is great for the views, people watching and watching the sun set. Most importantly, the cost for a family of four to spend the day at the pier was very fair. This is a must do if you are in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Texangal39
50,Nice to visit - hire a bike,Early morning is quiet with a chilled at atmosphere- nice for a walk and a coffee - late pm is very busy but so beautiful for the sunset followed by a nice mealWe hired a tandem bike with the kids and rode to Venice beach - really nice day out,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stewandvadar
40,Sunny afternoon wander,"Santa Monica Pier is referred to by most as a must see attraction. Certainly it was enjoyable, however your enjoyment will likely be determined by what you are looking for. The Pier was sun-drenched during our wander and good for people watching. The Pier offers great views, but you must compete with the crowds. Food on offer was standard American fare, lots of deep fried goods and sugar, incredibly over priced and in our experience, the service was pretty appalling.The Pier also offer carnival style rides for kid so and the young at heart, but be prepared to pay!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smeli_Meli
50,Loved the scenery!,I visited the pier a Saturday morning and it was a perfect weather and a beautiful day as well. I went on the attractions and walked along the sidewalk of the beach area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tania0926
50,End of the road.,"We parked near Venice Beach after touring that area we strolled along the promenade / boardwalk to Santa Monica Pier. It's also the West Coast end of Route 66 and you have to get a picture at the sign. There are loads of shops, cafes and attractions here including a small coaster. trapeze and big wheel. The views up and down the coast and the beach look great too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TartanTeddyBear
40,Fun place,Definitely a plane to see when visiting SoCal ! We came early in the morning for a beautiful photo ops and also at night for the amazing energy. Great for family fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MartaDias
40,Fun in The sun,"Been here so many times..its so refreshing, great views of the ocean, there's games and kids rides as well as adult rides..they have shows and people making art along side the pier..a couple of restaurants and shopping stores with great souvenirs.You will have fun with the whole family as well as by yourself...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/676jcg
50,So fun!,"If you get a hot day it's great! We got ice creams, got the full pass for the rides and went on them all and had an evening of being big kids. Watch the sunset at the bar nearby and relax.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HollieC648
30,A small Carnival over the Ocean,"My experience here was average. It seemed to be bombarded with tourists, and everyone was literally playing Pokemon Go. Nevertheless, still a place you need to visit when in the area. There's a Ferris wheel, a roller coaster and some other rides. Along with an arcade, Merry-go-round, and other carnival attractions. There's a lot you can do here and still have access to the beach. Don't forget the carnival food!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nole627
40,Worth a visit,"Took the bus from Hollywood. The beach is very nice and clean. The board walk is great. The pier itself is full of restaurants so no need to go hungry. There were many people fishing however, we did not see anyone catch anything. There are many homeless people living here as in Hollywood, quite sad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coolgranma69
40,"iconic pier, great views","Such an iconic pier as it's the west coast end of Route 66. Lots of stores, cafes and attractions here. Fantastic views up and down the coast. Only a short walk to Muscle Beach too so make sure you stop by there too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevebootes
40,Great views,"Went there on Sunday afternoon. It was very crowded, but we enjoyed the views , food and people watching. Also noted too many beggars there and it's quite annoying.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ohauiti
30,Nothing special,It is nice to walk around and see it if you are there anyway but compared to the movies and TV it looked a lot smaller than I had expected,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatriciaS107
30,Enjoy yourself,"Went to the Santa Monica pier after renting bicycles, it was probably about a 7 mile bike ride. If you love people watching and the beach scene the ride will come and go in a minute with all there is to see from Venice Beach. The rides are a OK, enjoy yourself have a little fun can be very expensive, but well worth your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lcr1776

50,Day out with hubby,"Wanted to just get away for a day.. So we decided a drive to Santa Monica pier would be a great place to walk along enjoy the sites, have a bite to eat and enjoy the fresh air.well worth the drive,the day was beautiful! The sites,the families,the couples, visiting the places that have made memories for us since our kids were small. Great place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/71jerrig
50,Fun at the fair,We bought a couple of day passes which were perfect for letting the kids run riot. They loved the roller coaster and the ice cream!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaraD462
30,Tourist trap but everyone should go once,"Good for kids or anyone who is going to LA for the first time. Once you've been you'll notice it in dozens of movies and commercials. Very safe, lots of police around, a carnival year round. One time we saw every single Ms.America contestant there for a photo shoot, the spouse was not impressed but I took dozens of great photos anyhow!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdrockDallas
30,"Go for the experience, then go spend your time somewhere else","Often seen in movies and on t.v., this well-known pier is extremely busy. It is a vibrant area with interesting people and activities for everyone. People tend to keep to themselves, and that's fine, but a few people were extremely rude. (If you walk on the beach and go under the pier, many people under there are sketchy and trying to fool around in the sand with their partner. They seemed angry that so many people were walking by while they were trying to ""get busy,"" and some of them made rude comments at passersby. I didn't like the vibe of this area) The friendliest people were the fellow Iowans we saw who had also attended the Rose Bowl Game, and several locals who stopped to comment or ask us questions about Iowa. It was very funny to hear their perceptions of middle America, and some of them told us we (Iowans) were entertaining to watch. I got a kick out of that! A half-day here was enough for us as it is busy, touristy (we don't mind touristy in small doses), and not enough to hold our interest for longer than four hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LovesIowa
10,Overcrowded not worth the visit,"We have heard so much about the place and how much charming it is, but once we reached the Pier we have a difficult time to find a parking then once we got one and start walking toward the beach we surprised by how much the place was over crowded and many homeless, We did not feels comfortable and we decided to head back to our car.I will never go back to this place and will never recommend it to any one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aboaziz
40,Must visit,This is my second time I come here. It is very nice to walk out to the pier and see all the people and the sea. You have also lot of restaurants here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tingman1
30,"Fun pier, great views",The pier has a carnival like atmosphere with small stands for shopping. The food options are scarce and the Italian restaurant at the beginning of the pier is full of rude employees. Great for viewing the beach but find someplace else to eat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferwP1704UM
40,Great day out,Catched the hop on hop off bus out to the Santa Monica the beach was lovely loads to look at eat at an things to see only a small drive down to Venice beach with also is a great place to visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/68neridab
50,Music&sun,"It was my first visit to Santa Monica pier ,the music was every where ,the sun was warm and the air was fresh . I don't know if it is always or just my luck ,but every one was very friendly . There were many white birds around us.the place were like a dream .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/627heshamr
50,Fun!,"Had a blast here!! Spent the day at the pier. Shopping, eating, and then a few hours at the beach. Rode the farris wheel and completly enjoyed it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0601sonjab
30,Nice spot for an iconic photo!,"Went recently at night. Number one thing to note, it was much cooler in LA at night during Sept long weeknd than I had anticipated. It was quite cold that night when we went. Definitely needed pants and sweater.I would suggest parking at the mall and walking down. It's a short comfortable walk and easy to find parking at the mall.We went on a Friday night and it was super busy. We didn't mind it being packed since it was so cold. Having more people around made it a tiny bit warmer!The boardwalk is nice and there are touristy shops for snacks and souvenirs as you make your way down. There were some performers along the way down too, which created a nice ambiance.The iconic ferris wheel did not disappoint. I'm glad we went at night because it was nice seeing it lit up. It was a little tough getting a good photo of it at night, but we still enjoyed the view.I think if it was warmer we would've hung around much longer. The attractions seemed more geared towards families with small children (which we were not).Definitely a good stop to make. I think it'd be a great date spot for those looking for a romantic destination while visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mzbreee
30,Better than Venice Beach!,We visited the Pier on a Sunday - it was very busy with people and the Pier has character but is looking a little dated. The beach and restaurants are a far sight nicer than Venice Beach so if you have to choose for a family I'd pick Santa Monica,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/835raewynb
50,Must See Part of LA,"The Santa Monica Pier must be seen. Though parking can be quite hard (as can the hideous traffic in and out of Santa Monica for that matter), if you are new to Los Angeles it's something you really should see.The pier includes a small aquarium, a historic indoor merry-go-round, several restaurants and eateries, a place to learn or try trapeze and trampoline, and a decent amusement park with a magnificent, solar powered and spectacularly lit ferris wheel that offers amazing views up and down the California coastline and the town of Santa Monica and beyond.Best of all, the people watching is pretty amazing. Make sure you also leave the pier and walk south along the boardwalk to get a real feel for Santa Monica. You may even want to continue walking south to Venice and muscle beach, or, better yet, rent a single or tandem bicycle and explore the area via an excellent bike path you can ride, skate or a run on.The area self of the pier can be a little rough at times, so just be aware of your surroundings, but it's something you must see and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dannyk715
50,Cool place,Beach was nice. We went during may so the water a cold. However the weather was beautiful. We went on a bike ride and ate at a near by restaurant on the pier,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/52catalinab
30,Visting from St.louis,We parked at a hotel parking lot due to the pier lot being full..wasnt too bad of a walk. A few homeless people but no one approached us. We bought some souvenirs for a pretty decent price but workers were rude and kept talking to one another instead of helping. wasnt too much to see but could have been due to us going on a friday morning aroung 11am.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monikat154
40,Its a Pier.,"What can I say, I love a Pier, its nice to see that fishing is allowed on this one, so many in the UK don't allow people to actually use them. Well done to the Pier operators.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grabul
40,Great beach and place for a day,"We spent a day on the beach, walked around, had some cocktails. Great place to jang out, you can ride bikes, you can go on the rides, eat, drink, sit on the beach and dream!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arnela6
40,Interesting and talented people,Took the hour long metro ride from 7thand rented bikes from Meg just up the street from the pier. Couldn't have asked for a better way to spend the day. The musicians and artists could hold your interest for hours then add in the tourists and you realize one day isn't nearly enough. Skip the restaurant at the end though and travel down to Venice beach for plenty of food options.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gymmyball
30,Sarah,California as I had pictured it beautiful beach beautiful Pier clean busy beautiful homes and condos surrounding the shore we go back again in a minute !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P3899MBsarahh
30,normal,nothing much to do n see on the pier itself. children may like the amusement park there. but there are lots of outdoor u can do nearby. n it is a great Walk from santa monica pier to Venice beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/starystarynite
40,Lovely but tacky,I think it's a bit obvious saying that the pier is tacky. It's a great location if you have never been to SM before but if you frequently visit I don't know anyone who has gone here twice! Tick it off the bucket list & move on.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abigailalicex
50,Just to relax and watch people,"It was a sunny and windy September, lots of tourists and locals as well. Nice place to relax, watch and meet people. A nice place to shops for souvenirs if you're a tourist like me. There was one guy, he's musician, playing guitar at the pier, he was good. Overall I enjoyed my visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/inkaniya
50,Loved it,"Santa Monica is a place I've always wanted to visit and I was not disappointed. The pier area is great, lots of restaurants and small shops selling things. It's clean and easy to walk up and down even when there are large crowds. The bars and restaurants around are great and be sure to checkout 3rd street, a pedestrianised street full of great shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noleybaby
50,Went to Thursday free concert Great experince 🌌,"A lot of people came out to enjoy the free concert, everyone had a nice evening great for family's. Rides were closed, unfortually I got there too late. The rides do remain lite.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TaraZ37

50,Day Trip To Santa Monica,"Went to spend the day on the beach from Las Vegas, always a lovely day here plenty to do and the pier if fantastic for all age groups. Plenty of places to eat, lots of gift shops and not forgetting the rides especially the big wheel, with fantastic views. What's not to enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A5836NEsusanl
50,Great for a look on a warm day,"Great place to go for a walk and see everything thats happening, lots of food and things too do for the kids too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlenR803
30,Amazing place to bike ride,We hired some bikes. This place is nicer than Venice beach and there are less druggies around and more uptown cafes at this end. However having said that there are a lot beggars around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Niall030598
50,FUN FOR THE WEEKENDS,"Fun, Sports, Gastronomy, Park, Shops and Restaurants - specially for the weekends. Best spot for sunset",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/698daniellea
50,Everything you'd expect - a place that causes you to smile,"Street musicians, amusement rides, carnival games, restaurants, gift carts, tons of tourists. It's just a happy place - a party for your senses - and definitely worth a visit. My husband and I strolled the pier for about 90 minutes taking it all in. I remarked, ""it's just like I imagined"" - which is a good thing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pjpharless
30,"Like any other pier, plus amusement rides","We were in LA for three days & kept planning to go the the pier but our schedule was just so busy... The morning we left LA, we decided to stop by there in the early morning. Everything was closed, as they don't open rides until 11 or noon, forgot the exact time. My husband and son decided to do some Pokemon hunting, they were able to find a lot of them by the pier. You do have to pay for parking as well ($10-15) and the bathrooms by the pier are extremely disgusting and gross, not to mention, no baby changing station. It's really just like any other beach with a pier. At the very end of the pier, is an area for fishing. We watched people fish and even saw a seal swimming through. The beach itself was dirty, I've been to nicer beaches in Florida. There were tons of seagulls and trash laying around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saewhat9009
20,Too Busy and Congested,We found Santa Monica itself to be really busy and congested. It's hard to find parking for just an hour or so. The pier area is quite busy. There are many other piers in California that are much less congested and a bit easier to navigate. I think this one is probably good for a visit of several hours and one where you don't mind walking long distances to see everything.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MisterMVA
50,Beautiful,"It's definitely a tourist trap, but with good reason. It's a beautiful spot that offers ocean views, good food, and a ferris wheel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FootTrafficTravelers
50,Pokemon hotspot,"This place is so beautiful both day and night. The pier stretches out into the water for great views of the surrounding coastline and at night the colourful lights from the amusement park, Pacific Park, are brilliant and stunning, especially the changing patterns of the solar-powered LED lights on the giant Ferris wheel. The pier is a good place for a casual stroll. There are restaurants, shops, an arcade, the amusement rides, talented street performers, and the marker for the end of Route 66. A trapeze school is located on the pier and we were lucky to see the students practicing outdoors.For Pokemon hunters, don't miss this attraction and fill up on Pokeballs before arriving. There are plenty of Pokestops, with perpetual lures and hundreds of fellow Pokemon hunters. Great for both water and rock types, and also rare Pokemon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Buffyanna
40,Go here not Venice beach,"Significantly mor up market than Venice beach, better food, less freaks and less drugs, a great pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Woodychester1
20,A standard tacky place,This pier is a standard tacky place with all the things that you might expect from a Blackpool type place with sun. No class and little to hold your interest.The walk along the beach is lovely.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/757MartinG757
40,Beginning / end of Route 66,"Good look for a first time, however it is very crowded.Good place to people watch.Food is a bit limited so if your hungry, best to head up into Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y4896BWmattp
10,The last place to be in Santa Monica,"This place is a tourist trap, very crowded, subpar shopping and food. There are so many good things to do in Santa Monica that i will recommend to leave this as your last.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JavierRicco
50,Lots to do!,"Really beautiful beach - you can just chill on the beach sunbathing, go on the observation wheel (which is solar powered - so cool) or watch various groups working out at the original muscle beach - alternatively you can hire bikes pretty cheap and cycle down to Venice beach for a change of scenery!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatieC38
40,"Long layover at LAX, so we explore","With a long layover at LAX we rented a car and went for a drive. Santa Monica was on the list as a place you could visit and still make it back for our flight. The pier is the end of route 66 which we did not know at the time. So that's an added smile on your face when you find that out. We strolled the pier and did some people watching. Also got to see some fishermen catch some fish. As a fisherman myself I was really surprised at the fish cleaning stations on the pier. With running water. My guess is that the dumping of the fish guts helps to bring more fish in, like a chum log would. Ar restaurant at the end of the pier had sine good views for the dinners. Because they blocked off anyone from fishing in front of the Windows. Which I think is fare. No-one wants to be eating dinner and not be able to see the beach. There are many little cats selling art and tee shirts. An arcade for the kids to sirens some money in playing the boardwalk games. I think if your in the area you should take some time for a walk on the pier at Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JRSears
50,Iconic,"We stayed in Santa Monica over New Year 2015-16 and spent a good few hours on the pier. I loved Zoltar (please tell me you've seen ""Big""?!) and the end of the pier; my boyfriend loved the route 66 facts and Bubba Gump (unfortunately we didn't eat there this trip, next time!). The pier is iconic, historic and emotive; you can't help but realise the feet that have come before and will follow after. I can't wait to be there again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clarew486
30,round and round,"We booked tickets online, with a small discount to the Pacific Park on the pier. The attractions/rides are more geared to young children or teens, but we enjoyed ourselves, being slightly older. It was the Labour Day Monday, so there were wall to wall people along the pier, so it was a bit chaotic, but fun nonetheless",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mammatVancouver

50,Loved the atmosphere!,"The water was SUPER cold, but that didn't stop my 7 and 9 yr old boys and the rest of the people...LOL!. It was such a great place to just sit out and enjoy the sun. The attractions were a nice addition as well as the street artist with great talent. I'm from the East Coast, so I enjoyed Cali's summer heat....no humidity whatsoever!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuvTravel14_1
50,Must see,The pier was beautiful and you must walk up into town for the great shopping. The downtown and pier has free street wifi. Lots of Pokemon catching for my kids. We really enjoyed this outing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Winstongate
40,A fun place to spend the afternoon,"Strolling around the pier one afternoon after a business conference adjourned was a lot of fun. There was an obvious police presence, so there was absolutely no shenanigans. There are lots of souvenir shops and restaurants. Make sure you ride the ferris wheel and take the kids to the carnival.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K3683MSjessicam
40,"lots of cool shops, rides, street musicians, food - something for everyone","came here as part of our venice beach boardwalk cruise -- it's about 2 miles north. nice walk to and from along the beach. the pier is very cool with all the usual accoutrements you'd expect to see -- the street musicians displaying their talents and offering CDs for sale, restaurants to meet everyone's tastes, amusement park rides, the ocean to stare at, the people... perfect for a stroll at any time of day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joemontana16

40,Just okay,"Did not love the pier. It was just okay. It felt very commercial to me. The highlight was seeing ""Zoltar"" from the movie BIG. It was busy. There were a lot of people and a very strong police presence. The beach is beautiful and the area is nicely kept. Just did not find it exciting or very interesting. It is however, a beautiful spot to watch the sunset!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CindyRK55
40,Nice day out,Pleasant atmosphere and a variety of attractions on the pier. Nice bars and restaurants nearby. Nice day out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizbH8756KR
30,Packed!,The pier was packed with people but the views of the Pacific were nice. Some restaurants and stores but mostly tourist trap type places. Lots of musicians playing and some artists selling their wares. Pay to play rides and carnival games for the kids. Parking was packed but several lots available around the area. Most surprising was the abundance of clean bathrooms. I would love to visit when not so crowded. It think it would be a better experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evansvuk
50,Some of my best memories,Were made here...I grew up in la. Technically I'm a valley girl but spent most of my teen years on the other side exploring Hollywood and venice on foot. The pier is so beautiful and so much fun. Just be careful after dark if you aren't familiar with the area. Kk? Or at least ladies please don't walk around at by yourself.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zoeyd118
50,Lazy Evening Stroll,A good place to spend a lazy evening stroll or just sitting by the bench behind the Ferris wheel facing the ocean. Stop by Route 66 marker.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JerryEsmillo
30,Got to see it,"It's nice. Something you need to see on your trip!It is very crowded and touristy. Very over priced.We had a great time nonetheless.Try to avoid Friday nights and weekends as it's very packed, could barely move down the pier, felt like sardines!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/370sarahk
20,Very busy for nothing,Just a bunch of restaurants packed in a pear as if it means to spoil the mood and scenery of the wide beach ..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joe080
30,"Nice to have been there, but I won't return","Crowded with loads of tourists, if you visit in summer. Plain and trashy, unless you visit off season. Beggars",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Petfar
30,Worth a visit,"Took three teens an a ten year old to experience the pier, although it was a fun day out we did feel the wrist bands were a bit pricey for the amount of rides on offer.Beach is obviously beautiful as are the views from the end of the pier.Parking was easy, close by and cheap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jodegirl77

50,Started out as a short stroll.,The Santa Monica Pier held a couple of surprises. The first was the discovery that it is the end of Route 66. Something we are going to travel in near future. The other surprise was the numerous views from the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q9860NKtimm
40,Lives up to its name...,"Visited over Labor Day weekend when it was swarming with people plus the Pokemon hunters...the close by parking lots were full at 10:30 am but we parked at the civic lot near the courthouse and only paid $4 for several hours...crowded, touristy and great people watching..Something fun for everyone...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TouristFromLA
50,"Nice views, good place to see","This is a free area to visit with very accessible and cheap parking so well worth a visit. Nice views, interesting to walk around for an hour",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MatthewL913
30,Tacky,"It may be famous, it may be a national treasure, it may attract thousands of people.....but, to me, it was crowded (OK it was Labor Day), almost impossible to move in places, and, frankly tawdry.There were buskers, evangelists, hawkers, tacky stalls with souvenirs, and quite a bit of emphasis on the fact that this was the end of the old Route 66 (a lot of the t-shirts and caps made reference to this in their logos.Hey, this is pretty negative - sorry. So.... a rather pleasant carousel, great place to people watch, excellent views of the beautiful beach and ocean, good for families. Check!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandys869
30,Iconic,"This place is cool, very iconic, but that's all. It's beautiful to see, hard to walk on due to the people traffic so it's hard to review. I loved seeing it, had fun here but it's just so busy and expensive. I barged into a lot of people, on purpose too, because they're just so ignorant and won't move, especially the Pokemon players.The famous ""end of Route 66"" sign is cool. The food is expensive, Pacific park is expensive, the boardwalk is always busy even at night time, the beach is right there and very very busy. It's a good place for people watching and hearing a variety of live music.Parking at the pier is about $12 a day and of course it's busy! The spaces are also very tight, not somewhere you want to take a large car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R0wi3

The Ferris wheel has a self-powered LED lighting system that is quite spectacular at night. The views from the pier are also lovely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jonathan575
40,Fun but A Lot Of People!!,Recently went with some friends and our two-year-old. Definitely a great people watching place. We loved all the musicians playing along the pier and bought one of their CDs. We also enjoyed the outdoor rides. Parking can be crazy and there's a lot of people. We found that you need to have cash to pay for parking and that it's best to go in the morning to get a spot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dinoalita
40,Let's soak up some sun and people watch,People watching at its finest...the pier is typically super busy at least every time that I have visited. Plenty of snack stands and performers alike and if your bold enough you can ride one of the rides,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WeAdoreTravl

50,Great place,"Love this place it's full of interesting characters and is a really unique place. There is something for everyone from food outlets, shopping, street entertainment and even the iconic big wheel. So much to do and see but I enjoyed sitting on a bench watching the sea listening to one of the many music artists performing.Visit at night as well for a completely different vibe.Also a hub for Pokemon hunters as there was hundreds of people walking around with their phones in front of their faces, which was a funny sight to see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidpH4472TF

20,Definitely don't go on the weekend,We went as a stop over on our way to Disneyland. It was so overly crowded it was impossible to even get food.

50,Well worth the walk,"After parking up in Venice Beach and walking round there for a while, we set off walking up to Santa Monica. Around 1.7 miles. Got to say it's like leaving a 3rd world country and walking into luxury. What a difference. The beach, the town and of course the pier itself were amazing.

Don't get me wrong, it's worth a visit however is pretty average.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IzzyIsmail
40,Great relaxing day out,The pier itself is great with the amusement park and plenty of restaurants to choose from. Even on a busy day it's possible to find a quite little area to yourself if you wish. Street musicians play all along the pier and there are plenty of little stalls offering souvenirs to take home. The walk along the beach from the pier is beautiful also with some stunning properties lining the beach. The 'beach gym' is also a great place to watch people learning new skills like slack lining etc,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amy270486

50,Great atmosphere,"Just simply a great place to visit. Iconic! The atmosphere was so peaceful and pleasant to experience. If you go to the LA/Santa Monica area, this is a must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bdnelson01
30,Disappointed,"Before I went to LA, I was advised to go to Santa Monica Pier. That it is a must see/experience.Was it just overhyped for me? Or was it really just not as great as people told me?Any tourist should still come here but once you get there it could be a little underwhelming.Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed this place. But I was really disappointed as it didn't give me the excitement that everyone gave me when they told me about this place.Beautiful pacific coast though. But you can see that all along PCH.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flipinny
40,Love It,"Great for a stroll amount the tourist tat and take in the sea air. The beaches are fabulous and the fun fair is, well, fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Binman62
50,Great activity,"We got an Uber out and had a wander around on a Thursday afternoon. We then walked down to Venice Beach that took about 20mins.Santa Monica is very clean and lots of shops before you get onto the pier. The pier itself has loads of side shows, buskers, rides and the restaurant at the end.Über from West Hollywood cost us $9 in a shared ride.Would be cool to go at night time when all the lights would be on the pier.Take cash & 1-2hours. We just wandered around in 20mins the left for Venice. But if you did rides and things would need longer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurajacksondavis
50,Pretty crazy and over the top,A visual overload at night but part of the fun of being so close. A must see just for the experience of a true boardwalk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moiraf160
30,"It's pretty cool, I guess.","Location, Location, Location. It does not get any better than the beaches in Santa Monica. However, this carnival could use an upgrade. The rides are fine for little kids, but even they get bored after a couple of hours of this place. I suggest going early when the park opens, but not at night time on the weekend, it is very crowded, unless of course, you like crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DamnRodgers
50,Would like to have stayed longed,"I went to Santa Monica Pier as part of a day trip to LA from Las Vegas. Thinking about it now it wasn't the greatest idea as we spent more time driving than we did actually walking around.Even though we didn't get to stay long we still had enough time to look around the souvenir shops, have a wander round the fairground and get something to eat. Was a little disappointed I didn't have enough time to eat in Bubba Gumps though as that's a favourite of mine.Considering it was obviously busy everything was clean and tidy which would make me want to return to take advantage of the lovely beach.The only downside is the parking but we were lucky enough to be dropped off but I think you would have had a long wait to find a space so probably advisable to get there early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HannahS78
50,Many different things to experience,Rather you spend time at the beach or at the pier you will be sure to have a good time. Parking is a bit expensive and a hassle otherwise we enjoyed it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F9965QMjessicag
40,Route 66,"We visited to signify the end of our Route 66 trip. Parking is $12 so expensive. The pier is nice for a quick walk. A lot of the shops on the pier are touristy.Santa Monica itself is very nice, the pier just seems a bit tacky",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TimBushell
30,No great shakes.,"Not horrible, but not much of an amusement park. Just a few rides, the usual fast food, an arcade, etc. Pleasant and clean. OK if your expectations aren't high.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmw12015
30,Super busy,"Stayed opposite the pier and gave up trying to get on it on a Saturday evening, it was heaving! Went back Sunday morning around 7.30 am it was lovely, hardly any crowds and the views are amazing. Just steer clear of all the Pokemon hunters!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasonwalker46
50,Great Attraction,The best time to visit the Pier is at night. Its pretty spectacular to see the pier come alive at night with the different lights. The area is a huge tourist attraction. Shopping and eating with a view of the ocean is unbeatable. Highly recommend. Drive around to find cheaper parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kdoug19
50,Summer sun,Lovely old fashion pier with a few places to buy a treat or two it gets VERY busy during the summer months but still a nice walk around.Beautiful at sunset.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christelmarial
40,Nice for a walk any time of day,This area is very touristy but has some charm thanks to the wooden pier. It offers nice views and foods any time of day or evening. Good for meeting people/ going out and also for pokemon hunting !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/107olivierf
50,route 66 end of the trail sign,"We walked along the sea front trail from Marina Del Rey to the Santa Monica pier to see the Route 66 sign and the end of the trail, which is actually sign posted on the pier itself.The beach and pier section of Santa Monica got very busy with visitors from all over the world. With all the bikes and cars parked up that have done the Route 66 tour all the way from Chicago.The pier has a show ground on it as well as people fishing and people entertaining the crowds.We even had our friend the sea lion waiting for us at the end of the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nippys
40,"Busy, Crowded and Very Touristy","This “Iconic Jewel” of the Pacific Coast still has its Ferris wheel, its Carousel, and the Pacific Park Amusement Rides. Visiting it last month brought back memories from 35 years ago when we came here for the first time.The place was jam-packed with tourists, street performers, and people glued to their phones collecting Pokemon. There were even more souvenir shops, food stands and people playing live music than we remember from last time.Still, the vibe is friendly, jolly and fun for young and old alike. This time we noticed the sign that states that “Route 66 Ends Here”, and naturally, we had to pose under it.The Ferris wheel provides a fabulous back-drop for pictures for one of the most visited places in this State. It is such a recognizable Pier, since it is seen in many movies and also on TV.For us, the place was too crowded, and the Beach was not clean, but the weather was warm, the views were outstanding, and the people all around us were super friendly. So we have no hesitation in recommending a visit, just for the fun of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheExplorerFamily
40,Good place to see some sights,We went on the pier and had funnel cake which was not really a funnel but was unite tasty for all the family. Best food and entertainment was just off the pier,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/706waynel
40,Old fashioned fun,Well worth a visit for a bit of nostalgia combined with some great views of the Pacific. The weekdays are quieter and the beach is really nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V1251SIjonathans
20,Run down and always packed,If you've never been there I guess it's worth going once just to say hey I went to Santa Monica but it's not really a big deal if you don't mind crowds then go it's crazy that you have to pay that much to park to really see nothing. GODISLOVE,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P3326KWmikeg
50,Amazing!,"This was our first time in California. We were there for a week. It was more so a Disneyland trip with other days sprinkled in between. The pier was beautiful. We didn't ride and of the rides, we played Pokemon GO and the PoGO scene there is crazy good! We enjoyed the beautiful beach, like it was beautiful. I am so in love with California now and specifically Santa Monica that I asked my husband if we could move there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LilMissTravelista
40,Great night.,After a meal has a stroll along the famous Santa Monica pier to find the route 66 start sign seeing as we were embarking on this trip. There was a chap in a kiosk who was very knowledgeable and very helpful. We loved the sights and my daughter did a couple of rides. Too many people doing this silly pokemon hunt thing which was ridiculous to see grown adults running around with their phone's . Definitely worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/snapperette
30,Crowded,"This tourist attraction is perfectly viewed from afar. I was there on a Saturday, so I'm sure it's extra busy on the weekends, but single file walking is not my thing. It reminded me of a typical weekend fair or carnival but with a much better view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissouriRDH
50,Weekend Excursion,"This was our first time to Santa Monica Pier, Great Garage parking close to the pier, the walk was a little much back up the ramp. Overall the experience was wonderful, watched the surfers off the pier, Volleyball games, especially liked the brazilian game were no hands can be used, that is talent. The theme park, has offerings for children , young adults and adults. Bubba Gumps shrimp restaurant was one of the dining establishments on the pier. The real disappointment was the aquarium not what we expected at all. A few fish tanks? in and out in less than 15 minutes. We stayed in Newport Beach, visiting Santa Monica pier was worth the drive. It is very crowded on a Saturday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goodguy5555
50,It's a must see if you are in California,"It's a must see if you come to California, the view and the sunsets are unbelievable, it's nice to take a ride down to the Pacific coast!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R7527XBclaudiam
40,Evening stroll,We went before sunset. Quite a busy place.Worth the visit if only to Brag that you have been there.Good for some nice holiday souvenir pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Merlioness
30,Nothing special.,Sadly the pier had no real attractiveness and nothing special to it. Some fast food restaurants and couple of rides.Wouldn't bother again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DJG1983
40,Kitschy but gun,"We don't have to go far to get to the pier from where we stay, so not sure how I'd rate it as a destination. It's basically a bunch of cheesy rides and shops overlooking the Pacific Ocean. You can get to the beach from here and there's a cute tiny aquarium and a nice carousel. What else is there to say? We rent bikes from a shop just behind the pier, on occasion, get a hot dog on a stick and a lemknade, etc. It's fun for an afternoon. And on weekends it's thronged if you're into people-watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlbanyTraveller44
30,An okay day,"We travelled into Santa Monica just after rush hour, we purposely avoided the week end as its too busy.We arrived around 10:30 am, no waiting to park, the pier wasn't crowded, strolled, shopped and enjoyed the view.We found it to be nothing more than a small theme park with an ocean view. Kids would love it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luanne226
50,It is good for what it is.,"I did not know that this was the historical end of Route 66!! Learnt something new, Paradise Pier has a little theme park, nothing but expensive if you do not buy the wrist band. Good for all ages. I bet it looks really nice at night when all the lights are one. The pier is as expected old and I got a few splinters in my feet even when I wearing my flip flops. The nails holding down the wooden battens jut out, so be careful as I tripped up on them a couple of times, also watch your phones as they will be lost forever if they fall between the gaps. We ate at the ""famous hotdog,"" place, nope!! They were horrible to taste and they take ages before your order is ready. It is fairly pricey here, the average t-shirt is around $30 plus tax. The views are amazing though, the actual beach was dirty, with hidden broken bottles, bottle caps and other rubbish, so wear some sort of footwear. We also did the redline tour of stars homes. Honestly, it is much better to take in the view of the coastline. I for one thought it was quite instrusive to drive right up to various famous people's homes and see if they were in, pointing out their actual address and what car they drove. I wasn't impressed personally. The pier and the beach stole the show. We took the expo line direct from 7th and metro, really easy direct line and cost a couple of dollars each way for us all. The metro stops literally a few hundred yards way from the beach. What more could you ask for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sasha138
50,Perfect!,"Santa Monica Pier is what dreams are made of. The vibe, culture, people, music, food, views...the list could go on! There is honestly nothing quite like Santa Monica Pier in the world!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bill_Ali95
40,Amusement Park right in Downtown Santa Monica,"It is almost a throwback to another era -- a classic amusement park on a pier located right in downtown Santa Monica. It has the classic amusement park rides, including a wonderful merry-go-round. Fun during the day and great at night when they turn on the lights. It is always crowded but everyone seemed to have a good time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelwM1280NT
30,Tacky isn't always a bad thing,"Like any other seaside pier, this has amusements arcades, tasteless souvenir shops and a pervading smell of fried food. Don't be put off though, because it's safe, interesting a window on life. Some of the live music played at the end of the pier was excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simoncG9073HE
30,Crowded,I advise the people who likes beaches to visit other beaches in los angeles city or in orange county .The third st near the santa monica pier is cool and alot of street musicians there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abdulameeda
40,Fun but busy tourist attraction...,"Visited in the peak of summer and had an absolutely fantastic time!The pier is an incredibly busy attraction and it took us over 10 mins just to walk down onto the pier because there was so many people about.It's a great site though, beautiful views and the Mexican restaurant at the end of the pier is incredible!Overall we spent a fun afternoon at the pier and enjoying the beaches surrounding. I would definitely visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SG1Lincoln40
30,Great as a backdrop,Fun to see and it provided a neat photo opportunity but really nothing else. And of course it's crowded with lots and lots of people. But the beach next to the pier is great!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdwardNLN
40,Fun in the sun,"The pier itself is free to visit. But, there are several things that cost money on the pier. We enjoyed people watching and looking at the views. There are plenty of shops and restaurants along the pier. It is a great place to hang out for an afternoon of fun in the sun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wtpoohb
40,Super fun day out.,"U could easily spend a few hours here. Lots of games, rides and food joints. The kids had the day wrist band, it's very worth it; u pay around 17USD and the kids can go and use any ride unlimited times. Great pictures here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/madamb2013
50,Santa Monica Pier,"Awesome place to hang out for the day with an array of activities - view out in the pier, play some games or go on rides at Pacific Park, cool off at the beach, good souvenir shopping and street entertainment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U8619ZOsandral
40,Nice,"It's kept in good condition, fun stuff to do for kids and has some restaurants.Highlight for us was the evening walk at sunset and in the night.Recommend to go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vikoj
50,"Beautiful spot, good food","My wife and I were biking down the beach, and we stopped at the pier to get lunch. It's a great place to walk around for a couple of hours. There are many food options from sit down restaurants to walk up burger joints. There's also an amusement park on the pier with a roller coaster, Ferris wheel, and some other games. Great view of the beach and the mountains surrounding the pier. Highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JNickel74
40,Nice for eveyone,If you have kids then they will totally enjoy the small amusement park there and if you are into shopping there are couple of stores there for souvenirs and beach wear. And if you are into photography then it's the perfect stop. I guess the place fits everybody,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AsmaZaher
40,Fun and Crazy Atmosphere,"I was thrilled to visit the iconic Santa Monica pier. It looks nothing like the scene in Forrest Gump although there is a Bubba Gump restaurant there.It was a Saturday evening when we visited, the peak of crowds and activities there. There was live music playing, an arcade, and tons of places to eat. But you get that at shore locations all over the place. What is cool here is to look over and see the glow of sunset to the north. I love the way a long boardwalk zone stretches out to sea instead of parallel to it.No trip to Santa Monica is complete without a visit to the Pier. It is the west coast equivalent to the Asbury Park Boardwalk with all the symbolic, historic, and cultural meaning both entail.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexanderD
40,Had to go!,"We had a fun few days here! The best bet is to get a wristband at the pier as the tickets to rides pricy. You have to go here if you are visiting LA with kids. So campy and they will love it. I feel you need to just adopt a SOCAL attitude and roll with whatever while here- weed, homelessness, lots of dogs, lots of sale pitches etc. But no one will really bug you. And if you give someone some food or water- why not? We loved it here. The beach was hot and the water refreshing. Overall a great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melissawJ5135YW
50,Fun stroll.,A fun stroll even when it looks crowded. Once you're on the pier you'll find it's not soooo crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardsC7805SY
40,Cool walkway,When a week ago. The pier is full of gift shops and places to eat but at high prices. We spent the morning there. A definitely beatyfull morning.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/diegolaass
40,Of Course You Have To See It,"My family and I came to Los Angeles 10 years ago and the Santa Monica Pier was one of our favorite memories. I wanted to bring my daughter back to see it now that she was a young adult. There is something so special about standing on that pier and seeing the beach below and the homes on the hill behind you. The pier itself can be crowded depending on the time of day, but is certainly worth the walk to the end just to catch a view of the coastline. If you like amusement parks, there is one right on the pier. We were not up for it this time, especially not when we saw a fairly long line to ride the ferris wheel. There were some great musicians playing on the pier, so make sure to stop and listen. Some have real talent and draw a crowd. Naturally, you must get a photo of yourself in front of the iconic Santa Monica Pier sign!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Donna224488
50,The Pacific Ocean!,The view of the ocean is breathtaking. Plus the walk along the pier is long and invigorating. Crab a coffee as its a bit chilly in winter but do walk right till the very end. On your way back stop at the restaurant called Baba Gump! Is got good food and quite fun for a forest Gump fan!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tincognitus
50,Good Times,Just a fun place to go enjoy sun and the sounds of the ocean. The little amusement park is so fun and the Peir offers decent food options. The energy is good and people are in good spirits. I love this place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrettyBrownNomad
40,love the vibe,coming from new York it's a different lifestyle. there was something about this pier that made it so different. go on the ferris 🎡 wheel . nice place to take pictures,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/94shirleyl
40,Great nostalgic trip to the coast,"Great summer feel good location, old school fair ground attractions and great views.Head to the beach front and enjoy the buskers, street vendors, local characters, food and bars to really make the most of your trip.Well worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Machram
30,Too many homeless,"Great place....but like all the great places, we always have peddlers and homeless drunks sleeping everywhere at any time of the day.It is California at its best.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaxA1178
40,Great views,We went to the pier for a quick lunch break before heading to observatory in LA. Bubba Gump at the start of the pier is a great option for lunch and very family friendly. Lovely views from the end of pier both over the sea and coastline. Parking right next to pier only $12 for the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrauEB
50,"Good mix of food, colors and ocean","We rented bikes from Venice beach and decided to walk the pier. Good break, many food and sitin options. Great location for iconic picture taking. At the end, view of ocean and cool breeze are just the thing to relax. Overall, great location for stroll",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZFoodieMSP

50,Not to be missed!,"I never do activities like this in my own home town, but in SoCal, this was a delightful experience. Many, many tourists and cheesy shops. But, absolutely worth the trip on your first visit to Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/acdhuber
50,Fun on the beach and pier,"Beautiful beach and not too crowded. we all headed straight into the water. First time in the Pacific and FHD temperature was amazing. Waves fairly strong, knocked you off your feet but great fun. A nice walk on the pier with lunch ended a fab trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/950francesr
40,Iconic pier,"Great for a few hours wandering. Iconic landmark. Lots to see live music, we saw a seal which was lovely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindarO3214KW
40,Nice morning cycle!,We rented 2 bikes for just over an hour and cycled from Venice to Santa Monica Pier and back. It was early morning and quiet (although alot of homeless around). It's a pleasant cycle and worth doing. The Pier itself is pretty and good for the photo opportunities. A nice way to see the Venice/Santa Monica beaches.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/An0nymou5
50,FAMILY FUN,"Great way to spend time with family, fun food & great place to Pokémon hunt :)I suggest parking in the beach lot and walking the quarter mile to the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/153carag
40,Scenic and atmospherix,Santa Monica pier did not disappoint. Great views and so many interesting characters! The rides area was well maintained.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elly_b300

There is a food kiosk right at the theme park entrance!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/asylumescapee
30,Beautiful tourist trap,"Went in the summer and it was incredibly crowded and full of tourists (including us!)The good restaurants were not on the pier, and the pier was filled with the usual touristy stuff. The beach itself was overcrowded.Worth briefly checking out - great views - but wouldn't spend much time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NewYorkTraveler7
50,Great time!,Visited Santa Monica Pier last week!Its beautiful. Not too many stores to get souvenirs but the ones they have I'm sure you'll find something! Ferris wheel is very nice too. Lots of entertainment,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aracely130
10,What a depressing dump,"For a British audience, this can best be compared to Barry Island or Blackpool. In short, a tacky, expensive dump. It is a beautiful stretch of coastline, totally spoiled by a massive parking lot and a tacky pier with amusements and rides. Sad. To quote Joni Mitchell, ""They paved Paradise to put up a parking lot.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FatWelshBloke
50,Nice Beach,Better beach than other beaches. Nice shops too... Evening time is good to spend there. Must see beach in Los Angeles,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pranavikav
40,It's nice for a days trip,"I come from Ohio, so this was a culture shock for me. The pier is nice, great view, a must see if your traveling and has everything you expect while traveling. Tons of people (don't plan on running or walking fast from about 10 am until about 10 pm) Don't try and drive and park, just take an Uber or taxi. Save your self the hassle. Everything is way over priced in my opinon, but that's a matter of opinion. We did not do the rides or arcade, but it reminds me of those pop up fairs that come to town :/ so not my cup of tea. The beach is nice and was clean while we were there!The only problem is the homeless and/or beggers around. It's something that shocked me coming to LA. I didn't know how bad it was. They sleep everywhere and anywhere so if your an early morning beach runner expect to see them on the beach sleeping. They are harmless it seems, just ignore them if they get loud and enjoy your trip :) it was something that shocked me though about the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lambert2230
40,"Fun for tourists, but parking and traffic are an issue",Can't beat a day on the pier...or night for that matter. Just make sure you park far enough away to avoid gridlock of downtown SM.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffN1329
50,Santa Monica hotspot,"Great way to spend a 14 hour layover at LAX. Quick ride (15 minutes) to the pier. Enjoyed several talented artists playing live music; a lively/happy atmosphere; ferris wheel overlooking the ocean, beach, pier; people watching....just so much to see and do. We were treated to playful sea lions flirting with the crowd then diving out of view. The ferris wheel offered beautiful views of the pier, mountains & ocean. Vendors politely great tourists with a variety of souvenir offerings. Even the police with surf boards strapped to their SUV were a fun photo op. Highly recommend a visit to gain a flair for this region.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/669christyt
50,Just as I imagined it.,"Santa Monica pier is so beautiful. Small booths where people are selling homemade stuff. A lot of carousels, specifically the ferris wheel is very famous and nice. Beautiful vibe and great people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariiabak
40,Very nice at nighttime - Crowded in summer,"The ferris wheel has gorgeous lights at night. Loved watching it. We visited in Aug 2016, so it was super packed! Parking wasn't good either, so we had to walk a long ways on empty stomachs. Restaurants were mostly booked, but luckily we found some food without a wait (Rusty's Surf Ranch). The rides looked very busy, but I do want to go back someday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melissadC2546BC

30,Fun,It's fun to visit here but parking is a pain and expensive. Also prices are high for things on pier. Fun to people watch and watch ocean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dem0502
30,Busy on weekends,"This place is packed on weekends and parking lots can get full....quick. We parked at the Sears lot when you first come in...which may or may not have been a good choice...its expensive ($25) compared to some of the other lots ($15)...but on the other hand, I didn't drive around for an hour trying to find a lot with an opening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/304StevenZ
50,Beautiful,This place is beautiful and very entertaining. Watching the sunset was probably the best part about the pier besides the Ferris wheel.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Newyorkbuddy5588
30,Second Class Honkytonk,"Santa Monica is an iconic jewel on the pacific coast of Los Angeles. CA.It's pier, on the beautiful and often visited waterfront deserves to bea place of entertainment, interest, and, at least, lasting memory.IT IS NOT. The few shops offer shallow, junk tourist fare. The slimdining offerings are lower than street carnival fare. The once proudCarousel, with live vintage Calliope, now has recorded music.Santa Monica can, and must do better!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drjohnsaddress

50,NIce afternoon,Visited from Wisconsin. People watching was fun. We also got to watch a seal swimming around the pier. Stopped for a beer and burger on the boardwalk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I2245ZFmarkc
50,Brings you back to your childhood!,"The Ferris wheel provided the most magical view of the coast line and the water. The pier itself had all the carnival games to compete for a prize from back in the day. Relaxing ride on the wheel, great photo ops. So many other rides to enjoy. Transforms you back to your youth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurieSue
30,Very crowded but good place to start a bay excursion,"The Pier itself was very busy on the day we visited. There is certainly plenty happening with rides, shops and food stalls of varying quality. I was a little underwhelmed but it was interesting to see and use as a starting point to walk along the wide expansive beaches to Venice beach and beyond. You can hire bikes from the pier and cover the area more quickly but we preferred to meander along and take in the sights and characters of the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/duncannj
50,Visit to the pier,"Had a lovely walk from Venice beach to Santa Monica beach/pier lots of things and people to watch ,people on bikes skateboards and roller blades families friends enjoying the lovely evening. Ended up on the pier where my friends went on the roller coaster I was happy to watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mdog13
50,Awesome Pokemon Go site!,"I went there in the evening just to check out the ocean view, it was packed with kids, especially teens playing Pokemon Go. I, of course, played as well and found a bunch of Pokemons I have not yet seen here in Boston.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pinacolada2017
30,Crowded but nice to see,"This is kind of a once you cross it off your list you don't go back. Nice to see it but extremely over crowded and kind of run down and trashy. Also, hang on to your kids .. One went missing while we were there. Easy to get lost in the chaos there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColetteK683
50,Assorrtment of Venues on Santa Monica Pier,"The first thing I saw was that 75% of the people on the pier were looking at their cell phones doing Pokeman Go! Bands played for tips, several seafood restaurants, carnival rides, and thousands of people on A Sunday afternoon. Don't forget to bring your kite(s) to fly on the beach. We flew 3.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanneP494
20,Did not enjoy this time...,"I had been here before and sort of enjoyed it first time round.. Second time round I wasn't distract by the lights and that I had seen this place on movies. This time around I saw all the homeless people begging for money, the rubbish and the fact it was overcrowded and expensive with lots of crap for sale! Won't be going back ever again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kozmohiggins
40,Childhood Nostalgia,"Debatably L.A.'s most notable landmark, although technically Santa Monica is a separate city. As a tour guide, it always pains me when folks want to drive up to the Hollywood sign ... a big waste of time. ""Huge!"" as Pretty Woman would say. More and more tourists are realizing Santa Monica is the place to be. Especially in summer when temperatures climb over a 100 degrees downtown and in the valley. Someone sang ""Nobody walks in L.A."" Wrong. I would advise you start at Wilshire Blvd. and 3rd street -- the north end of the Third Street Promenade and make your way 4 blocks south to Santa Monica Place. FYI the Promenade has some of the best street vendor performers, eateries and shopping. Santa Monica Place has all your high end retail, if you're into that and some awesome restaurants on the top level ... which now includes a new AMC dine-in movie theater. From there it's a short walk down to the pier where Forrest Gump turned around when he reached the west coast. The merry go ground will transport you back to your childhood as well as the iconic ferris wheel. It's also where Route 66 ends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/266PaulR
40,"Santa Monica Pier, the end for Route 66!","It is exactly at the pier in Santa Monica that Route 66 ends! There is a historical plaque that ends the Route 66 which begins in Chicago, IL. One of the most visited places in California, with restaurants, shops, a beautiful beach and the last original Route 66 Store for you to buy souvenirs! Unmissable!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/719cromero
40,Muscle beach great people watching,"We had a lot of fun walking around muscle beach and seeing people do some incredible yoga and exercising on the beach equipment. Great pedestrian space for walking.The pier itself is pretty touristy with restaurants and an amusement park. We walked over to another area in Santa Monica right near the pier and there were some very nice shops, musicians playing and restaurants. A little less intense than right on the pier. Very reasonable parking fees at lots right before the pier on Main Street ($3 on a Monday).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HBerke

40,It is what it is -,Santa Monica Pier is a great place if you enjoy crowds of people. I have been several times and the one thing that I try to do now is avoid the weekends! But this is a fun place to walk around and people watch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunni2014
50,Major Attraction,"It is always fun to stroll on the Santa Monica Pier at any time of the year, It is a perfect place to look at the waves, the scenery; to watch the people, the entertainers, people fishing off the pier, dogs, souvenir stands and shops, artist painting names on the grain of rice, taking a ride on many different available rides. Perfect picture spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rita20152015
30,Fun in an iconic setting,"It was great to take the family to this pier which is so easily recognizable from movies & tv. The rides and games are largely geared towards younger children, but we had fun on the roller coaster and enjoyed the view along the coastline.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlisonT806

50,The Journey,"Tulsa Time Day OneIt is 2:00 am in the city of Tulsa, Oklahoma and I know I am coming home. I fuel up the Mustang at the Quick Trip on South 49 West Avenue on the southwest side of Tulsa and I head out to the 44 freeway. It is still dark but that is just how I like it. I duck under the overpasses and pop out on the other side. The green sign says I-44W Oklahoma City with the arrow pointing left. https://www.google.com/maps/@36.0791165,-96.0492036,3a,75y,319.5h,82.42t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1srhqOIeXjR3yTHXg2W1785g!2e0!7i13312!8i6656Well I got to get going, the ramp is waiting. Like an airport runway the Mustang accelerates onto the freeway that quickly turns into Turner Turnpike and my speed picks up to 75 mph, Oklahoma City is on the horizon. Got to stop at the turnpike plaza near Stroud. I hand over a Lincoln and the worker hands me back a Washington. https://www.google.com/maps/@35.7712842,-96.6177653,3a,75y,242.43h,88.87t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1scoo76Og6th-9D7zVB808Bg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656Well the city is in the windshield so here we go.The OKC TransitHere we are at the end of the turnpike, I used those four Washington's pretty fast and I see yet another sign, I35S left lane, so here we go, by the way Def Leppard is on the stereo and its pumping fast. https://www.google.com/maps/@35.601128,-97.4158948,3a,75y,260.14h,94.81t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sOz63C-9x0XysSPu8tumyug!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 I slide on over for that little southbound push as the ramp is in sight. https://www.google.com/maps/@35.6000825,-97.4267076,3a,75y,298.83h,92.15t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s7dXyu333-34pIw_ZkNT29A!2e0!7i13312!8i6656.

El Reno, Hydro, Weatherford, Clinton, Elk City, Sayre, Erick, and the little stop called Texola is in the rear view.

I see the sun peeking out in the rear view and I see the Big Texan just down the way. Yes if you eat it in a hour with all the fixings its free or else you will soon regret it. The west Texas crossroads of the 27-40 is just down the freeway and alas I see yet another sign and it says I40W Albuquerque https://www.google.com/maps/@35.1925049,-101.8325089,3a,75y,268.68h,90t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s32lCDrAKmcSoHXDbYd3ZeA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 Well time to bid Amarillo a due and get down the freeway.Watering TucumcariHeading west out of Amarillo the west Texas towns are getting to be mere wide spots, damn why not 80 mph, well lets get going. I wonder how many coats of paint those Cadillac's have on them there at the ranch. Well I don't know but nevertheless. Bushland, Wildorado, Vega, Adrian, and the wide spot Glenrio are just a memory as the Land of Enchantment is in sight. https://www.google.com/maps/@35.1827595,-103.0425867,3a,75y,274.76h,89.3t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sYQfCGzbVDklLIhRbp1drmA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 San Jon is a blur out the windshield and I will be watering Tucumcari in 19 miles so lets get going. The pace picks up to 75 mph, by the way I changed the CD to Rush back in Amarillo and then some Doobie Brothers, nice dichotomy of artist. There is the 1st Street exit 332 just ahead, a Shell station with a Subway is my best bet, time to water down Tucumcari and head down the freeway. https://www.google.com/maps/@35.1535434,-103.7248844,3a,75y,48.27h,77.92t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sKPcnuMDco0cNITJ2oVqXeg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656Sleepless in AlbuquerqueBack on the 40 just west of Tucumcari the sign says Albuquerque 162 miles, 80 mph is my best bet, hopefully no New Mexico troopers are out prowling around. Santa Rosa, Clines Corners, Moriarty, Edgewood, and Sedillo were nice but the Super 8 on Lliff Road is looking pretty good right now, need a nap. The freeway begins to spread out to a couple of more lanes and I see the central New Mexico crossroads just ahead. The sign over the freeway says I40W Gallup Left 3 Lanes. https://www.google.com/maps/@35.106679,-106.6107773,3a,75y,287.85h,92.75t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sNlFAUTx2-TIc3zgx7AH0og!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 Yes another little slide to the left but this time its a gentle slide, not too bad so slide I go.

I merge onto the freeway and head west out of Albuquerque after a six hour nap and back on my pony. The early morning desert air sure smells sweet, it is almost intoxicating. Gallup 130 miles just ahead. Grants makes way to Milan, then I arrive at the point where the water flow splits at the Continental Divide 7225 feet above sea level. Gallup, what Gallup, it was a blur in the windshield, either way it was still dark outside so lights were the only thing I could see. Itching to get out of New Mexico and cross into Arizona I finally see the state line, https://www.google.com/maps/@35.3632538,-109.046604,3a,75y,217.4h,92.15t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sc2sc9zdCG410molR5Yt4Dw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656Houck, Sanders and Chambers, three tiny desert towns in eastern Arizona look like relics of the past as I continue on my westward push to Winslow. Holbrook, and Joseph City dot the Little Colorado River just to the south of the freeway. Winslow is just ahead around 20 miles so got to keep going. I begin seeing names like Jackrabbit and other western names that sound more like a John Wayne movie or Bonanza than anything else but its all good. As I approach Winslow the sun begins to peek out and cast its light on the desert floor. The desert looks like its on fire and I begin to feel free as an eagle in flight. Crossing over the Little Colorado I have Winslow in sight.The Florist of FlagstaffJust out of Winslow I got the Eagles in the player, yeah takin' it easy down this good old interstate I see Canyon Diablo, at this point in the journey creeks and streams are little more than desert washes waiting on the monsoons for a fill up. Its around 7:00 am or so and the air is still cool and crisp with a little bit of a haze build-up in the distance. Twin Arrows is peering just outside the windshield of my pony, you can tell it actually has two arrows at n old abandoned trading post https://www.google.com/maps/@35.1618253,-111.2795058,3a,60y,211.07h,82.69t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sO9ht62ObsYgpQHASmMXxRA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 but I don't have time to look at them too much, the pony has been in full gallop for a few hours since I left Albuquerque at 2 this morning, so I get going. Into the distance I see yet another sign but it is the most important sign of the journey, the first sign indicating Los Angeles is ahead. Just went over Padre Canyon, Walnut Canyon, and now approaching Flagstaff. Yes the sign, the most important sign, https://www.google.com/maps/@35.2179708,-111.5774631,3a,75y,252.76h,77.98t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1slrZkUYN2vg3KMjCgk6BaBQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 and I know I am truly on my way back home. I see Exit 198 Butler Avenue just ahead, I think I will give my pony a rest while I fuel up. So I duck in and see a Chevron and Country Host Cafe. The food there is pretty good for this weary traveler. https://www.google.com/maps/@35.1921443,-111.624423,3a,60y,204.78h,81.07t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s_hcYLlJgTu4tKHn6m-ISFQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 I get the pony all cleaned up, watered and do a check out and head on out.Needles StationHeading out of Flagstaff I see the northern Arizona crossroads of 40-17 just ahead.

As the pony leaves Seligman the road gets rugged and rocky but beautiful. I love the American southwest, its rugged but the most beautiful in the world to me.

The freeway begins its gentle swing to the right as I feel the final push. Yes I am beginning to catch whiffs of that familiar sweet Mojave desert air as the mile markers begin to count down. The final westward push has begun. Exit 9 AZ 95 is a blur, then Exit 2, its all downhill for there. For a moment I am thinking I am on planet Mars and the pony is the rover searching for substance in this vast desert. Hmm what do we have here, Exit 1 Golden Shores /Oatman, nice little western town but that will have to wait. https://www.google.com/maps/@34.7184438,-114.4732131,3a,59.8y,264.09h,90.77t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s6eEeGaf4HwZmhWDo3DGWJQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 With the water tower to the right and the natural gas/utility bridge to the left, the bridge approach is clearly in sight, yes the magic river, the Colorado, that lonesome snake that winds itself though this desert, and a supplier of life for the desert.

A bit farther down the freeway Kelbaker Road comes into view. The pony is in full gallop and not CHP in sight, good that is good. Yes good old Ludlow, just a wide spot in this vast desert but I'm not stopping there. Whats that, oh okay it was only Newberry Springs, wide spot, wide spot, wide spot. I'm beginning to look for some civilization at this point but finally I'm saved by Daggett. The Barstow-Daggett Airport looms off to the right. Finally seeing the exit numbers dwindle down. Exit 7 will buy you a whiskey in Daggett but I don't drink, then we see Exit 1, East Main Street, Barstow California, only 5,280 feet from the end of I40W. https://www.google.com/maps/@34.8856366,-116.9891765,3a,75y,269.93h,87.04t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sfaNUf9hDzEqAzvb8WEXzqg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 This freeway is winding down as it passes over the 15 and I see the very end as it passes under Muriel Drive overpass. https://www.google.com/maps/@34.8862786,-117.011602,3a,60y,267.85h,98.16t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s0BORW6Yvm6MAlSEq298whQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 I merge onto the 15 and bid the 40 a due, see ya in my rearview.

Getting past Hesperia I see the San Bernardino Mountains just in the distance. https://www.google.com/maps/@34.3446998,-117.4550532,3a,75y,244.7h,90.05t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sxpxkItBlTTOf_MNtf8EUsQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 Cajon wants to eat me but I won't let it, good tip here, center lane, 70 mph, and let it float down the pass, don't try to get cute or force it or you will pay 50 dollars everyday.

The wall on the S. Mills overpass tells me I am finally bidding San Bernardino County a due as I enter Claremont and Los Angeles County, finally I am back in my home county so lets keep pushing, push push push. The ""Stang is at full gallop and she ain't stopping now. I feel the rhythm of the freeway, I hear her song. Just past Fairplex and the 57 Freeway in Pomona the San Gabriel valley presents itself to me, I am a native of the Valley, Birthplace Monterey Park, my first home in Alhambra. As I descend into the Valley (tip 70 mph center lane and float all the way into Covina and West Covina and you will be fine). Just past the 605 I am getting into El Monte and then Rosemead. Just past there I find my cradle, Monterey Park on the left, Alhambra to my right. Back in my hometowns, but the pier is just a few minutes more down the road. Just ahead the 710 is in view. There is a back story to that freeway. There are talks in the works to connect the 710 to Long Beech Freeway extension just off the 210 in Pasadena up north via a tunnel, lots of digging there. I pop out the other side of the interchange jet under the two pedestrian walkways and just past the second walkway I see the sign I have been looking for since Flagstaff, Los Angeles City Limits https://www.google.com/maps/@34.0555969,-118.1955378,3a,40.5y,276.91h,80.87t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sBYW28393v3unYHk6h80-hQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 and her sky scrapers are in sight.

My 'Stang isn't quitting now, the 110 is in view as KLOS is belting out those all too familiar tunes, they have the Lep coming out of that 100,000 watt tower of power, To the right is downtown and the House that Kobe Built, nestled in the northeast corner of the interchange https://www.google.com/maps/@34.0364209,-118.269858,3a,85.7y,304.91h,95.08t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sVAHF748Xv5tv7ReV8f8D9A!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 The Lep is still pumping out of the 100,000 watt mega-house at KLOS, and I'm feeling pretty damn good about myself as I push west on the 10.

North on the 405 and you are in San Fernando, south you are heading to LAX, straight through and Santa Monica is straight ahead. https://www.google.com/maps/@34.0318182,-118.4146718,3a,75y,273.51h,90.37t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sZ7QU00k4F1cQHLhX0E1SAA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 The D.J's at KLOS are mad scientist of the radio world and always keeps the ticker going, I think its in the sauce, extra spicy I like it. There is a back story to the 405, the Angelinos called it Carmageddon. They shut down the freeway so they could work on the overpasses up around the Mulholland-Skiball area, H.O.V lanes are equally worthless but that is our friendly neighborhood CAL-TRANS for ya. Well lets go once again, gotta get past the 405 to the promise land. As I approach the Lincoln Boulevard overpass Exit 1A finally sews this dress up in a nice neat package as the 10 Freeway comes to it climatic conclusion. This 2,460.34 mile interstate has its beginnings in Jacksonville Florida at the 95-10 interchange west of the St. Johns River. This mighty interstate runs through the southern part of the United States. It runs through the states of Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California and one of the longest in the country. I have traveled through the states of Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and last but not certainly the least my home state of California. I've taken Interstates 44, 35, 40, 15, and the 10 to get to this point and now I am looking at the finish line right here. https://www.google.com/maps/@34.0151423,-118.4854993,3a,60y,226.88h,90t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sCyICvP444WxPiKfSewDLhQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656Doin' The S's Just Down The StreetAs I slide on over to the far right lane to 5th Street in merry ole Santa Monica the mad scientist at KLOS switches over to some Doobies and Steely Dan, the 'Stang begins to slow her gallop.

Hmm Sheryl Crow has a song with that in it. Find it on ITunes. Heading west on Santa Monica Boulevard the 'Stang slows to a nice relaxing walk as I look around for a bit. This is also getting to the end of Route 66. Route 66 west begins in Chicago on S. Michigan and E. Adams in front of The Art Institute of Chicago, and begins its westward trek through the states of Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California. It was the Mother Road. Large sections of the famous route have been restored, but others are still either taken up by our current interstate system or have fallen into terrible disrepair. As I keep on going further west on Route 66 (Santa Monica Boulevard), the 3rd Street Promenade looms large. Nice quaint shops and some more famous names are there. It is just like an outdoor walking mall, quintessentially southern California.https://www.google.com/maps/@34.015276,-118.4963267,3a,75y,204.5h,79.81t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sGgYEf8K0mAqmqAbu2uVs3Q!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 Further west Ocean Boulevard comes into view and just passed that the Mother of Us All is in full view.

40,Just like on tv,"Walked the beaches from Venice to the Santa Monica pier, lots of vendors and things to buy. The pier has a Ferris wheel and a small ""roller coaster"". There is a lot of dinning in the area so you have ur choice of what every u want. Weather was not too hot but beware on the hot days u will get burned. Great place to just take in the LA scene. Bring water of u decide to walk the whole beach and uber back. Parking is not a win win on this but uber is!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amiriashanel

50,Pokemon everywhere,I've always loved visiting the pier when in LA. It's a great spot to watch the sunset and is an all round fun place to be. Now there is Pokemon everywhere. This can be either annoying or awesome depending on whether you play Pokemon go or no.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alittlebitofskye

50,A really fun place to visit,"Beautiful beach! We went on the ferris wheel right at sunset, and it was absolutely spectacular! I guess during the summer, the pier offers free concerts on the weekends, and we went on one of those nights so it was full of people. The wait for a beer was ridiculous so we settled for roasted corn on a stick and churros (so good). They were handing out free boxed water and free snacks, too. Great place to people watch! We had a really fun time!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShinyShoes777

There is a carousel, lots of amusement park style games. A roller coaster , a Ferris wheel and more.Great places to eat like Bubba Gumps.Lots of junk food too like funnel cakes. Ice cream, dipping dots and pizza, burgers and hot dogs tooA must see if you come to Southern California. Perfect weather in August, warm and sunny and the water was great. The beach was full but not crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FamilyVacations702

40,Landmark Attraction,A fun place to visit and spend the day. The beach is beautiful and lots of room to stake out your territory. We always save our appetite for Bubba Gumps located on the pier when finishing up our day. Can be a fun day for the family but be aware that their is a homeless problem that you might want to prepare them for but plenty of rides and arcades and food and drinks to complement your trip,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grandbear6

30,Huge area and beach but lots of litter.,"I liked the idea of Santa Monica beach and the pier. The area was packed for a Monday. I thought the beach was pretty, but I was turned off by all the litter on the beach and in the water. The boardwalk and pier were packed and walking around was fun but slow. I didn't eat on the pier because the options looked just ok. It was a little cheesy for me. My kids loved it because everyone was playing Pokemon. We ended up going to the promenade nearby instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AZCMomof3
20,Very overwhelming during summer,"We have visited the pier before. This time, it was packed early in the day. Our teens made us leave due to the congestion. Didn't enjoy at all. We did however eat at the fabulous seafood restaurant outdoors. (The one that has Popeye by it) and their Poke and entire meal were fab. Also, cars were driving in midst of people walking as no one was managing the in and out traffic. It brought to mind some terrible person running through crowds, and we were all shocked at the congestion and lack of security or car vs persons supervision.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mwilder16
40,Nice to see people are still enjoying it here.,"We spent the day in Santa Monica and had to walk the old pier. It was jam packed with tourists and locals enjoying the food, rides and souvenir shops and stands. It brought back many memories of our younger days. If visiting in the area, it is a must stop by, but you don't have to plan a lot of time here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SrGrammyLinda
30,Good view of tourists,"If you want to see other tourists from the rest of the World and the US go and look If not, don't bother. Not much besides tourist stores, expensive fast food and people peddling caricatures and lettering( not very good but not expensive otherwise).You can gaze at the beach and other sun worshippers for only so much time.Essentially the only good thing( in my opinion) is the price. It's free!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jrael
50,Tradition,"Oh the tradition of going to the Pier. Its like returning to childhood with the walk along the pier. Ride the ferris wheel and more. This truly is a family place to be shared with the generations. It can seem commercialized with all the vendors, but it is a true Santa Monica experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jm717
40,Cool Pier,Parking is $20. It can get chilly during the night so bring a sweater if going at this time. Fun to see all the attractions - a fun carnival type atmosphere. Cool eateries such as Bubba Gump Shrimp. A fun place to visit - Three's Company fans!?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lm512014
30,Too crowded on weekend with too many Pokemon hunters,"So sad that the pier was packed with people just looking at their phones hunting Pokemon! Such lovely views and sunsets , activities and restaurants to see , but the majority seem too interested in looking at their screens. I would avoid on weekends and hope this craze dissapears. It is however if you can get passed the crowds it's worth a look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisJaneytravelling
40,Funky Old-Fashioned Fun,"We wondered what the constant river of people going out to and from the pier was all about. A local told us ""summer in Santa Monica."" That's what it was. No special event. Just people going out to walk the boardwalk and go back in time. Played skee-ball for the first time in years.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SATXKen
50,"Rides, junk food, souvenirs, in short everything a pier should have","I love roller coaster rides, tacky souvenir shops and junk food, so I was bound to love the pier. There's a good atmosphere, with lots of musicians and artists trying to make some extra money.There are various games where you can when a stuffed animal for your sweetheart, but I just ended up doing the roller coaster, which is slightly lame so you can take small kids as well. It was not very full, so the stuff let us have a second go for free, which indicates the fun, relaxed atmosphere.I did not see any healthy food options, so probably best to eat somewhere else and then get your after dinner fun here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LWSALB
40,The famous pier,"Well, this place is extremely crowdy, many activities and food available. Close to the city center and its many shops, restaurant, 3rd street ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xladvisor
20,"Very busy, quite seedy","We have a stopover in LAX and wanted to lap up a bit of atmosphere on the Sunday evening. I read reviews of Venice beach so avoided it and went to Santa Monica but it took nearly an hour to get there, once there was unbearably busy really rather unpleasant and quite dirty. There are probably some nice restaurants but to be honest we should have stayed at the airport! In hindsight I should have tried Santa Monica boulevard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/961lucindac
40,Great.,"Great place to walk, and eat. Beach not so clean. But that's a public beach for you. Night rides are great. Go eat at Bubba Gump!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/401anishaw

30,Spoilt by technology,"So I had a bucket list holiday with my family to California before my 60th birthday.I couldn't wait to see this iconic pier. When we arrived in Santa Monica the traffic was crazy. My son and daughter in law had been several times before and were astonished at the volume of traffic and people. We made our way to the pier. It was shocking. The amount of people bumping into me.We wondered was there an event that we were unaware of. We had to keep a good hold on our 5 year old granddaughter.It was impossible to get photographs or stop and take in the sights. Eventually we realised why...POKEMON...It was manic due to people looking at their phones and not where they were going or the incredible pier which they were on. It was shambolic. The only saving grace was that our 5 year old granddaughter went on the pier rides and her enjoyment was the making of the day. Otherwise the 11 hour air travel and 30 years of waiting was sadly spoilt.I like to think I'm a pretty young at heart woman but technology ruined my lifetime experience. I also mention that we made 2 attempts to visit Griffith observatory and for the same reason couldn't even park.I managed to get a silhouette of the pier in the dark from further away and that is the memory I will cherish. I didn't get to see the pier as I would have liked ,just masses of phones and wandering bodies oblivious to the history or beauty of this landmark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lelly57
40,Gotta See It Just Once!,"Located right next to downtown Santa Monica, the pier and all it's excitement is an icon of Southern California. This location is featured in many films and it is a great place to visit for an hour and have a bite to eat. We went on a weekday just before noon. Parking was easy to find and the pier was busy, but not overcrowded. A great place to just watch people!The cool breeze off the ocean was a welcome relief from the much higher inland temperatures. It allowed us to enjoy the outside more comfortably in mid summer. There is a huge beach there, if you want to spend the day, with nearby restroom facilities.There are many food options. We had a simple ice cream cone and a hot dog, and enjoyed them both.If you plan to fish, there are special areas for fishermen and women. I have not seen this at other piers, but it was a welcome site. There is also a bait shop on the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MinkHollowFarm
40,Bubba Gump,I had the pleasure of staying at Santa Monica the first night in LA and loved going down to the Pier to check it out..My friend and I had a walk on the beach and up to Venice with our first meal being at Bubba Gump #HappyDays,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X8576KCkimw
40,Standard Carnival/tourist trap,"It's worth a look if you have kids and/or you like a full time carnival. It has some rides (including a roller coaster) as well as salty fatty food options such as ice cream, hot dogs, funnel cakes, etc. Nice views. It does tend to get crowded so be prepared.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Retinol13
30,Dirty scruffy beach - pier lovely,"We visited Around 4pm so we could enjoy a walk on the beach and get a meal to watch sunset, we had a meal at bubba gumps which was fab with a great ocean view, afterwards we took a walk on the beach, to be honest it was somewhat disappointing it was dirty with mass amounts of rubbish ....The pier was lovely with a great atmosphere although as to be expect very busy st night time it looked fab with all the neon lights but wash awash with Pokemon people!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/190748JoF
30,It's a Pier...,"Quite a bit of tacky stuff going on, music, street performers, and lots of tourist shops. Having said that, it is a Pier! Small amusements section and the usual Ferris wheel style attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adsouza10
30,Day trip from downtown,Took the train from downtown to Santa Monica to visit the pier and eat. Walked about 4 blocks from station to the pier. The place was packed but average at best. It is a beautiful location but so is the park near the entrance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomdA9209ZR
40,fun day out,beautiful beach.lots to do.would recommend this area over Venice beach as more family friendly (less tramps and weed smoking),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicolet449
40,Fun place to visit,It is very unique to ride a roller coaster on a pier. The Ferris wheel will give you great views of the area. The merry-go-round is good for all ages. There are many restaurants with either grab and go food or sit down. The pier also has vendors selling . It is clean and safe and a fun place to be.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanR343
30,Overcrowded and over priced,The pier is nostalgic but the crowds are huge and everything was overpriced. Definitely a tourist trap. I'd suggest San Clemente pier or Huntington Beach Pier over Santa Monica,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joeyp60706
40,Nice views,Bit of a tourist trap but nice all the same.Great views of the ocean and surrounding beaches with plenty of shops and places to eat. Definitely a place not to miss when visiting!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dayno
30,Enjoy the beach,"Well, we are not really beach persons. But if you are, you will enjoy the waves, Sands and sun.Not beach person can enjoy the views and sun.This is where the first American highway end, Route 66. So be sure you have your photo taken at the Route 66 sign.After that, walk across to cool down, shop and food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertChew-MY
40,Great History,The pier is great. It has a lot of history for those who can remember the heydays. The ferris wheel is always great because of the location. The amusement park reminds us of what was before the super parks came on. A great way to relax and enjoy a day on the pier overlooking the ocean and the beach right there. The Original Muscle Beach was there and a sign is now there at the spot. Route 66 ended here. A must see on your travels. Many shops and restaurants nearby for everyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimK751
50,GREAT TIME!,We went on a Sunday evening after strolling the beach. We had funnel cakes and enjoyed the music on the pier. We did not have our kids with us but so much for kids to do there. This is definitely a great family place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/658valenciac
40,Saw this on a tour,We visited the pier while on a tour of LA. It was charming. I can't see spending more than an hour or two. It's Boardwalk entertainment and little shops with food mixed in. There are also a few rides but we were there before that opened. It was a nice visit to make.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/179cathleenh
50,"Lots to see, lots to do",If you stay at doubletree they offer all day passes for rides for less than 25.00 dollars. The weather is perfect now,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaypeewilli
40,Mainly for younger children,"A nice place to visit, rides and stalls aimed at younger children with some areas looking a bit outdated, we only spent about 45 minutes here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sailormoo
30,"Crowded, dated but still vibrant",A great place to visit once but probably would not go again as a bit crowded and the rides are dated. However it is an experience not to be missed if you ar in LA. Some reasonably priced eateries and of course if you a have travelled route 66 it is a must to get a photo of the end of route sign,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynda084
20,Been there done that,The actual pier is a to visit just to say that you visited ...the restaurants and bars in the area are the true attraction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/163jenw
50,A nice place to walk around,"Didn't try any of the restaurant but they seem alright and you have to visit at night, it looks amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Odeliaa2014
20,Nice area,Unfortunately because of work i did not get to experience more of the beach and during the day it was not busy. Would have loved to be there at the weekend or at night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maps582139
50,Family vacation,It's was for sure my best mini vacation ever.Walking town but if you want go to others place get a car so your stay will be perfect!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mzaza2014
50,A must do!!,We visited in August. A must do for any tourist!! Hustling and bustling with both tourists and locals. Very busy. Great food places and not too expensive. The rides were a bit pricey though.Great to just stroll along the pier and take in the atmosphere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HotspurUK
40,Fun,"Went about 11 in morning. Still plenty of parking. Lots to see and do, rides and games. Great for families. We sat on the beach with some breakfast and just soaked in the atmosphere. Loved it. will say i was surprised at how messy the beach was. Lots of litter such a shame. However we had a great morning there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fayred2
40,Sand on Monica,"I visited the Santa Monica pier in August to go swimming in the hot LA weather. The beach can fill up quickly so come early. The beach/sand area is massive (away from the water) so you will have lots of places to set up camp. Visit the Santa Monica pier for some food, people watching and a refreshing drink. There are many souvenir shops, arcades, ice cream shops, local crafts, the caricature artist, and the amusement park located right in the middle of the pier. It's a fun place to visit. The Boardwalk gets really crowded and almost uncomfortable so be prepared to navigate through a maze of sweaty, hot people. Bicycles are available to rent at Perry's (bike rental place) along with boogie boards. They (Perry's) also have lockers to store any belongings you don't want to carry around. A Convenient option if you don't feel like hauling around your backpack or if you don't want to bring any valuables to the beach. I thinks it's 5$ for the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rgd973
50,AMAZING,This is a must see destination. There is so much to do and see. This is only the first of many visits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/connies138

30,Crowdy beach,The place is beautiful but in order to park there every time we found it extremely diffucilt.And pier is super crowded all the time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rs243
50,Fun!!,"Lots of people watching, street performers and water. Throw in an old time amusement park complete with a ferris wheel and carousel and goods time are had.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sammymadison
10,Not much to do!,Traffic and parking a nightmare. Crappy food and cheesy merchandise. Very little to see and do there. Long walk from Venice Beach...big hassle.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/serenanf

50,i love it here,so much to do and the rides are fu n for anyone at any age also so many activities you can ride a bike so many food places and games,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/57sault
20,Thursday night on the pier,"This historic pier has been taken over by Pokemon thrill seekers! Our family of four including two teens aged 13 and 16 ventured onto the pier after taking about a 20 minute walk to get onto the pier from parking area. I couldn't believe how many people had their phones in their faces catching those creatures! They even had posted rules for safe playing of the game. The pier itself had beautiful old wood planks but not that much to entertain. There were a few rides and a few food stands. There was very minimal shopping. A few entertainers amused the onlookers. Overall, it was just another pier and not worth the time and money it took to park and walk onto the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/campbe
50,The End of the Route 66..,"Hi guys, I have been in Santa Monica during my last visit in LA. I think this is a fashion and enjoyable little city not far from crowded LA. Passing through the Santa Monica Pier is a great emotional thing because here finishes the Route 66 and this place is definitely romantic and simply unmissable...enjoy!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FabriGra
50,Great place to visit!,I used to walk or ride my bike to the pier quite often. It's a great place to enjoy the ocean breezes after a long walk or bike ride. The amusement park is cool and there are many restaurants including Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf with outdoor and shaded seating nearby.The carousal is a favorite and may be reserved for parties and there are many artisans and vendors as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I1061SNlb
10,Poor poor poor,Poor would not recommend . Too many homeless camped around . Too busy . Over rated . City over flowing with cars crime and homeless,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denzig
50,Classic Americana,"All the kitsch you want -- fair rides, greasy food, ice cream, vendors hawking services, musicians. Biggest beach I've ever seen. Good for adults and kids, but I'd definitely keep an eye on kids as there are homeless people all around. Police station on pier as well. We walked to the pier every night from our hotel for ice cream. Very fun. Good people watching place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/950DeborahC
50,Romantic walk,Romantic walk along the pier. Brings back childhood memories with lots of new attractions.Lots of places to eat or something to drink. We decided to come early before the crowd and relax. People watching is a fun thing to do too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1HotNama
30,Crowded and a sketchy crowd,"there is a lot of hype about this pier. The amusement park is OK, not too many rides. It is very crowded and the crowd was a bit on the sketchy side. We went at night and I was not too comfortable to have my family there. Maybe it is different during the day. all the restaurants were packed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jfidalg0
50,Must See Spot,"Santa Monica Pier is quintessential Los Angeles. If you are in the area a stop by the pier and the beach is a must do. The pier is a great spot for grabbing a casual bite to eat and enjoying the very talented street performers. The pier is a special place where every member of your family will find something to enjoy. A relaxing ride on the ferris wheel is a great opportunity to take in the views of the beach, coastline, and pier.My family stopped here for a few hours at the end of our Pacific Coast Highway adventure from San Francisco to Los Angeles and it was the perfect way to relax in true southern California fashion after a few days of driving. And don't miss the chance to enjoy sunset on the beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KaitlynF108
40,Cool evening out,Great sunset venue. Parking is scarce. Watch for Pokemon hunters.I have to type one hundred characters.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dgm458
10,Super mega crowded. Very tacky. Avoid,I can't see the attraction to a pier rammed with people and buskers. Blackpool pier is better. It's like the Kings new clothes...Nobody wants to say what a dump it is. Avoid.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marchmill
40,"Lots to do, great ambiance, huge crowds","If you don't mind crowds, you'll love the specific ambiance of the Santa Monica pier. We particularly love to sit at the end of the pier, enjoying the amazing views, while listening to an up and coming singer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuperZeeeeeeee
50,family fun,extremely crowded during summer! bring a jacket for night time as it gets cool! roller coaster is awesome - you go 2 times for price of 1 - Bubba Gump shrimp is good - pricey - long wait - put your name on the list and then walk up and down the pier while you wait!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angielesan
50,Good fun,Its a very busy place but lots of fun. The rides are expensive but well run.Lots of food and drinks available.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YorkshireSusie
40,It was a hot day,"Refer to my other review ""Crowded"" for the info....The other review is missing the photo of the savage seagull eating a pigeon, so expect the unexpected while visiting",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/823marthab
50,Must see,Must see. Exciting. We went for a taping of the voice and it was very exciting I highly recommend it. Make sure you build in enough time if you're doing a taping of the show,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joceph
30,Not really sure what all the fuss is about,"My kids have asked me and my wife to go to the pier. Frankly, I did not see anything worth a visit except for having a nice walk around first the pier itself and then the embankment. However, I can easily imagine the pier being converted into a very exciting place on the town holiday occasions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Evgeny69
30,"Iconic pier is, well, iconic.","I have not been to Santa Monica since a trip with a friend in 1992 and with a few hours to kill before traveling home early the next morning, I insisted to my 15 y.o. son that we should at least experience an LA-area beach before we left.We parked a few blocks up in a public garage for a few bucks (do NOT park at the extortionately priced lot at the Sears) and walked down to the pier. Even on a Monday evening, it was packed with a wide variety of people. Truth be told, it was a little run down, with a number of decent looking restaurants (we ended up eating at Big Dean's off of the pier - see my review), food stands, performers of varying talent and vendors of all sorts with a fun looking arcade (although it appeared a little beat up) and the amusement park, which looked, a. crowded, b. expensive, c. somewhat run down, but d. still fun.People were also fishing off of the end of the pier and the beaches on either side of it were expansive and impressive.While I am glad that we went (the beach really is that cool), there are so many other attractions in the LA area, that I simply cannot call this a ""can't miss"". If you go, go for the beach and enjoy the pier for what it is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/World17
30,People Watch on the Pier,Crowded Sunday visit - lots of talented artists to watch. Various carnival games for kids. Fun time for all ages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidpS7730SF
50,Great Place to Visit,"This is the first time I've been to Santa Monica pier and I recommend this attraction to anyone who is looking for something fun to do.There is plenty do to and it's definitely kid friendly. There's plenty of shopping for those of you who need retail therapy. Don't worry about going hungry because you'll see food vendors and restaurants along the pier. There's a small amusement park which includes a kid size rollercoaster and a Ferris wheel.If you're looking for a place to kill time, then do it at the Santa Monica pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RigiDig
50,Great place,A must visit when in Santa Monica. Great views of the coastline and ocean. Several shops and food places to visit as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/STEVEND265
40,"Fun place, gorgeous beach!","We had five teens with us and we all had fun! We walked along the beach and enjoyed watching all the people using the gymnastics area and the beach in general. Once upon the pier there was lots to see and shops to buy trinkets in. We rode in the Ferris wheel and roller coaster but having just come from Disneyland, it was just ok. Unfortunately for us, it was a free concert night with thousands of people one the beach and in a beer garden wiring for it to start. We would have enjoyed having dinner at the pier but it became just too busy. I would go back again and enjoy the beach a bit more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CSVanCity
50,Fun crowd,"Crowds aren't usually my thing, but everyone seems to be happy here - Great vibe! The street leading up to the pier is a nice walk, and the Pier itself is filled with lots to look at and do, great way to pass the time day or night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/indysparkle
50,Must see,If you come to Santa Monica you must go and experience the pier! We rode the coaster and Ferris wheel . Just seeing all the people .. Crazy fun,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarav837
50,Very busy,"Nice beach and pier but the parking can be a challenge if you go in the afternoon , we ended up parking about a mile from the pier and the parking shut at 8 pm which is a shame as the pier shuts around 10 pm",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NealH971
40,Crowded,It's fun to do it once.. Way too many people in the summer. Rides are expensive and so is the food. But if your in the area the pier should definetly be on the list,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brendabD7964AG
30,"Very busy, good todo but not outstanding","It is the second time we have been and it is what it says on the tin. A great way to get to look back at Santa Monica withe lots of attractions if you like that sort of thing. The Mexican Restaurant at the end of the pier is very good (we ate there last time) but on the weekend the whole pier is very, very busy. Good for Pokemon Go but follow the rules.Worth ticking off the list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coxyRC
30,Disappointing,"We found it to be rather tacky, with very limited activities, few dining options & cheap souvenir shops. Its' redeeming features are the beautiful views of the ocean & shoreline it provides and its' cooling sea breezes. There are other more attractive piers on the Southern California coast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/310Andy018
40,Favourite place to visit when in California,"I love visiting Santa Monica - more so just for the walk along the beach front with the cool houses then up onto the pier. The pier is little run down and the food available there isn't all that great. However for scenery and a beautiful sunset, its still one of my favourite places.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drumsndrums
50,Must see,This is a must see in LA. Full of life and iconic from the beach. Amusement park looked ok but did not try it. Easy parking nearby.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/682erikr
50,"Sea, sun and fun!","Listen, you have the Pacific ocean, stunningly beautiful weather, restaurants for every palate and lots to do - what's not to like? Santa Monica Pier attracts all kinds of folks from everywhere and they have one thing in common - fun! Smiles and laughter beneath the California sun - it's what makes Beach Boys songs!! You will not be bored!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RealPegster
30,A bit run down,"In the movies the pier looks amazing but in real life its a bit run down. Half the childrens rides where you put money into dont work, the rides are quite pricey and the actual pier on the weekend is overcrowded. Its ok for children and for adults the views are phenomenal as you look out over the sea and the beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/divacape
50,Fun place to visit..,So many things to so on this pier.. Next time we need to stop and eat at Albrights restaurant.. They were having bands on the pier..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scubaldy
50,Great for a cheap day out!,"My friends and I decided to go for a walk down the pier just to say we had been there and seen it. Its a lovely atmosphere, lots of street dancers and crowds. We went in the arcades and used the old fashioned photo booth which was fun too! Lovely views of California on the pier and beautiful beach at Santa Monica too. Lots of nice eating establishments within the area too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/543joh
50,Beautiful!,"Just a quick trip up this way before going to Buena Park and it was worth it. Parking is located right at the beach, but I didn't find it until after I already parked a little bit away. It wasn't a bad walk, there was a park area with a walkway along the beach area, which some picture-worthy memorials and cannons! The pier wasn't too crowded, but we were there during the middle of the day on a Tuesday. The souvenirs are a little pricey, glad I didn't pick up any of those little babies. We didn't check out any of the eateries this trip, but there is always next time! There is meter parking available, but if you plan to stay all day, just park right down on the beach area for 12 bucks. The rides on the pier were 30 bucks for ages 8 and up and 17 for those younger than 8, or somewhere along those price ranges.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosemaryANDsean
40,Lovely place and nice beach,"I wasn't expecting it to be so nice after other reviews but it really was. We parked in the multi level carpark a short walk from the pier first 90mins is free or you can park on pier for $12. Beach water was beautiful. Food, gifts and rides available on the pierThe wood on the pier is knobly/uneven so be careful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lelomufo
50,Good vibe,I really enjoyed my time at Santa Monica pier! There was a good buzz with lots of places to eat. It was a nice place to come for a stroll in the evening or during the day. It was always busy with lots of buzz.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joanne1592
20,Cheap Boardwalk,I had always heard about the Santa Monica Pier and I guess my expectations were way too high. It was crowded and had numerous sales carts. Parking in the area was expensive and hard to find. A couple carnival style rides and food booths but nothing special. Save the parking fees and just drive by.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G7333LPbarbaras
40,Stroll along the pier,A must see in Santa Monica - ride the solar powered ferris wheel and stroll along the pier. Nice to hear the buskers playing live music and great views of the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Russ066099
50,Great views,WOW! A must see in Santa Monica! great views super restaurants and always entering watching the street performances.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C8848HFmikes

30,Commercial and crowded,"Comming from the UK, we have alot of seaside piers, and Santa Monica Pier is no different to any of those, except the sun shines here!! It's free to enter, though parking is $10 or $2 for 2hr in designated places. There is a large funfair that takes up most of the pier (I didn't use it so don't know how much rides were but it seemed popular) and a fishing deck at the far end. Near the start is a Route 66 sign post stating end of R66 so that is quite crowded with people taking photographs. Other than that, it's just a pier that could be anywhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S1890WMsusanw
30,"Crowded, just alright","Not bad to visit if you happen to be nearby in the area, but I would not recommend it to go out of your way to visit this place.Alot of the games required at least 3 or 4 players, so if you just happen to be visiting as 2 people group, you're out of luck.We ride the roller coaster and it was quite fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/badwolflibrarian
50,Great for couple of hours,"Loved this trip, extremely busy in July, enjoyed the sidewalk entertainment such as Nat King Cole artiste. Even spotted the odd sea lion being fed at the end of the pier. Car park huge and looked full, didn't attempt to park so close. Parked in one of the many private car parks in nearby Santa Monica Boulevard. Worth the visit . Great fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janetfitton2
40,Love the retro feel of the games arcade!,Such a lovely stroll as the sun starts to set. Too busy in peak times as to be expected and getting a table at a restaurant is tough but the nearby food trucks provide a far more fun experience anyways. The games arcade took my partner back to his youth playing Pacman and Gallagher! Fun spot and something for everyone!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzr1977
30,Fun time,"This place is pretty cool. Personally, I feel that it's a bit over run by tourism attractions at this point. Still a fun event, make sure to check out the jumbo swings along the south side of the pier!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcosv341
30,More for kids!,"I myself am a big kid and it takes very little to excite me, the thought of the Pier really had my hopes up but I was a little deflated. Having been an avid GTA 5 player I simply assumed the pier wouldn't be as basic as it is on the game however there actually wasn't much more to it. Perfect for the younger kids just doesn't appeal to us big kids as much. Definitely worth the visit to enjoy the atmosphere and you don't have to pay entry or go on any of the rides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kerryb463
40,Nice views and atmosphere,"My only disappointment was that there were no venders selling seafood. The food was also overpriced. Still, it's a nice day out with plenty of entertainment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saraearle
50,Best Pier of California,When you talk about Pier is always a difficult choice . I end my game Santa Cruz vs Santa Monica but the second one won . I don't know why it is special for me !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fabioborsoi
50,Beautiful,Clean and quaint - it was like visiting the nicest seaside town in the UK but with perfect weather and blue sea. What a wonderful day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisonhadley
40,Nice place to visit in the afternoon,This place is nice to visit when staying in LA. There are many restaurants and things to do down at the pier and the highlight for the kids is of course the amusement park. There are also many restaurants and shops on the opposite side of the street from the pier. I can highly recommend to visit this place in the afternoon/evening to walk around have something to eat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joky80
40,Colorful!,"We really enjoyed it! The atmosphere and the vibe was really nice! There are many small shops, places to eat and some rides as well. It's family friendly!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tobyduran
50,"2nd visit, just as fun, always pleasant.","I drove my family to the pier for their first visit.Everyone loved it. My nephews rode the West Coaster which they enjoyed very much. Though we had limited time, limiting interaction at the venues, enjoying the weather and free entertainment, while watching someone catch fish is good if you've got to run.The pier is overall clean, family friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/almightySR
30,Iconic beginning or end of historic Route 66.,"A visit to the iconic Santa Monica Pier is a must for out of town visitors. There's a dozen or so rides (buy the multi ride wristband to save money) with the roller coaster and the Ferris wheel the most popular. The view of the So. Cal coast from atop the Ferris wheel is great, as is the view of Santa Monica. The carousel at the beginning of the pier is a must and was used in the movie The Sting. Enjoy the salty air as you stroll down the pier, with hundreds of other tourists. Here's an inside tip: along the boardwalk just under the pier a few hundred feet south is the original Hot Dog on a Stick. Its a little red free-standing building. It's not as neat and clean as the subsequent franchises, but have your pic taken in front of the stand that started it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X5749RHjimm
30,Beautiful sunset...very crowded,"We went to the pier on a Thursday in August, which was a concert series night for the summer, and that can explain the crowds. There are also lots of bikers that are a bit rude if you're in their lane accidentally.The pier is small but a great place to watch the sunset. It's a bit expensive for rides (each is $8). However, you can buy a ride band for $29.99. Which seemed a bit much for us, a family of four.Also, there is a parking lot next to the pier for $20. But, drive up a few more blocks and there's one for $3, if you mind the walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/winedn
50,Good vibes!,"Spent the afternoon on the beach and then walked salons the pier. Such a great atmosphere! We enjoyed some icy lemonades and soaked up all the good vibes that surround the is area. Full of shops, takeaway foods & fun for all the family. Everyone is just so happy here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SballNewry
30,Very touristy and packed to the gills with people playing Pokemon Go,It was difficult to enjoy the Pier when we visited around 10pm on a Sunday night. It was so crowded but mostly with people staring at their phones and bumping into everyone as they played Pokemon Go.The restaurants and shops looked fun but we couldn't get inside any of them due to the crowds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Menotis
40,Very busy,A nice place to visit but very busy. Had a lovely vegeburger on the pier. Great photo opportunities and good views. Old style fairground activities.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jubilee-jo
30,Charming but packed!,"The quintessential boardwalk, lots of rides, food and characters, but oh so crowded. Perhaps if Pokemon Go wasn't so popular, it wouldn't have been so packed. Great Poke-hunting",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/calimom10
50,Gorgeous!,"Beautiful place for a nice, scenic stroll. It does get quite busy but that's the charm of it. Very lively atmosphere and there's even a little carnival/amusement park on the pier called Pacific Park. Go for a spin on their ferris wheel and enjoy an aerial view of Santa Monica!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MySuitcaseJourneys
40,Fun under the sun,We had so much fun the food was great the peer was full of vender and rides it was fun the beach was full of people,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/manuelmI9824ZF
50,Excellent,"I wasn't sure if this would just be another Venice Beach but it isn't. A much friendlier and happier vibe, I thought.The pier is full of things - rides, things to eat and everything you'd expect. Nice views back towards the beach. Definitely worth some time when you've had enough of the sand..!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H9412VIsteves
40,"Crowded, but beautiful",The scenery at the Santa Monica pier is great! A great for pictures and to just relax after a long day. It does get slightly annoying with the huge crowd but it is well worth the visit. There are also great places to eat close by.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ExpSid15
50,History,Love the pier and visited in August and my 2nd visit. Athmosphere is amazing and a must have photo opportunity under the end of the route 66 sign,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulH80
20,"Dated, old, extremley crowded and not much to do.",The pier is nice in the morning when it is first opening. Then later is becomes too crowded. Has nice views but not much else tempted me. Is outdated and nothing special about it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/906joanned
30,A step back in time,"The bright bulbs and carnival atmosphere allows a visitor to step back in time, although sadly these places battle to compete with modern day theme park attractions. Still the pier is fun to visit if nothing else but to people watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NauticalVoyager
50,Fair on the Jetty,"Loved visiting here have not been to a place like it, a place of fun where adults and families can visit together with rides and restaurants all on a pier. A couple of places that stood out were the end of Route 66 and Bubba Gump Shrimp.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/torz70
50,Nice walk,"Beautiful view to take anyone who wants to see California, can be very busy packed with people, view is worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/959sanaf
40,Good Times,"Loved this place,would go back tomorrow if i could.Just interesting to see how american beach goers live and this is a prime example.I think from memory there was a Ruby's Diner at the end of the pier which is where i ate somegreat american diner food like Chilli Cheese Fries",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blackboys2015
30,Tick it off your list...,"Santa Monica beach is stunning! The white sand goes for what seems to be forever.As for the pier - meh. It's something to do and see and then leave and go somewhere better for food that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.It's nice to walk to the end of the pier, take some photos from the end, enjoy the buskers....or not (all seemed to be singing about Jesus!!) and never go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nat0716
40,Always fun with kids,"My daughter and boyfriend asked me to take them somewhere. I was done with work so we took off to the pier. We only live about 30 minutes away and it was his only his second time going there. They had a great time we got hot dogs from Japadog that they both liked and walked around. Always something to see around the pier. It is one of the things you have to do when visiting from out of the area. But even if you are a ""Local"" it can be fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/814daned
20,Too many people on a pier,"At night it is beautiful with all the lights. But packed, you cant move and there is not that much to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nybobby
30,CrowdEd and a bit dirty,Fun to play in the arcade but VERY hot and a bit dirty. Quite touristy and definitely no place worth eating at. Good people watching!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheryle2013
50,Beautiful part of the world,"This was not our first visit here and wont be our last. The pier can get a bit busy during the middle of the day so i recommend going early, straight after breakfast if your wanting to get good photos without the crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jodie6106
30,Worth a stroll,"Visiting Santa Monica with my 13-year-old daughter and her friend, we did the obligatory stroll on the pier.Worth doing, if only for the photo opp.Seaside tacky done as well as anywhere, with gorgeous views of the beach, mountains and waterfront.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timr211
40,Kid Fun with Ocean Breeze and View,"Gotta ride that ferris wheel for the view. The roller coaster is pretty basic, but fun enough for the 10 and under crowd. I'd say the sweet spot for kids between the ages of 4-10, but there is stuff for younger and older, too. Still plenty of teens running around, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/844jasonw
30,Cool if you're in the area,"There are some little rides, a ferris wheel, an arcade, small vendors, and people with assorted talents",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VodouGza
40,"Interesting place, parking is impossible.",There is plenty to do here with the rides and street performers. My daughter pointed out that it looked just like GTA(a video game she plays). There are also several restaurants to eat at including a Bubba Gumps Shrimp Co. I gave four stars because it is very crowded and parking is poorly managed. It took us an hour to get to the parking lot.(Suggest coming up through the neighborhood on the south rather than off of Pacific Coast Highway to the north.) There are several homeless people and the stench of pot hangs in the air.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DesertProwler
50,Iconic,"Visiting Santa Monica Pier was a really fun experience. Strolling over the thick wooden boards felt like walking in an old school movie. In the morning it was still quiet, in the evening it got really crowded but that was also due to a free summer concert on the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AVDM81
50,Nice day to spend,"Quite nice place to spend one day. You can relax, fish, and spend a whole day. Nice atmosphere and good set up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heshamseada
50,A classic pier,This is a great pier. It is big with plenty of places to chill and take it all in. It can be very busy. There are places to take in the view or you can enjoy the carnival atmosphere of the funfair. Good place to spend an evening.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Centrepunch
30,Amazing place but wasted opportinity,It is exactly as it looks on movies. Feels like a lost opportunity though for tourists. Still gotta see it as Sheryl Crow sings......nothing like Santa Monica boulevard. Takes 10 mins to do it all,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FionaS33
40,Crazy busy but good sunset photo opp,Went on a Tuesday night in August and was amazed by the number of people in the center of the pier which is where the rides and restaurant was located. I did not feel 100% walking thru the large and high density crowd. Instead we left the pier and walked on the beach and saw an amazing sunset and took lots of great pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/235danp
30,Iconic pit-stop,"If your here you should decently go, if only to walk the pier and see the sights. I brought the kids and managed to get them off the pier without spending too much money, we did buy some fresh fruit to share. Took some pictures and then went onto the next thing, it was a nice little detour for the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minotguy
40,Proposed here last week,"I came here on the night on August 4th 2016. It was night so couldn't see much of the beach. There was some kind of concert on the beach so it was very very very crowded. Was hard to find parking, when I did find parking it cost $25 for 2hrs. I believe the person performing was Natalia LaFourcade based on the website. But I wasn't there for that, that was just coincidence. Walked the pier, looked at the shops and rides, proposed on the beach and went to celebrate :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maine3k2
50,Straight out of grease! Just lovely,This is everything you want in a pier without the tacky elements. Enjoy the views on the Ferris wheel and eating ice cream. Knocks socks off Venice beach!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natsprat80
50,Great place to watch the sun go down,"We always like to visit the pier for a walk and sit and watch the sun go down over the Pacific. There are a few decent fast food places to get a snack and just relax and watch the sunset.Other than parking, which isn't too expensive, this is a free attraction which is well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FullFonz
40,Enjoyable Nights on the water,I spent a few nights during my business trip on the Santa Monica Pier. There is always live music and acts to enjoy. The best time to be on the pier is during the sunset—it is incredible!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/724dane
40,Fun but crowded,"We went for lunch and had a great time. We took our two children (8 and 5) to ride the rides and play the games. To be honest, we had a fun time, but it was pretty short lived. I would suggest you bring your children if they are younger and maybe not looking for a wild rollercoaster. My daughter is an 8 year old ride enthusiast and she got pretty bored after about 45 minutes. Good luck!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marionation1
40,Summer Concert Nights!,"Summer concert nights at Santa Monica Pier are great and free. Every Thursday throughout the summer, the pier hosts music concerts beginning at 7pm lasting to 10pm. Family friendly environment There is plenty of security on and off the pier and staff guiding pedestrian traffic. It does get busy so if large crowds are not your thing, might be better to stay away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gbby0223
30,Nice view but nothing unforgettable,"Except from the nice view offered from Santa Monica there is nothing unforgettable. If not too crowded you could have a nice walk on the wood deck, and get a nice view of the coast.I went there mid-July and it was crowded with hundreds of people playing Pokemon go... That didn't help to really appreciate the atmosphere I guess. Nevertheless it was not the best place I visited in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephe-regi
40,Nice stroll,"Walk on the beach or jump in the waves, or just walk the pier and enjoy a nice Mexican diner at Mar y Sol. There are rides here for the kiddos to enjoy. Fishing is always a possibility too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pparmen
30,"Crazy crowded, very tacky.","Perhaps the SMP is one of those bucket list places everyone should experience once, but we failed to see the charm. It was packed on an August Saturday to the point of being almost impossible to navigate around tour groups, honking cars, skateboards and bikes. While the views and people watching are superb, we were glad to get out of there after 15 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/43reds
30,Just like Blackpool!,"So lovely sea view, friendly people busy seen nice shopping around Santa Monica but very busy! And we went on a Sunday.You can catch to bus but bring a jacket for the evening the temperature really drops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DreamJetsetter
50,Great fun,Lovely afternoon spent on the pier. Great views and plenty of shops and stalls. The beach is lovely aswell.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/860marie
30,Crowds and Filthy,"To be fair, I hate crowds and we visited on a Saturday afternoon. There was wall to wall people on the pier and the beach. The beach was filthy with trash and one individual who decided to deficate in public. It made my skin crawl to even walk on that beach. The view is beautiful but for me, thats about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dpeshl
40,Just do it!,Something you just have to do. Walk along the various artists and performers and enjoy the view on the sea and beach. Buy some tickets for the rides and then jump on your bike again to continue your bicycle ride on the fantastic beach trail.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pablo2504
40,A great beach with lots to do.,"Very busy on a July Friday afternoon, but still a great place to visit!Plenty of great shopping and restaurants. Lots of beach and ocean to choose from. The pier is full of rides and carnival food like funnel cakes and lemonade. The pier even has a Ferris Wheel:)You could easily spend a a day or two here:)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephaniedW6694JC
50,Manic,"This place is exceptionally busy and over rated. It offers a poor roller coaster, a ferris wheel and other fair ground attractions. The place was heaving with very few places where this let up.I guess if your staying in santa monica it's a must, however wouldn't travel to it especially.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardEssexUK
40,Happening Place,"Loved the atmosphere at Santa Monica Pier, we had gone at night, and it was very lively, couldn't get on the beach but the pier itself had so much to do. The mini amusement park. Lots of restaurants to eat, and the roadside entertainment. People playing music, etc",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/huz152
40,Sunset wow,"Its crowded, lots of noise, plenty of places to eat and drink some OK Bubba Gump for example. But the sunsets are to die for, really the best we have ever seen. If you can come just for them",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carlyb284
50,Amazinh,You can't visit Santa Monica and not go on the Pier!. It is bustling with activity and amazing at night when illuminated.. Try the wheel as views across the beach are just beautiful. Tickets are priced but worth it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cordy3-11
40,A nice experience for travellers.,A nice experience for anybody travelling to Los Angeles! Visited the pier for the second time today and again both me and my partner enjoyed the experience. Lots of entertainment and things to do. If your looking to eat at one of the restaurants on the pier then be prepared to wait. Apart from that great experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carmchanbrahar
40,Great family place,"Amazing place. Full of peaople. If you don't like pokemon spillers, stay away. They are everywhere. Otherwise the caroussel and the restaurants are great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fiftop
50,Wish we spent more time there!,"My daughters and I went at night and had dinner at Bubba Gump Shrimp Co., we walked around the pier and enjoyed the sound of the ocean, something we do not have where we currently live. The atmosphere was fun and safe. I hope to go again next year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luisana619
40,Baywatch ahoy,It was great to see where they filmed Baywatch and get some photos on the beach. The pier is great and is the end of Route 66 which is another attraction of the place. If you get nice weather it's a beautiful beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ferryfo
30,Great place to walk!,It was nice to see so many people enjoying the beach. The rides were busy and the lines moved fast. It is a good place to go for a walk and people watching. A few restaurants were interesting to visit but there was a long waiting time. $12 for parking at the pier's parking lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/texmex12
50,Very cool place,"There is a lot to do in the area ! The rides are gentle ! People are nice ! You can find cheap souvenir t-shirts . There are all kinds of food options (sit down restaurants also) they have a lot of activities around , surfing , volleyball, gymnastic bars , biking and jogging trail which goes on forever ! I went from Santa Monica to Venice beach and could have gone further . There are so many people here !!!!! We could not believe we found short term parking 2 hours in a tiny lot . The beach is very wide ! Water is cold ! This was the best place to watch the sunset !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellegD9641HQ
30,Insanely busy!,"If you like crowds, lots of crowds then you will like this place otherwise stay away....far away! Too busy for my liking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FirstClass001

Make sure to bring sun screen and a umbrella for those sunny days!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/muggle-traveller
20,Too crowded,"My wife and I visited the pier on a Thursday night. We could not believe how many people were there. We chose Thursday instead of Friday because we thought it would be less crowded. Everywhere we wanted to eat was over an hour wait time, even a little tamale stand. I know that people feel okay to smoke outside, but there were too many people smoking and it was unpleasant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/572brennanw
40,Pokemon Central,"Went cause the kids wanted to collect Pokemon. Apparently this is the Mecca for Pokemon, everybody is on the phone collecting them. Apparently there are some rather rare ones here. I would not know as we sat and ate food while the kids Pokemoned. So if you have teens they will want to go here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlbalTrvl
40,A Quick Stop for Boys,"Boys wanted to see and visit Santa Monica Pier. Since we are from East Coast and visiting Vegas, we decided on an overnight road trip to LA. A must do of you have time. Staying in Vegas is perfect for visiting LA/San Diego for a day. Concert at pier evening we were ther. Free...able to our feet in Pacific and spend time on pier. It was nice to visit. Having a bit more time would be good, or get there earlier. Parking was crazy due to concert event.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Boyz4Us
50,Great Visit,"Have to walk the Pier at least once during your stay in Santa Monica as its iconic. Lots of people strolling along, their is an amusement park, aquarium, stores, and food. Can fish off the pier. It is beautiful and great views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J0hnPM10
50,Nice View,This pier is always very packed but it's nice to visit with family went there with some buddies of mine. California weather is great all year long. Got on a roller coaster not very scary but hey it's ok.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobmanly2000
30,Not much to do,"We arrived pretty early in the day, weather was nice and not crowded; but really not much to do;our highlight was watching the seal in the ocean.we returned back in the evening and it was packed; go early if you like to get a spot for parking right next to it for $12 flat rate",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BoardingPassBabe
30,Too Busy In Summer And Parking Difficult And Expensive,"Interesting to see once and then best to be admired from a distance. Santa Monica is a difficult place to park as it is always so busy. It takes so long to navigate the streets and sometimes drives you to just give up. Once parked and there, it is entertaining and interesting to people watch",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AucklandWiz
50,Beautiful and Vibrant Place to spend,"This was my 5th visit to this awesome place. I liked to spend more times here while I visited LA. This place is a must on my visiting list. Not only as interesting place to shop, but it might be a vibrant place to enjoy, especially near dawn. Great views at sunset. As the end of well-known Route 66 this place is able to act as one of the most famous spot to visit in America. Great!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JCFave
50,You have to go.,"Its the end of Route 66. And its a huge Pokemon stop , if you are into that. The whole area is a great place to walk and take pictures.As you are going back to the street, keep right, and behind the ferris wheel, there are stairs to the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sailtaal
10,Depressing and Terrible,"We visited the Santa Monica Pier and were shocked. It is essentially a hotspot for homeless people - and nothing else.The place was filthy and was full of intimidating people, all intoxicated, doing some pretty disgusting things in plain view of the public.It's not for tourists to speculate on the socioeconomic issues that have led to the homeless crisis here but I urge anyone with a young family to stay away from this place as it is nothing more than dangerous.It's a shame because it's clearly an iconic place but it's been left to wallow by the city and is unsafe as a result.Stay away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TWheeler4286
50,Part of our summer vacation,We went to the beach and the park we had an AMAZING time!! The Ocean was so pretty but really cold!! My daughter age 8 and niece age 17 and my fiancé made memories and had a great time!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agreen408
30,"Meh, very crowded and touristy. Not my thing.","We walked the pier on a Saturday evening and it was very crowded. It seemed very touristy and wasn't my thing. I hear they have a nice carousel and the view from the Ferris Wheel is supposed to be great, but we didn't do either. I don't plan on going back to the pier if I can help it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Runnerjb
50,Love the place!!!,You enjoy the beach and you have a wonderful time with your family and friends and you can take excellent picts from the place!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YanaraSosa
30,"Peir amusment, nastalgia keeps the rating up","First off, you must really like nostalgic peirs or Hollywood history to even consider this a valid stop. Also, make sure your wallet has 4 times the amount of cash you expect to spend.The arcade I'd fun, and a historic road of my childhood. The rides are a half assed carnival attempt, but the atmosphere is fun and conceivably nostalgic.You can have fun here and create memories, but know what you're getting into.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mweaver27
40,Interesting to see,"Family of 5 visited for a couple of hours. Quite lively, the amusement area is full of screaming kids and the rides were fairly pricey, about $8 each. Different food options and little vending carts with shopping items and some live entertainment. 1 1/2 hours free parking in a multi story parking lot about two blocks straight up from the pier entrance. Nice looking beach area with paved bike bath and great ocean views with parking there too. Not sure of price. Waves didn't look overly high in this area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisan670
50,Last stop on Route 66,You have to go for that reason alone. Beautiful views and fun attractions and several food choices! Route 66 last stop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keyaj2014
40,Nice To See Once,"It's a good place to visit once, but I don't think it's worth going back to since there are many more places to visit in the area",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Riz29
30,Crazy Busy,Gotta stop even if busy. Walked the pier and rose the Ferris wheel which was really cool. Definitely a place for younger kids as they have games and rides. Overpriced parking at hotels that advertise public parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahmK469SS
30,Vibrant and fun,"I've been going to the Santa Monica Pier for over 45 years and it's always interesting. The people watching alone is worth the stroll, and you should stop in to see the old merry go round. Although it's changed so much over the years and is much more of a tourist destination these days, it's still a great place to hang out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bubuflu
30,to busy at all times,it looks nice form the distance but once on the Pier; only hords of people. and during our visits hord with a mobile phone searching for Pokemon Go,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DutchWassenaar
30,"Nice place, but super crowded","It's an overcrowded, tourist trap site. However, it's still iconic. There're stores throughout the pier and a little theme park. The beach is fine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PattaHector112
40,Must See!!,This is a must see attraction. Lots to do there and enjoyable environment. The only negative is the traffic getting there. Take the exit before and go up the PCH to get there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gatorsoftballdad
50,The life,"At a time when I needed a motivation. Fun, many different cultures, and near water. Son was also excited to meet ppl and laugh all day. He needed to be away to get ready for his life battle. He loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/430gener

40,"A concentrated place for fun, eat and views.","Santa Monica pier is a perfect place for the first timer. There is some rides for the kids, snacks/drinks and a way to get a good look at the ocean life. Some days you can watch surfers doing their thing just below.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petertQ604YM
50,Very crowded.,The pier was full on a Wednesday evening. I am sure it is partially due to the pokemon go craze and everyone trying to catch them all. Amusement park rides at the end of the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/9gaila
40,Nice old school day out,"Has lots of restaurants, right next to the beach, and some fair rides with old school ring toss and basket games",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/779katien

30,Not clean,It's good to go and see but like all of L.A. That I saw it is filthy and full of rubbish. Look closely at the beach and there is rubbish everywhere and also what is with the amount of homeless people everywhere.i come from London so am used to city's but L.A. In general is a dump! Sidewalks are always filthy and rubbish just everywhere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/r0biati
40,Nice Pier; Nice Beach,"We were in San Diego for three days, and we're spending two in LA before heading to the Bay Area for the final days of vacation the traffic in LA was awful during late morning on a Monday, and it took a long time to finally get to Santa Monica. We opted for public parking in a garage off Fourth, which was convenient and inexpensive.We didn't spend much time on the way-too-crowded pier, but we were on the beach for a few hours. It was great.I can't imagine how crowded this area must be during more popular times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatM402
50,West coast adventure,Great entertainment for all ages. We bought the pass online to save a few bucks and got to the pier around 10 pm to ride the rides in the dark and see the city skyline. It was a Friday night and we waited about 30 minutes for the roller coaster and none of the other rides had long lines.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebbieD555
50,Weather was nice!,"If you can't get a flavor for CA at this pier, then you just don't know homeless people like you think!Most are quiet, it's the rare ""F U"" shouting while they are walking down the boardwalk that bring out the true flavor of the beach.Stop for a hand drawn selfie at any one of over 10 ""artists"" waiting to draw you. Don't want a drawing? There are 5 more artists that are willing to draw your name in the color of your choice!Takes me back to Michael Douglas in ""Falling Down"" complete with the guy who needs a ride/gas money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonC1743
50,Beautiful,Crowded yet still room to walk around and enjoy the beautiful scenery. We went early morning and parked close by. Not much really to do unless you ride the coasters and just people watch. Great areas to take scenic pics.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaffireSky
40,Nice place,"One of places to visit when you are in LA.Beaches are nice, and pier is very cool.Nice place to go in couple or with family and kids",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vishay88
30,Touristy,Slammed with people all day and night. It was nice to see it but it wasn't for me. I think if I had kids it would be helpful to occupy some time. But very clean and comfortable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F859JRjuliel
30,Cool place to see!,"Very very busy attraction. Was cool to see because its famous and historical. But it's very crowded. Plan a lot of time to get through traffic (2 hours from Pasadena to Santa Monica), we valet parked at the Shore Hotel which is a cool place by the way, but it was $38 dollars a day, as we walked down to pier we saw beach parking for $12 a day lol. We visited the pier, had lunch a tasty lunch at Bubba Gump Seafood ($70 and 1 hour wait), bought mats, umbrellas, beach toys, sunscreen and water bottles ($68), then hung on the beach until the beautiful sunset. It was very crowded and there was lots of loud rap and Mexican music playing. Large camps of people set up and some left trash behind. A few homeless sleeping on the beach, and lots of pigeons. Wasn't quite the relaxing beach I envisioned but we made the best of it and had fun playing frisbee and taking pics of the sunset. I probably would choose a different beach next time when I'm looking for relaxation and quiet and less crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaS20

Wide expansive space, lots of LA bodies showing off their physique and a cute pier with old school rides and an amusement arcade.It was a fly by visit for us but I wished we'd had longer to really take it all in. Great Zoltar fortune telling machine (same as the one in the film 'Big' in the arcade :) )",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Impa88
10,Crowded carnival atmosphere,Not a favorite of large crowds and cheap thrills. It felt like We were visiting a road side carnival but instead was a sea side carnival.

50,Great Experience!,I highly recommend going all the way to the end of the pier...enjoy the sights while enjoying a nice sit down lunch!

20,Disappointed!,Not sure why everyone likes this place. We went in the evening and it was trashy and overcrowded. Maybe my expectations were to high. We have been to some much better beaches with great piers. I couldn't believe the amount of trash at this place. Please hire people to pick it up. Will never go back! So disappointed!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tkb2124
40,Must visit!,"Don't leave Santa Monica without visiting the Pier. If offers a great young outdoor vibe. In the afternoons and weekends can get very crowded so go early if you want to avoid that.

Definitely worthwhile!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ajbalbo
20,Overcrowded and not worth the time,"The walk to the pier was awesome, but once we got to crossing the bridge to the pier, it was nuts! The place is way too crowded.

I would definitely not come back to the pier, but Santa Monica is still a beautiful place to stay and visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luv2Travel_HY
50,One of my favorite places,We have been here twice and it is one of my favorite places ever! The food is incredible at bubba bumps and the pier is something from a movie! Easter is cold and waves are swift but very enjoyable!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessAndrews001

There are some really good buskers down there that kept everyone entertained. The beach is really beautiful. They have a carnival there that is lots of fun and some nice eateries there as well. We tried the Mexican restaurant at the end of the pier which was not too bad. They will sell you an umbrella at the beach but we chose to hire a bike and take the ride to Venice beach which is good fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Curtkezza

40,It was quite interesting at night.,"We visited on our way back from San Francisco. It was about 7 PM and just starting to get dark. It was the perfect time of day to go. The beach was just clearing out, so there are plenty of places to park, and the pier was filling up with people. If you are looking for a great place to eat, I don't think I would head there. But if you're looking for someplace cool to hang out, check out the sites and the lights and walk along the beach, it is your to go to place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/behavinit

30,It's what you'd expect.,"It's a pier. It's the ""end of the line"" for route 66. It's an amusement park. There's lots to do, little shops, the beach is pretty nice. Things on the pier itself are a bit pricy as to be expected. If you took children (and $$ to spend) I'm assuming it would be a great family outing. For bigger kids, unless you're into rides there's not much to the pier. A fun quick stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RachaelVW

30,Good Place for Kids of All Ages,I'm over amusement parks (unless there is a superb roller coaster) but this is on the pier with lots of fresh air and the backdrop is the Blue Pacific Ocean. Win win!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dn303
50,A must see,"Very beautiful and very fun.

But this time itvwas so crowded with thousands of Pokemon hunters that it was no fun at all.I went back the following morning at 7am for a morning walk and it was much much better!!So ... A morning beach walk with visit to the Pier is the thing to do till the pokemon hype is over ...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carlvanloey
30,Something to do,My family had a decent time here. Unfortunately we all felt like he pier was too short. They should try to add to it. We spent $12 on parking but walked the pier in just 1/2 hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeanninaa

40,Fun for the family,"this place is a family place. it has game rooms, roller coasters , bumper cars and nice restaurants to eat at. It was one of the highlights of our trip. We enjoyed the arcade , and it wasnt over priced.If you are going to do the rides, buy the wrist bands, unless you are going to let your kids only do one ride. The band is defiantly worth it.The peir itself is free to go on , the rides and games are not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ddubdub11
40,Iconic!,"Enjoyed our visit to the pier, but was very very busy. The rides and side shows are quite pricey. We went up the big wheel which gives a brilliant view of the pier and the beach ($20 for 4 of us...)

50,America at its best,"Lovely surrounding with oceans and most beautiful, crowded beaches and activities you ever seen.The pier boardwalk is one of most lovely and family friendly places in whole LA. There is plenty of domestic restaurants: shrimp or beef. Every 10 m there is street artists singing or dancing, entertaining the crowd. There is famous amusement park with attractions for whole family. Wether you visit the pier in the noon or late in the evening there will be a lots to see and do. Plenty of restaurants, amusement and souvenir shops. Get yourself a Route 66 sign on its very end destination, or grab a small surfing board when you already are there. You can park your car on the pier or some of huge parking areas surrounding beaches and pier. Parking on the beach parking costs about 15 $ or 18 $ on the pier- flat rate.You need to know that whole area is very crowded and located by couple of major highways so you will be waiting. Add this to your plans.But when you are there you will have a great experience whether you choose a budget or some more expensive visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/21nenadj

40,Fun but crazy crowded,"Visited here with my 14-year old daughter on a very hot Sunday afternoon in July. It was WAY too crowded. I've been before at night, when it's lots of fun because it's all lit up. It's like a mini-boardwalk. There are vendors selling trinkets, buskers singing for donations, ice cream shops, and a great little amusement park (which you can see on the picture). We did have fun, even though it was crowded. You can also fish off the pier, although I have absolutely no interest in that!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Imamom604

There were some long lines for food and rides but it all kind of Blends in with the atmosphere. My date and I had a fantastic time. Lots of fun being had by everyone singles, couples, and groups. Gives a very nostalgic feel. The pier is located right over the beach and has easy access. I made the walk over from 3rd Street Promenade and it's only a couple of blocks. I love visiting there whenever I'm in the Los Angeles area. It's also the end of historic Route 66.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fredsplayland
50,Iconic attraction. It'll already look familiar because you've seen it in countless movies and TV shows!,"Fun to browse. The kids will like the rides. And the whole family (or couples) will appreciate the ferris wheel at sunset....the lights, the sky, the ocean, the vista...the whole package:) The kids will appreciate the carousal on the other end of the pier as well, and the adults it's history! The history of the pier itself is very interesting...too long a story for here but you might want to google it:)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robynm124

40,Great place to hangout.,Fun easy place to hangout or visit as a tourist. The rides are kind of old and the arcade games are old but it's a great view and it's easy. The Farris wheel is an awesome view of the city and every Thursday in the summer they have free concerts that are really fun. You sit in the sand to watch the concerts and you can bring wine to drink if you keep it low key.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y6287LAstevek
40,Nice afternoon,"Decided to visit Santa Monica pier for the afternoon. We parked at the promenade Wenger the first 90 minutes are free. Or afternoon parking cost less than $5.00. We ate lunch at the mall and then walked down to the pier. There were some street performers along the way. The pier itself has some pretty uneven boards, so be careful not to trip or roll your ankle. We rode the ferris wheel (8.00 per person) and called it a day. Fun, but not something is do very often.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RPVTravelmore

Brilliant place my brother lives here and wouldn't change it for the world second visit planned already for next year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amycQ2044MR
30,Ordinary peer with a chance to see seals.,Nothing special really. A bunch of takeaway restaurants and some rides.I though it will be more special for being LA but nothing to envy Brighton' pier in the UK.The good thing is that if you are lucky you may see some seals,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/258patriziag
30,Fun place to visit,We visited for the day via metro line from Hollywood. We rented segways in Santa Monica which was a lot of fun. We stayed on a bike path that took us to Venice beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kathy_Wanamaker
40,Nice walk and view,"We were hanging there and had some lunch all together. The view is spectacular, rides are cute (didnt take any) and it is possible to have some souvenirs.Take a lot of photos cuz scenery is breathtaking. But, it might be windy so be prepared.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ygritte85
10,Heat of Summer=Mega Crowds/Trash,"Went on a Sunday and yes, it was crowded. Parking was a major disaster with narrow spaces. Gridlock in and out. Pier was crowded like they were giving away free stuff, and the beach looked like a landfill. Suggest going away from pier, but if you have to go - be prepared!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/califmac
50,Beach place,"This is an amazing pier and the beach is awesome. However, if you want to rest and relax while you are at the beach this is not the right place to be because it is quite crowded",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lvcardoso
50,Great atmosphere,Loved it. Great atmosphere. Good place to watch sun go down. Queues for big wheel very long so didn't do it. Probably not much point at night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandacE1861TB
50,Relaxing vacay,Santa Monica is a wonderful and relaxing place to vacation. Whether you just want to chill and relax on the beach or venture into the LA city attractions it offers both options. Would definitely recommend for families with older children who are able to do a lot of walking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ray12217
50,Must Visit,This is a great place to visit and walk around. There are many interesting shops and interesting people performing on the pier. The view at the end of the pier is fantastic,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eric00012014
50,Santa Monica Pier- California,"It was super busy, but worth the trip. We lucked into a parking space which cost $12 for 3 hours. The only downside to the beach was it smelled of seaweed and the Pacific Ocean was extremely cold. Lots of free entertainment of random singers for tips only. I spoke to an artist who drew caricatures- he said he would draw our picture (two of us) for tips from $10- my shoes; he would take anything offered. I saw a man who sold key chains for 1 for $6.99 or 2 for $10.00. The food and drinks were exceedingly expensive. The people were friendly. They had a park on the beach for children and an exercise place which resembled an American Ninja Warrior workout camp. You could rent many different types of bikes such as a regular bike, the ones which have a chair for a seat, tandem for two, 3 wheeled stand up bikes which they had manual and motorized. There were at least 8-10 rides mostly for children with the exception of the roller coaster and Ferris wheel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/673marnier
30,Tourist area with lots of people waiting to do something...,"If you want to just walk the pier it is good people watching BUT if you are planning on eating, etc. don't bother. It is crowded and made for tourist. It is fun though to see all the street performers and novelty items. Don't expect an upscale experience this is the West's version of Coney Island...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dawnwtv
50,Peaceful but crowded,"If you like the beach, but just watch it then a pier is the best for you.This pier has a lot of things in it, first bubba bump and a Mexican restaurant at the end of it also the fast food chains near the little amusement park. A LOT of street singer and homeless and of course tourist making their way through the pier. At the end of it, it is less crowded and you can appreciate the ocean in its entirety.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulaaB2116CW
30,"Glad we went, but underwhelmed","I'm glad we visited this iconic locale, but I was underwhelmed. I thought there would be more rides and things to do. Plus, the ones that were there were super expensive to ride -- $16 for two people to have one ride on the ferris wheel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/252ering
50,summer fun!,"We were in California for a Disney Land vacation. We had a few extra days in California that we kept ""plan free"" so we could find things to do. We bought wristbands and rode everything a few times. We had fun. Loved the view from the ferris wheel!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimberlyhh2015
30,Took a walk but it was too packed,"After dinner, my wife and I took a walk onto the pier with some of her co-workers. The pier was nice and had a lot to off such as rides, food and entertainment but was too packed. We went in the early evening too so I'm not sure the best time to go would be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RDavis227
50,A Santa Monica icon.,"The pier is probably the best known feature of Santa Monica, and it's well worth a visit. It's always crowded, but it is a fun place to explore. To park, you can either drive down the ramp to the pier and park in the lot immediately next to the pier, or you can park in one of the many lots around Santa Monica and walk down to the pier. The pier provides a great view of the beach, the coast line, and the surrounding mountains. It has the look and feel of an old-fashioned carnival, which is a big part of its charm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ERFSU82
50,"Lots of Lots of performers, bluest water, nice walkperformers, bluest water, nice walk","Santa Monica pier was very nice. There were lots of things to see and do. They had lots of performers to entertain you, vendors, food, and amusement rides. It was very crowded on a Friday but a nice place to visit if you are near LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gh427
30,Worth a look,We were in Santa Monica for a day as part of our travels north and decided to explore the beach and pier.It's definitely worth a look as it is supposedly the end of Route 66.A few places to eat and some great views of the coast and just nice to chill out for a while.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/605mikec
50,Love this pier,I love this pier. It is a large pier always filled with people and excitement. The views from the pier to the mountains and then down the coast to other beaches is just gorgeous.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mhantis
50,Always Enjoyable!,"We've visited the Santa Monica Pier many times when we have vacationed in L.A. You can park below the pier if it's not too crowded, however we like to park at nearby Santa Monica Place and walk over (about two blocks away). Note that you can only park in the Santa Monica Place ramp for a maximum of 3 hours, so if you plan to stay longer, you'll need to park at the pier or try to find some street parking, which will involve a walk. Another possibility is to park at Venice Beach and rent a bicycle to ride over to the pier. (Bikes can be walked on the pier, but not rode.) We always ride the ferris wheel, so we can take pictures of the area. Great views! The ferris wheel admission is about $8/person, so is not cheap. It's a great place to watch street performers, shop for souvenirs, grab a bite, or just walk and look. Always an inviting place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cynsha
40,One of the most iconic Piers in the world,This is an amazing care as it is been here for so many years. It is been used in many movies so. They have concerts during the summertime on Thursday nights. If you're in the Santa Monica beach area it's definitely the place to visit. You could take the metro rail down to fourth street and walk a few blocks to the pier. This place is definitely worth a visit!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C4564IKrichardl
40,Worth a visit!,"We really enjoyed the Santa Monica Pier. We were there for about 2 hours, but we did not hang out on the beach. We parked at a hotel that was nearby and walked to the pier. We paid $20 to park, but we probably could have found cheaper parking. There is a lot by the pier, but I recommend getting there early because I think it filled up by early afternoon. We ate Pier Burger, and it was really good...and affordable. It was fun walking on the pier and looking in the little shops. I did take off my shoes and get in the water. There was a little amusement park there that was about $5/ride or $20 for an all day bracelet. We did not do the amusement park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KLP211
40,Not much time needed,Crazy busy environment. Lots of kid rides but expensive. Great views of the beach.. But tons of people on pier.. The usual pier foods and shopping. A must see spot but doesn't need much time out of your trip,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J9260DPjamiec
50,So fashion place,"This place is very nice to relax, enjoy the view and having a beer talking with friends. Spetacular place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Viviangom
40,Fun for the whole family!,"Had a lot of fun, but bring your wallet. Do not go to the arcade, 2 out of the 3 games we played did not work and lost our money. The Ferris wheel is a must for great photo of the whole beach. All in all a very fun trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jdressel1
30,Nice,It's alot of people want to see crazy people or people who perform so come hereIt's not like Venice Beach. There is amusement park aswell,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nanapiesie
50,Old School Pier Fun!,My kids loved this place packed with games and rides and lots of junk food. Great restaurants to choose from and shops along the way. Parking can be a bit difficult during the heavy times but once you get there it's great!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vaca555
30,Nice if you like crowds,It is very hard to move because there are so many people walking very slowly while looking at their phones.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferwP3463RG
10,Been there - done it,Crazy busy - too many people - nice to say we have been there but that is it. Shopping in the Promenade was good and so were drinks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieB290
50,A fun family afternoon while travelling PCH.,"We parked the car in the main car park beside the pier. It costs $15. The pier is the official end of Route 66. It's very busy but was nice to walk on to the very end. There are lots of stalls and outlets selling food, ice cream and souvenirs. Also plenty of toilets. I would recommend going on the Ferris Wheel, the views of this enormous beach are incredible and you can see over the city too. We never stood in queues for long for anything, not even ladies toilets! We watched a cheeky seal catching the fish as the fishermen threw them back into the water. Then we wandered down onto the beach and spent the rest of the day there. Make sure to find the gymnastic park near the pier and hire bikes too. Got some great photos!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Falkirkdolly
40,Great place for an hour,I enjoyed the hustle and bustle. I'm sure I would have stayed longer if the kids had come along. The beach is great. Lots of families splashing about.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annacX3035BJ
30,Very touristy,"One of those things you should see while you are in Santa Monica but not one of the highlights of the place. Tourist trap. Ride the Ferris wheel, hot dog from Japadog",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Helena6040
30,An attraction with real history.,"We visited on Memorial Day, so the crowds were thick. From the carnival foods to eat, the rides to enjoy and the people to watch, the Pier is a slice of all-Americana. There is even an indoor carousel, so if the weather turns bad, you can retreat indoors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/972jennym
50,A must see,"This was a great stop for us while visiting LA for the first time with children. The restaurants and the beachfront were very crowded but not unmanageable. Only one complaint, the bicycle/umbrella etc rental shop on the pier was blasting really inappropriate music. No one else seemed bothered. I took our kids out while my husband completed a rental - no other options within walking distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haydenhw1
40,Nice view from top of hill,"Walked down from Hill above to pier. Nice view,and pleasant walk.Plenty of people at different ages enjoying the area. Beach and pier well attended. Plenty to see and do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zbestbiker
10,Too crowded and nothing to see,"We visited the beach and pier with family. What I love about the beach is how expansive it is. There is an incredible distance between the water and where the sand ends (i.e. Road, parking lot, etc) so there is plenty of space to run around and play. Now, we were there in May when it was still a bit cool (I'm from Florida so I get cold when it dips below 75). There were a lot of people! The pier was miserable because all you did was dodge people the entire time due to how crowded it was. There isn't anything special to see there so just skip it and stay on the beach. There were some fun street shows just off the pier though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natalieb515
40,End of Route 66,This icon pier at Santa Monica is the end of the famous Route 66.Its very tourist but the again what seaside pier isn't.Nothing great in terms of food.Lots of rides and tourist shops,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djhallett
50,Don't leave Santa Monica without coming here,"Yes, it's very very crowded, but well worth going. Once you get on the pier, the crowds spread out and it's not terrible. There's plenty to do - amusement rides and games, dining, snacks, people watch, and of course look out over the beautiful ocean. Tip: don't park on the pier - park elsewhere and walk to it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorig689
50,A definite place to visit!,"I absolutely loved visiting the pier. First of all, the views are amazing. During the day it is great to be near the water, but the sunsets toward night time are a must see. Going here with family and small kids is a great idea with the amusement park rides! So much to offer here with the games too.Also, if you're looking for a place to eat, there was a great Mexican restaurant at the end. I recommend this to all in the area! Any amount of time here is well spent!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SToews
50,Such a lovely place to visit,"I have such fond memories of this place, from when I originally visited when I was a kid. To come back this year, brought all those memories flooding back. The pier itself I don't actually rate all too highly. It's the beach directly next to it that's perfect.You get a perfect view of the pier, and the ocean, and of Santa Monica behind you. The conditions are perfect, everything's right with the world. Visit Santa Monica Pier for that feeling.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacknoon12
50,Pier was touristy,"We ate here- pizza was about $40 for 3 people, overpriced. Ice cream was also overpriced but good. The Ferris wheel was my favorite part. Kids loved all the pokestops more than anything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/972LizC
50,Very special place,"The Pier is a must visit, to see the iconic Ferris wheel. The views are amazing, and the beach is lovely just below. There are lots of good quality restaurants along the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W-LJ92
40,Overrun by Pokemon Go,"I have been here a few times and it is a beautiful pier, however there must have been thousands of Pokemon Go players standing around on their phones, we were playing our own game of dodge the Pokemaniacs and it was quite fun. I always recommend taking a stroll down the Pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andrewkol
50,NOT TO BE MISSED WHEN VISITING L.A.,"The Famous Santa Monica Pier is one of those sights that should not be missed, especially for those travelers who land in LAX from across the Pacific eg China, Australia, New Zealand , Japan etc. Santa Monica is only 20 minutes or so by taxi/car from LAX , is safe area and the Pier is a great experience to walk along the pier, see side shows, artists, souvenier booths etc and generally stretch your legs and overcome any jet lag. In summer it might be crowded, especially weekends as it; as well as the beach are popular with locals. Many films have been made here over the years too many to mention, but when you get home, you will recognize the sights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterbD9553EE
30,Okay for a quick walk after dinner,It was nice walking around the pier after dinner. Unless you are into doing rides and the Ferris wheel.Otherwise it's like any other boardwalk in america. Lots of souvenirs shops and fast food.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spicysindhi
50,Awesome day with the family,The rides are fun and there are a lot of things to do. The views a amazing and the beach is right there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Magaliv86
50,Fun way to enjoy the beach without getting in the water!,"Watching the waves, eating ice cream and a cool breeze while walking the pier, the shoreline and enjoying all the people was a great day. The pier offers food, drinks, ice cream, rides, and for those getting in the water, an outdoor shower to wash off the sand. We really enjoyed our day at the Santa Monica Pier. Then we headed for the Santa Monica Promenade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dfcherry
50,"Lots to see, lots of tourists!","We used the hop- on hop-off bus to visit the iconic pier. Although crowded, it has a great vibe and is certainly worth the visit. The buskers on the pier itself were hugely entertaining and the best we've seen anywhere in the world. It is easy to while away the afternoon just watching them. There are many food options, from quick takeaway to sit down restaurant service. Regardless of age, make sure to have a ride on the beautiful carousel. The only negative was the number of homeless appealing for handouts and cigarettes in the parks near the pier ( but we found this common everywhere).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Helengrace56
30,"A must see, but outdated","A typical must see when visiting LA.Very crowded, rather outdated...Nevertheless worth a short visit.Has a real 'Zoltar' machine...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/939erwinv
40,Nice For A Tourist Stop Off,"Walking the pier is a nice experience. If you want to go to the beach, you can take stairs down to the beach. There are several restaurants and fair foods. There are rides and arcade games. There's souvenir shopping and plenty to entertain you as you walk the pier. I went here as a solo tourist and felt safe. No harassment at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jen31373
50,Family Fun,"We go back a lot. We are a family ranging in age from 3 to 72 and we all love it. We ride the rides, eat lunch on the pier, ride the carousel and take a swim. What more could you want!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C8683ODlindab
40,Hyde family of 4 from New Zealand,Great place too visit but very busy in July and also very hot. We hired bikes at the Pier for the day - cost 64.00 that we thought was reasonably priced. Rode aĺl the way down past Venice beach stopping at various shops on the way. Expect to see some outrageous people along the way. Fun day out for family,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimurah
30,Great pictures but didn't stay long,"We came here as a part of a guided tour and I'm really glad we got to see it. What I most wanted a picture of was the ""End of the Trail"" for Route 66. Since we live where Route 66 starts it was great to see the end.This pier was also the beginning of some great reality shows (Amazing Race and Great Food Truck Race Route 66). You do get some amazing views and awesome photos, but the family preferred the laid back Venice Beach with room to spread out and much more to see. That being said, Santa Monica is only a 2 mile walk from Venice and you should do it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhilMC64
40,Lots to do,Always busy and bustling! Lots of stuff to do and lots of interesting people around. If you want a break from the beach then you should definitely venture onto the pier,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joecB3952MZ
40,Great Pier...fun at the weekends,The pier is a traditional seaside pier but with a number of quirky and interesting personalities with a variety of performances. Great fun for everyone,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carol1911
50,Amazing Beach!!,This place is by far one of the most beautiful beaches! Plenty plenty people but totally enjoyed it!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Khbarrilleaux
40,Run over by Pokémon Players,Hahahahaha we couldn't believe it but obviously found ourselves in a Pokémon frenzy!!!!! Everyone was chasing them and it was standing room only on the Pier!!!! An experience in itself so we'll have to come again when it returns to normal.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnthonyTsoutsa
30,Pokemon Go Pier,"It's an historical pier that now seems inhabited by a majority of Pokemon Go players. Heads bowed to phones, walking into you and blocking the walkways. Compared to previous visits this really detracts from the carnival atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aussieboy_23
40,After Dinner Stroll,"After dining at a water view restaurant, my wife and I went for a walk on the pier. There is dining, fast food and carnival snacks and games available. The views of Malibu and Palos Verdes were fantastic. The people were colorful. The downside were the small number of mentally unstable individuals milling around. I definitely was on guard around some of the folks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jonnyjetprop
20,Just an overcrowded mess,"It's a carnival on water. The views are great but the pier doesn't take advantage of anything tranquil or scenic- unless you're eating at the restaurant. But even then the walk in your business-casual outfit can be awkward. Walk out, snap a selfie, return to land and walk along the Palisades or 3rd street promenade ( tons of descent restaurants and street entertainment)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HansAbroad
40,"great place, lots of people, lots to do","Carnival, restaurants, scenery, gift shops, etc. Crawling with oodles of people is this place. parking is horrible as both the freeway i-10 and PCH1 both feed directly here. big beach to the north of the Pier collects thousands of people!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/digdeep0169
50,"Amazing time, Beautiful place","What a amazing experience at Santa Monica Pier. Beautiful people. amazing vie, great atmosphere. Love it so much. Will go there again and again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rajat74778
50,Beyond Expectations,"The Pier was an amazing stop on our short holiday to LA from Las Vegas. A spontaneous choice, Santa Monica Pier surpassed the descriptions and delivered on the total ""pier/carnival"" experience. There was a HUSH dance party going on, rides and food of course, and the beautiful Pacific Ocean. People-watching is free, and we soaked it up...mostly watching the Pokemon Go players!I highly recommend this stop when visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonathanw263
50,A must visit!,"Really fun place with plenty to do and see, definitely a must do if you have a family with kids. Or if you're just a big kid like me haha!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/afc1988
50,Dinner and catch up time,"We (husband, brother in law, nephew, and I ) all went to the pier to catch up on life as well as walk on the beach with playing in the waves waiting for our dinner reservations for Bubba Gump restaurant. It was an amazing time to walk the pier to see the sites, sounds and watch the sun set over the ocean. Great atmosphere and so much to do for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amm2975
50,A Staple in LA,"This pier has lived many lives, and is one of the most enduring features of the LA / Santa Monica coastal landscape. The rides are tame but fun, there are great summer time events like movies and concerts, and plenty of fun bars and restaurants. I personally just like walking on the pier. Its worth a look",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/615jackd
40,Great Summer spot,We went around 630p on Saturday and it was still so crowded even when we left at 10p...with people still coming in. The views were beautiful. I suggest you get there early or off peak hours if you plan on eating at one of the restaurants on the pier. The wait is soooo long. The Albright was the fastest at 45min. Bubba Gump was the longest at 2.5hours. But they do have a few food carts for snacks and small munchies to hold you over.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ennaj1111
50,Exactly like you'd think it would be,"Don't be all surprised when you get here & there's folks & cool stuff to look at everywhere, it's RIGHT outside Los Angeles. The Pacific Ocean is beautiful & perfectly visible from here. Bring your camera & some loot & enjoy the atmosphere. DON'T FORGET YOUR SHOES! I DID manage to hook up w/ a large splinter that I wasn't trying for. Be blessed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frankhamay
40,Fun,"Santa Monica Pier has always been a family favorite. Although a lot of the time it is very busy, we still manage to have a lot of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claudia112perez
30,Pier with too many people,"I guess the popularity of this place and presence of a theme park is what causes this place to be over crowded.Many people, less food options and only good if you have young kids.The beach is nice but crowded. Good view though, if you can manage seat at hotspot",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PushkinBansal
50,Was a really neat place,Visited the Pier while at the Santa Monica Beach and it was a really neat place. The rides all looked fun and the lines were moving smoothly. I can just imagine how they looked from up in the air!!! Was able to see a sailboat and amazing looking waves from the Pier headed out into the water and a great picture opportunity!! Next time I'll be on the rides!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlaytimewithMiss_T_e
50,Lots do do with a beautiful beach,"Set right into the sea, this pier has rides, parking, restaurants and things to do.The weather is fair, take sunblock for the day and maybe take a jumper for the evening.It's really worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V327YSandrews
50,Vibrant and unmissable,You can't not go to this pier and see the energy it produces . Went on a weekend and it was packed . If your in la don't miss it . A must see,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T1747XOmarkr
40,Old fashioned fun on a historic pier,"The Santa Monica Pier has lots of fun in different ways. There's the Pacific Park which has thrill rides (not scary) and the iconic ferris wheel. There are plenty of places to eat, from cheap to expensive. You can enjoy looking at the beach and watch the waves crash on shore as well as the Santa Monica shoreline. The pier can now be reached by the Metro Expo line which terminates just a few blocks from the Pier. Santa Monica Place and the Third Street Promenade are also nearby, so there are many shops and restaurants in short walking distance. Nice day to spend at the beach at the end the road for Highway 66.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech522
50,Lovely..,We came in here to meet my partner's friend. This is the famous Santa Monica. Makes me remmber Baywatch time.. and all those movies that has girls on roller blades wearin bikinis.It was a good stroll..relaxing.I would definitely come back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellene_santos

50,Fun walk,We walked out to the pier and took lots of pictures. It was fun to see a famous place on a gorgeous day. We went in the shops but didn't do any of the amusement rides or activities.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bradswife55
30,"SO busy, which made it a little uncomfortable","This was my third or forth time at the pier, but the first time going at night. Oh my GOSH was it busy! Honestly, every single phone I looked at had Pokemon Go on it, so I'm 100% sure that it was packed because of this. I even heard a few people talking about how there were so many there. If you go while this craze is still huge, then it will probably be uncomfortably busy as well. Luckily we only went to go on the Pacific Wheel so we did that and left. The line took almost an hour though.If you like carnival games and rides, then this is the place for you. If not I would say you can skip it (maybe after taking one iconic photo).My last thought is that for such a popular place, they need to keep their bathrooms cleaner. I don't have words for what I saw in a few of those. 😨",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrslibrarian23
50,The beautiful Santa Monica Pier,We recently drove over to the Santa Monica Pier after flying into LA. The pier is a piece of Americana that you've got to visit if you're in the area. We rode the ferris wheel and had a wonderful lunch at The Albright. We had a really grand time at the pier!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TOMMYB707
40,Great day for everyone,"Santa Monica Pier was extremely busy the day we were there, a weekend . The beach beside the pier is beautiful but crowded. The pier itself has lots to see and do with a carousel for the kids which is under cover, great to get out of the sun for a while & a Ferris Wheel in the amusement park. There's ice cream shops, a Bubba Gump store, lots of other places to buy souvenirs or food. Great area at the end of the pier to fish. Plenty to see & do even if you don't want to swim at the beach or fish off the pier, great spot & very picturesque.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sm05060
50,Pokemon Haven plus more,"Having visited the pier years ago I was happy to be returning. The atmosphere is fun and lively. Great place to people watch! Love to go to the end and watch the people fishing.Seems to be even more crowded with Pokémon Go in full effect over the world.So here are my cautions ... have a charged phone, keep your kids close, hit up the Pokestops and watch for crowds running in a direction together because chances are there is a rare Pokémon that just appeared, avoid the weekends, and actually look up ... get your face out of your phone so you don't run into people because you will surely have people run into you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flblondee
50,A great teenager and toddler mix of fun,"So fun and priced right for an arm band ride experience. Great for teenagers and toddlers 42"" tall. The games were fun and the food was good. The artists and the souvenirs were well priced. Have to ride the Farris wheel!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O8965XNmichellem
30,great if you're under 25....,"I love Santa Monica, and the pier is fun during the day. The breeze and ocean smell is wonderful, and the old and new rides are great. I even enjoy the arcade where we play Skeeball and Foosball.In the middle of tourist season on a Saturday night, it is packed with youth and young families. I mean packed; extremely, scarily crowded. I would be afraid to bring small children there, for fear of losing track of them in the crowd. While I don't always mind being in crowds, I don't like shuffling along like the ""walking dead go to disneyland"", waiting in long lines for most rides, etc. I walked out to the end and back with several friends on a Saturday night in July. We rode the beautiful old merry-go-round, played in the arcade, wandered around a bit, and actually got got in a crowd that barely moved trying to get out. Next time, I'd maybe try a Monday night, go on a weekday, or wait til Fall...?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/telegirl68
40,Wonderful sunset view,"One of the most famous marks of the city , we enjoyed a walk through the pier , it was great the different crowds , must see attraction .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrArafat
40,Walked the pier at night- pretty,Spent a beautiful evening walking on the pier. We didn't go on any rides but did enjoy the evening. They have little shops set up so it was neat to see all that was offered.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/197christinem
30,A fun place to visit ... By Metro E line,"We came to the Pier to see the sights and enjoy the sunset. We found horrific traffic getting there and especially getting away. If you have to drive, pre-plan your parking location for Right-turns to quickly get you away from the water front. Better yet, park a stop or two away on the Metro E line and walk the three long blocks from the last station to the pier. Trust me on this one - don't try to drive right to the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/651RobertC
30,Fun place to spend money,"The pier has some good views along the beach towards the cliffs at Malibu.There are plenty of opportunities to spend money, with gift shops and restaurants, as well as the small theme park which has a ferris wheel and a small rollercoaster.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephenr613
50,Wow,Walking along the broadwalk to the famous pier wow even tho it's on a slight hill it is worth the walk. Beautiful food and clothing stores at very good prices.*********And lots of Pokemon on the pier ******,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/70kaz
20,Nothing special,"Just a place at the shore line. Luna Park for the little ones, way too crowded burger restaurant though pretty good. Come here only if you want to have a day at the beach otherwise you can skip - does not worth the traffic challenge to get here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nadavei
30,Ok but pretty much like any seaside prier,Went with my girlfriend and it was a pleasant visit however didn't stay long as it's really more tailored to younger children. Good that we checked it out briefly but didn't hang out there too long.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmzD_12
30,"Cool sight, nice pier to visit.","Very typical fight to visit in area. Enjoyable to walk around and see the ""typical coastal"" scene as you have in so many tv shows and such. Prices for the attractions are what you should expect for a beach attraction. Visited it before and like the feel of the place for walking around after a meal in one of the area restarants up on the walking street area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z2134VDjonathanl
50,Great time was had by all!,"Came here for a night with my family in March, had dinner, ice cream, watched the sunset and rode rides. We had a blast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missangela025
40,Santa Monica Pier,"Crowded, colourful, loud place wit restaurants, funfair and shops. As you probably expect the prices of souvenirs and food are ridiculously high but the place and the view from there are definitely worth to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anikita86
40,A Real Landmark,"Spent a few hours there on a bright sunny day. Lots of buskers and entertainment. Plenty of souvenir stands and amusements for the kids.Quite a few places to get something to eat or drink as well.And of course it is the start of the historic Route 66, something that is well publicized.Worth a visit if heading to Santa Monica",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mlewis66
50,So much to see and do,"This is a magic spot to visit and chill and take in the vibe. Whether it is to play on the side shows or eat at Bubba Gumps or just people watch, its a place you can go again and again",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KavaFiji
50,Great people watching,Just a great spot to hang out during the day and watch people. Especially now that the train goes here it makes it easy to hit it up for a day of beaching/ drinking/ eating.Must see spot in LA next to Venice beach.If you're staying near Hollywood Blvd take note that in July 2016 it took us two hours to get to SM on the train. So plan accordingly. We heard it was one hour but not the case.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Funkyjive5
40,Authentic,"Loved the pier, so used to seeing it on television was nice to actually be there. People playing music and singing, great to stroll along and people watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barker97
50,Santa Monica Pier,"Very nice area to relax, watch the surfers, eat some snacks. We met our Chinese friends after a busy tradeshow at the pier. So nice to be outside, you can either watch the history of the pier on the plaquettes, or walk down to the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Goldmund65
20,Now it's done there is no need to return,"This place seems to me to be designed strictly for tourists. Overpriced, extremely busy and so not enjoyable. But I've done it now and will never return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NUFCadl
40,End of Vacation,The pier was cool and very busy. We stopped by and kids went on rides. A bit overpriced but it's a tourist trap. It is a must see though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philips394
30,Eclectic mix,"Visited on Sunday 10th so very busy, very crowded but still entertaining. The whole of life is here from the homeless to bible preaching, musicians to tacky souvenir sellers. The area is definitely worth a visit and the Pacific Park has some fun rides ( how often do you get to have a roller coaster ride in such a setting? ).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adrianme97
30,Blackpool with sun,It's worth one visit to say you've been. The arrival of the tram link to LA makes this very busy all the time. Free concerts are mega busy and you need to be early to get within 200m on the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tcp1002017
50,Still lots of fun,"My first time to the pier was almost 20 years ago and it's still just as fun. Lots of people, lots to do, and the beach is fun for all ages. Rent a bike and head to Malibu or go the other way to Venice. So much fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K2service
50,Nice bay...,"One of the loveliest bays I've ever seen...sea is blue ...sky is blue...many restaurants are there...seafood and many other items besides drinks...it's always crowded...there are happy hours in many places...you can walk, swim, hear music, play arcade games...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IssaMaalouf
50,People-Watching Mecca,I found my attention bouncing between the street performers like the rock-roll Jesus and the people that are taking in these performances. The fact that I was on a pier over the Pacific could hardly compete.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardLovesDining
50,Cute!,"So cute and nice to see a pier doing so well! There are live musicians and fairground rides as well as shops and people making products to sell, we bought a little momentum from a man who painted the pier using just his fingers and these were only $10 so very reasonable!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kay8991
40,The pier is a beautiful place!,We visited the pier on a beautiful bright sunny day and saw the amazing views up and down the beach. Was awesome to see how many people using various methods of transport on the path and the alternate gym equipment set up in the sand. Recommend visiting if your in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackr763
30,Bucket list visit item...,Be prepared to park away and walk along the foreshore. This is ok cause it's all about the journey just to say you've been there done that. Still I do it every visit and I enjoy it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatW338
10,BIG disappointment,"I went here with my spouse, our 6 yr old and 3 year old. Everything was soooo overpriced and sooooo not worth it! There were hardly any rides, let alone rides for my young kids to ride. The whole place felt dirty. I am originally from the east coast, so maybe I'm biased on what a boardwalk amusement park should look/feel like. Who spends $35-$40 on four ppl to ride a Ferris wheel ONCE?!?!? Complete rip off! I'll take the east coast any day over this nonsense!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/489nicolec
10,"Crowded, dirty, pricey tourist trap","I know this is a very iconic LA landmark, but admire from afar--do not waste your time walking the pier, buying junky trinkets or braving the overpriced rollercoaster. Instead rent a bike nearby & hip on the Strand -the paved pathway that runs south to Venice Beach. You'll get a real sense of the beach communities while biking in the sun & taking in the beautiful ocean views!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theresaw
30,Surprised at Homeless problem,"We wanted to see Santa Monica and especially the pier while in the area. My kids and I parked quite a way from the pier and enjoyed a stroll along the promenade to the pier. We were struck by to things, the cleanliness and upscale nature of the Santa Monica area compared to other places we visited in the area. That said it contrasted with the HUGE homeless problem the area has. You could not walk more than 10 feet along the promenade without there being more homeless people sleeping out (this was late morning/early afternoon). I felt bad for the homeless and it is clearly a problem for the area. However, to have the homeless on show throughout the beach front area is a huge tourist problem for the local community. Overall we enjoyed the stay but definitely marred by this problem and not sure it is top of our list to return to.Santa Monica pier had quite a bit to offer, but on the day we arrived the pier attractions had a private event so we could not let the kids go on any of the rides :(",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mjr0108
50,Easy access to Pier-lots to do!,"The Santa Monica Pier was lots of fun. It is very crowded-packed to the hilt on weekends, but still worth the trip there. Much to do-bars, restaurants, the ice cream at Soda Jerks is delicious! The rides are great and the view and ocean breeze are fantastic. You can park right next to the Pier or go a few blocks into town for some cheaper parking lots.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/370camilleq
50,Festive and fabulous,Such a good vibe on this Pier!! Lots to see and do and eat!! Even the public sanitation stops were pretty decent - keeping in mind that on a busy day 1000's of visitors are accommodated. Visible POLICE gives a good sense of feeling save. Thank you SANTA MONICA❤️,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dillieg
50,California must,"You can't claim you have been to Los Angeles until you go here. The atmosphere is upbeat and the weather is wonderful. Take a sweater at night.You can eat junk food,people watch or have a nice dinner. And don't forget the rides",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/acahillmd
10,Gross,"Massive crowds of dirty masses clamoring around with bratty kids and crying babies. If you're smart enough to read tripadvisor for this, don't go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertcN5456HR
50,Beautiful area,Sightseeing at thos famous pier is a must see while visiting this area. This is a world famous place. Well worth the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meongo123
30,It's ok,I spent the day there and it was OK. Glad I went and had a look around but it might be better with going with the kids to play at he beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/360waynel
10,"Too crowded, not worth it","If you're visiting LA this is obviously a must stop but it's not really worth it. We didn't go on a ride, the lines were too long. It was way over crowded, especially the beach. There are other parts of Santa Monica to stroll around in, stay away from the Pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/563bent
50,Fun place to go to unwind,"The vibe of this place is electric. While there are always people and usually a lot going on, it's a perfect place to stroll and unwind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelRobs
30,What up Dock.,"From the Ferris wheel to dock performers, to the fishers at the end of he dock, there is something for everyone in the family to enjoy.All of the carnival favorites are included: funnel cakes, rides and roller coasters, carnival games with big tacky prizes. Here are charcature drawings, speedy name-paintings, performers singing or doing comedy. The restaurant prices range from a decent burger and fries being inland price to the restaurant and souvenir shop at the edge of the dock being a bit pricier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K9773YVandrewb
40,So crowded and expensive but fun!,Considering the amount of people on the actual pier and the size of it it is massively over crowded! Although we went on a weekend so not sure if that's why! Also depending on what you want to do there it is quite expensive at $5 per game and $5-8 per ride so the fun can only last so long. We only went for about an hour just to check it out so its worth going if you're near the beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vikkim2014
50,Lots of fun!,Fun pier for kids and a must see if your visiting the area. The rides were not running during our last trip so they may be seasonal.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmberM470
30,"Worth seeing, but big tourist hot spot","Well worth the visit, but is a big tourist hot spot. Did a lap of the pier and then walked the foreshore to Venice Beach. Would recommend the walk, it was interesting and great to soak in the atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicabS6408EK
30,Crowded,"We end up going to the pier over the weekend, while it is something I have wanted to experience from seeing this on TV, the experience did not meet the expectations. The pier was extremely overcrowded and in my view too congested to function properly. This gives you a chance to cross the final point on Route 66, but otherwise I think it is over rated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrevorBurchell
20,Iconic but run down,Sadly this iconic attraction is very run down an unpleasant. Since I'm not a local I probably don't understand the appeal but I found it dirty and very out of date by any standard.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nathan1750
40,A Step Back in Time,"We visited the pier early and didn't find it too crowded. We were limited with time and too early, so didn't go on any rides. Lots of gift shops and live entertainment with street buskers. Rock'n'Roll Jesus was excellent. Wished we could have spent longer here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/901charmaineh
40,A first visit to the Santa Monica Pier,"We walked a few blocks from our downtown dinner restaurant to the popular Santa Monica Pier. Eateries, carnival rides, street performances and beautiful ocean views can be found on the pier. There were a number of panhandlers at the entrance to the pier. The pier parking lot was very crowded. A nearby downtown parking structure may provide a good alternative to parking at the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shewoo
40,A must do at least once,"The pier seems to be a must do/see for everyone that visits Santa Monica. I would agree, but once you've seen it you probably wont need to see it again, just tick it off your bucket list. Great atmosphere, lots of rides, food choices and buskers. Bike hire just near to hire your bikes",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellejk89
40,Busy !,I visited the first week on June I believe the 8 and it was busy but awesome enjoyed the pier . We ran into Bernie sanders could explain all the people but he lots of of restaurants and little shops . Everything is a bit pricey but it's the end of Route 66 what else do you expect .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/308dustink
40,Colourful and Crowded,"A must-stop tourist site for those visiting Los Angeles. It's also the official end of R66 so a must visit spot if you've just done the journey from Chicago to LA (which we had). Plenty of restaurants, bars and other entertainment for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DomDemps
40,Recently went to the Pier on a trip to LA.,"For some reason I expected it to be a bit seedy but it was quite nice and clean and good bathrooms. I noticed the beach next to it had parking for around $14, though we parked up the street at the Promonade, which ended up being $4. The carnival games are pricey (about $5 a game). They also have a nice arcade. Good entertainment that day, and even though it was during the week, it was completely packed. Great weather the day we went - sunny with a strong breeze. I recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mynameisLuka
40,Cross Country visit with family beware of kids with flip flops.,My youngest was walking and the boards are dried out and splintering. We were walking after dusk and she got a three inch splinter that luckily did not break in between her toes while wearing flip flops. We parked at civic center parking for $5 for all day parking,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tfpslappy
50,Love the Pier,We arrived on a Thursday night and the first thing we did was stroll down to the pier where we met thousands of people hanging out listening to a free concert. People were on the pier and on the beach around the pier listening and having a great time.The next day we went down to the pier again to see the rest of the sites. It was a very pleasant stroll watching the fishermen and women cast and catch some fish. It was just very peaceful and pleasant.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MattJane
30,People watching is the real attraction here,"Very busy with rides, food, stage acts, street performers, sidewalk vendors. At night it is quite pretty from afar. I wouldn't make a special trip to Santa Monica to see this. The beach is nasty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KikiGinger
50,"Great food, entertainment, and rides","Tamales, fresh fruit, funnel cakes, live bands, jugglers, ferris wheel, roller coaster, food food food! Oh, and the ocean. Bring sunscreen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mitch708

50,Old time fun,"Great place to remember the past with ferris wheel, roller coaster and fair type stands with games. A wonderful and beautiful merry go round. Fishing takes place of the sides of the pier with restaurants available if you prefer to be served! Weekends are very busy and crowded so be early and have patience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rayberinla

50,"Rides, Food, & the Beach=FUN","I've been to the Santa Monica Pier on several different occasions, every time having FUN! There's rides for kids of all ages, the food varies from cheaper Taco Bell to fancier sit-down restaurants, & of course Santa Monica Beach. Depending on the date & time you go obviously varies on how packed the pier will be. I prefer to go later in the evening to avoid the kiddie crowd, & to enjoy the gorgeous sunset. Definitely a stopping spot while in L.A.P.S. My 7 year old son & I love the junior roller coaster :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharkInAFishTank
20,Way to crowded and commercial,"There is not much fun walking the Santa Monica Pier. Thousands of people is packed on this otherwise impressive construction, but the crowds make it unbearable to stay for more than fifteen minutes. Go to the wharf in Santa Cruz instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atlanticophelia
30,Hanging at the Pier,We were a short distance from the pier. I was very surprised to see how unclean and littered the beach and pier were...very disappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShaybaShayba
50,Worth the stop!,"This was a stop on our drive down the Pacific Hwy. We just loved it.

30,Good concerts Thursdays but no rides for kids under 5,"My daughter (3) kept begging to come here since she could see it from our hotel. When we arrived was disappointed none of the rides were for her age range. We went to disney a few days prior and there were tons of rides with no restrictions. Its a fun place to walk around but not much to do except eat funnel cake, ice cream, and churros.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K5306BXraquela
30,not my cup of tea...,"Noisy, crowded, very commercial and kinds of a wasted of time. But, something to see once. Didn't eat but the line at Bubba Gumps was horrid. It is the middle of summer.

40,Love this Pier,"SM Pier has a special place in my heart as I grew up in this area and my dad worked a few blocks away. I have seen many changes there, but I so love the carousel and the ferris wheel. Be sure to check it out when you are in the area. There is a lot of history there as well as a great view of the beaches and surrounding area. Be sure to ride the ferris wheel!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarbJC
20,No signs for parking and overpriced rides and food,"Waze took us past the pier and back again to the parking lot, which you couldn't enter from the highway. There are no signs for the large main lot, which is closer to downtown -- so be aware of this when trying to find the lot. The rides were $8 each and the food overpriced, too. We realize this is all part of the experience but was not impressed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaD741

10,"Waste of time, very crowded.",Pretty much nothing to see here accept a large crowd of mostly rude tourists and some terrible street performers. Really wouldn't recommend going.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hydrati0n9
40,"Pricey rides, but a must-do with kids",Get the wristband for all-you-can-ride - it's worth it. Good food options and live music on the pier during the summer. They also have summer concert series. The ferris wheel is awesome.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LBSanFran
30,"Overrated Attraction, underwhelming experience","The pier is fairly dated, seems like a typical tourist trap with a few rides for children only, we ate at the all bright which wasn't bad, however the entire area is purely a tourist trap, beach isn't too bad, but not to die for, the third street promenade is a pure strip filled with shops, shops that are available at ANY other place in the world. I would not go out of my way to come here again, half a day is plenty to finish seeing most of santa monica pier/third street promenade",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidlO6544UE

50,Great family location for a bit of fun,We were travelling through the US when we took a bus tour to the pier. Was a great spot to visit. Plenty to do on the pier and the beach area around for extra activities.Wasnt very pleasant in the cold and rain. Some of the rides not suitable for younger children but there was still options. The cafe was almost booked out but the Bumpa Gump Shrimp was a great alternative.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chase_AUS
50,Happy spot,"After 3 days cooped up in Culver city, I was more than ready for the famed picture-perfect California and Santa Monica did not disappoint. The area is gorgeous with lots of shops and restaurants, and the Santa Monica pier itself is a vast area filled with restaurants, souvenir shops, rides and hundreds of tourists. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit just taking in the sights and sounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/onnaedoo

40,Fun but nothing special,Fun pier with great views and plenty of entertainment. However nothing particularly special compared with other entertainment piers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/woodhf
40,Fun in the Sun,Santa Monica pier is a great day out and now busier than ever. A cool little amusement park out over the pier and on the water gives you a chance at a unique experience to ride a roller coaster or Ferris wheel atop the Pacific Ocean. Lots of good carnival foods and now super packed and busy since the train runs from LA out to Santa Monica... A good day out for anyone who wants to spend some time down near the water without getting in the sand.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DPeterF2015
50,Great place,Coming from England we have lots of piers so this was nothing new to us however it matched the ones in England brilliantly. Lots to do for families and kids if you have them. It also signals 'the end of route 66' not not officially they moved it so that it was at the end of the pier but where it actually ends is just a plaque on the floor further down the road so this is the best place for pictures with a Route 66 sign,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/888freyal
30,Nice visit,"We were at Venice Beach but had a walk to the Santa Monica Pier.It is a crowded place and the prices for food, beverages and ice creams were almost doubled in comparising with the prices at the beach.The view is amazing when you reached the end and is worth the walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/932ThomasR

30,The end of Route 66- Santa Monica Pier,"Some years ago i decided to drive through the Mohave desert on Route 66, and its a nice memory. Last year we visited the Santa Monica Pier which has the sign saying end of Route 66, thats an event in itself. The actual pier is slightly tacky with fairground rides and hot dog cafe etc. You can have a nice walk along the wide beach. Its worth a stop along with Venice Beach, before hitting Santa Monica Boulevard towards Hollywood. The pier has been in loads of movies and tv shows , including Forrest Gump (there is a Bubba Gump Shrimp Company Restaurant on the pier, owned by the company that produced the film). We were too tight to use one of the pay car parks and parked a bit along the road in one of the small streets coming off the beach. We are returning this month and will surely again visit the pier. Oh and by the way your kids will know it well from the game Grand theft Auto. regards Banjo",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/306freda
40,Route 66,"Ended our visit in the pier where the Route 66 officially finishedPier was packed solidThere are plenty of traders offering food, drinks and souvenirs but my favourite was an old silver trailer full of Route 66 memrobillia see attached pictureThe pier has a fair ground with rides and these are priced at what you would expectThe usual beggars are on the pier holding up signs but they do not pester you like they have done in other citiesParking is really expensive $12 for 12 minutes! But we were told the pier offered cheaper parking but the queue was extremely long, but our hotel was only a few minutes walk and so parking was not an issue for usThe beach is sandy and very popularOverall lovely place would recommend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/447stephb
50,GREAT DAY AT THE BEACH,"We don't have jetty's (piers) like this in south Australia, nor many in Australia, so visiting here was a treat. Felt like a real American. We had a great look around, rode the rollercoaster and Ferris wheel, plus played a few arcade games, and had lots of food to eat. We stayed here for 2-3 hours and had a great time. I actually enjoyed this better than Venice beach. Santa Monica Pier is actually the official end for Route 66. At the end of the pier there is a Route 66 sign and a little memorabilia shop there too, so we grabbed our souvenirs from here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tanias733
50,Great artist in Santa Monica pier,Look for Luis he makes the most amazing 3D and regular painting. He's a young artist who can draw so beautiful. He's very nice and polite. He's frames are inexpensive around $12.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Catirita001
30,A local tourist trap in all it's glory,"Holy crap this place is crowded!For being a local pier, it pulls double duty. You've got your local fisherman posted up angling for whatever bites as well as all of the locals grabbing a spot on the sand to sun and swim all day mixed with a giant surge of tourists who are there to see the sights and ride the rides.Parking isn't too bad from a tourism point of view but at $10.00, I don't think I would pay it if I were a local. You can get your kids a wristband for Pacific park and they can ride all of the rides unlimited for as long as you are there so that is a good value. The pier itself has a funland arcade as well as a Bubba Gump Shrimp Factory and a mexican restaurant called Mariasol. Other than those two sit down places, there are two different burger joints and a place that sells funnel cakes.There is always more than enough entertainment while you are on the pier because every aspiring local artist likes to set up shop and sell their wares to anyone willing to stop and look or listen. We saw a violinist as well as a man painting caricatures. An 11 year old girl who was either a pianist or a comedian or both but I couldn't tell. We saw street performers dancing and singing and preaching the word.There is no lack of things to keep you occupied while you're on the pier. We ended up eating at Mariasol while we were there and just enjoyed the sunshine and cool breeze before heading back to our hotel.I would suggest Santa Monica Pier as a nice tourist destination but I would also advise you to research it for busy times. Otherwise the traffic and parking and crowds can get a bit overwhelming.Have fun and thank you for reading.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrbraae
20,Masses of Humans Cover The Area,"I live in L.A. and used to go to this area a lot, until the over-development started. I went on a Friday in the summer, after not going here for quite a number of years. The traffic in L.A. has gotten to the point where it's unpleasant to drive to the beach anymore from my location in Hollywood.I was actually shocked when I arrived at the Third Street Promenade to park my car, at the number of tourists there. We walked down to the pier, and it was like walking in a herd of cattle. Moooooo. There were so many people here that I'd say this is not a good place to go to get any kind of California experience. If you love massively tourist-filled crowded events and places---and I mean crowded-- then this will be fine for you. For me, it was just awful! We walked away from the pier and things got a little less congested, but for me, the whole ""vibe"" of the place has changed for the worse. Too bad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/538suzannee
50,"""Love the Pier""",Nice to walk along and watch the fisherman to see what they have caught. Last time we visited someone had caught a baby shark but thankfully the pier police made them put it back.Stopped at Bubba Gumps for food,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaz110965
40,The Famous Pier,"Worth a visit if in Santa Monica, but just a tacky pier like any British seaside pier but with the sun!The wheel was good value at $8 each",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LesClaireM
40,Pier Fun,Always a good time at the pier and went to Pacific Park as well. Love the views and sense of timelessness and history. Definitely a sketchy element around so need to be safe and keep eyes open.

30,Overcrowded on Sunday evening,"I am sure it varies on when you visit, but on a Sunday in June the place is a zoo. I love the history behind the pier, especially related to Route 66, but the parking was treacherous and walking around was difficult at best. I would recommend going during the week.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iroamaround67801
40,Classic. Good place to see the sunset!,"I like the Santa Monica Pier. It is a little messy, but it is a good place to see the sunset. Dogs are welcome. After that, you can eat something around. There is a huge parking lot close to the pier, just check the GPS and you will find it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/463raphaeln
20,Boring,"There really is not much to enjoy at the Pier.Go once, walk around and the few things they have and avoid all of the people.Even on a Thursday afternoon, it was a zoo and way too busy.It's a tourist trap that is not worth the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/501erics

40,Santa Monica Pier,"Santa Monica pier is great! The views from the big wheel are incredible. There are lots of little stores which sell lots of touristy items such as key rings and magnets which are good for gifts. On the pier is a restaurant called Pier Burger, the food is delicious, however it can get quite crowded which is to be expected. Prices of things to do on the pier are reasonable too. Overall, it's a great way to spend an evening and watch the sun set over the Pacific. Truly beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilyd518
40,4th of July visit,We got there early on the 4th of July and it was not too busy yet. Nice atmosphere and lots of people fishing. At the end of the pier there is a nice view over the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D4551DCmarcb
40,Aussie,Walking this wonderful pier was great. Just a little disappointing that we were not aware of the fireworks display being held on the evening we were there. The end of the pier was closed off and when we asked what was happening we were told by security they were filming. The next day we were told about the fireworks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gillianb644
30,Overpriced,"I'm originally from LA, and every year that I go back, I try visiting Santa Monica pier. But some of the prices have gotten outrageous. One ride on the Ferris Wheel (which I used to love) is $8! An unlimited pass is $28 (for age 8 and over), so I was only willing to get the $17 unlimited pass for my under 7 year-old. And the mini-bowling at the arcade is $1 (for 10 balls) -- I remember when it was 25 cents. At those rates, the Carousel for $2 is a bargain, and there's now a good ice cream counter next to it. At least it's still free to walk around and people watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yoritomo
50,Pretty place and well looked after,"Really liked this place, although just walked through.Walked from Venice all along the front an is a nice walk.Santa Monica is nicer than Venice, although the latter has its charms (my 18 year old daughter assures me) I am sure, although they escape me for now.Venice canals are pretty and worth the extra walk though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travisthedog

40,Must See,"This place is a must when travelling to LA. Better yet, stay at a hotel here if you can. It's clean, fun and a great beach. Warning - wear something on your feet as the sand can get really hot - and watch out for syringes - we saw a syringe cap though no actual needle as we traversed the beach to the water. A truly beautiful spot. Wish we had more time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ozzietraveller69
40,"Great fun, lots of people","Beautiful beach views, great restaurants, lots of activity on the boardwalk and that's all before you even get onto the Pier with the rides. Street performers abound. It's a fun place to visit for the whole family if you don't mind crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonegQ9869QZ
40,Tourist check list,It was nice to check the list of going to the pier. Rode the giant Ferris wheel which gives you great views. Lots of little rides and carnival type games. Not cheap - $8 a ride and $5 a game for most things. Several souvenir shops and restaurants too. Fun to walk out to the end and look at the views down the coast line.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MonicaC878

30,The SoCal version of Blackpool,"Visiting Santa Monica Pier brought back childhood memories of family outings to Blackpool in England. Although there is no Tower and most of the entertainment is on the Pier the whole experience was a mixed bag. I loved the ""Old World"" charm of the Roller coaster, the Ferris Wheel and the Drop ride but I could have done without the smell of fried foods and popcorn. The Views from the Ferris wheel are worth the price of admission alone, you are far enough out on the pier that you can see right along the coast as well as see the surfers in action. If you want to watch the pier come alive in the evening you should visit the Blue Streak Lounge at the Loews Hotel, makes for a great photo op.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BreezeRidge3
30,Tourist Trap but nice for kids,The pier is iconic to Santa Monica. Lots of fun for younger families. Mostly a tourist trap. Watch out walking on the Pier as it is wooden and uneven.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rglaskin
40,"Eat, play, enjoy the view.","Join the millions of people that have walked the historic Santa Monica Pier. Built in the 1930s, the pier has become synonymous with Santa Monica. It is filled with amusements, free theme park rides, shops restaurants, and even an aquarium. You can't go to Santa Monica without visiting the Pier. On any given day you can enjoy live entertainment from the area's locals strumming their guitars and singing popular songs. They are quite good. You will also see local artists painting, drawing and sculpting the pier patrons. There is a lower deck for fishing, lots of deck space facing the ocean, and restrooms at the end of the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davec110
30,A good day out,"We enjoyed our day here, plenty to do and see. Worth a look. It was a bit dirty there which I wasn't expecting. Definitely not as nice as I thought it would be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E5891
50,Best Beach by Far,"My boyfriend and I went to California for our vacation and of course we had to visit the infamous Santa Monica Pier. It was absolutely beautiful, we didn't really walk the boardwalk or visit any eats or attractions there besides the beach, but it was absolutely beautiful, it was more of a party/bar scene at some places, my boyfriend and I don't really do that but I'm sure the experience would be great. The beach was stunning, the waves weren't that bad and they sell Mangoes, watermelon, beach umbrellas.. etc, there's a man or woman walking past every five minutes to sell. Living in NY I'm not a fan of having stuff on the floor of the beaches and I didn't have that problem in California at all, the beaches were beautiful and clean! Be careful not to go too far because the waves do get extremely aggressive past a certain time and it randomly fluctuates, you don't want to be caught in the middle of a big wave because another one will come after that one, back to back. The shore is long, so it's easy to end up far in the water, so please be careful, you can have just as much fun close to shore.. Don't make the same mistake I did, I scratched my knee and was caught in the middle of multiple strong waves, I did like a million cartwheels and couldn't find the surface because they just kept coming, the shore was very far for me to get out of the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/74genesisr
30,Nice pier but too crowded,Typical touristy pier. Not a lot of shops. Mainly street performers and a few small amusement park rides. We just found there wasn't much to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelbyhutch
30,Wasn't impressed,It's very carnival like and if you like that it is a place for you. It's not very clean and the bathrooms were filthy! Trash and dirty diapers everywhere in the bathroom. Maybe it's not always like this and just the day I came. I know it's a busy place but it looked like they changed the trash and cleaned the bathroom 2 months ago.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsshellyB
20,stay away,this pier is a waste of your time and money. The rides stink and the pier is way over-crowded. Over over priced waste of time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bcnyyan

50,Another must visit place!,"Unless you plan to hang out on sand at edge of water, a couple hours is what you need to see. Rent a bike ride down to Venice Beach and back. A morning in between both beaches is plenty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BestTravelsNow
40,A Fun Distraction...,"When visiting LA, the Santa Monica Pier is definitely a nice distraction for one evening. Its about 20-min from LA by freeway, and a very easy drive (even considering LA traffic).Suggestions:While there is a selection of food, I would not recommend this as your dinner destination.Parking is insane and can get expensive. If you're a solo traveller, like I was, I suggest valet across the street from the Pier (the pink building). This is the safe and secure option if you will be returning late at night. Otherwise, there are parking structures about a block or to off the beach. There is a beach lot, however it's extremely difficult to access.Pacific Park was interesting, and obviously a must to actually experience the Pier.Definitely try 'Soda Jerks' it the very first place you come to, and in the carousel building. A bit pricey, but you get what you pay for, and it was good.There are transients everywhere, so I'd suggest be mindful of your surroundings, and respectful that this is their home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CMB7694
30,Very tired and needs updating,The fun park is really dated and the games room is pretty average!The views are great and enjoyed cold beers at the restaurant at the end of the pier!Prob wouldn't go again!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisamL8687YW
30,Nice view of the Pacific,"We came out to the pier to see the Pacific Ocean. It had some nice views, but it was an overcast day. The place was busy with lots of people and street performers. We didn't ride anything, but just looked around. There were plenty of options for eating, if you wanted to stay a while.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jans778
50,By riding the large ferris wheel we could see so much of the Santa Monica area. It was AMAZING!!,"We enjoyed walking to the end of the pier seeing people fishing & peering into their buckets to see what they were catching. At the end of the pier was a great Mexican restaurant where we ate. There was a ""Pigeon Man"" who was feeding the pigeons from his pockets & they were on top his head, shoulders, & arms. It was a sight to see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunshine19531977
40,Easy Breezy!Beautiful!,This is a great place to visit Solo or with the family it's beautiful out and the breeze is blowing. There are plenty of things to do and lots of entertainment. The end of Route 66 is located here on this pier as well. Traffic can be a bit much to reach this location but it's very much worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rychlyfe2019
30,Feels like jersey shore,"We went to the pier early one weekday morning and parked in a nearby garage. The Ferris wheel was a nice activity. We ate at a Mexican restaurant overlooking the beach. The views are nice, but there are a few unusual characters on the pier (for those with younger children). The pier didn't feel like a must-see for those who have seen other shore towns (like on the jersey shore).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cbr00k
30,Crowded,"Typical beach pier with tons of people and activities. This would be a great place to people watch if you're into that kind of thing. They have quite a number of street performers too, including a guy dressed like Elmo (similar to times square in new york city).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chickabeegrrl
50,SMP 🎉,Santa Monica Pier is one of the main attraction when you visit the famous California. Santa Monica's beach is very popular and there are also celebrities who shoot a movie there and the place is very breath taking because of the fresh air and the ambiance. The rides are worth it and there are so many prizes that you can win when you play a game there. Santa Monica is definitely a goal in your bucket list!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Auiedelmundooo
30,Must see,While in Santa Monica you have to stop by the pier just to say that you've been there. There are some very talented artist there so be sure to check out their work. Stay clear of the arcade. It badly needs an update and the games are rather expensive. Also prepare for a uphill hike back to the Main Street. It is steep and quite a climb.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/94jacquib

40,Alright for a quick visit,"The beach is well kept and it's nice to see where so many film scenes and Baywatch of course have been made.The pier itself is quite old now and very dated but I suppose that is part of its charm, especially the arcade with the retro games consoles the size of a house.We had a picnic on the beach which was a nice touch but there are some restaurants if you'd rather sit in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hirsty1980UK

30,This place is nuts!!,"So my wife and I took a day trip here and I don't think anything could have prepared us for the craziness that entailed. First of all, we are from North Carolina and much prefer the sleepy, quiet beach side towns where the crowds are small and you can relax. This was 100% the opposite of Santa Monica Pier.While the sights and sounds were amazing and will definitely leave a memorable impression on us, there wasn't a ton about this spot that had either of us dying to come back. We love Cali and I know there are a ton of ""sleepy, relaxing"" beaches all up and down the cost but I'll stick with my NC beaches! Plus the water is so much warmer!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryman982

Lotsa people, some good restaurants, and it's worth it to see them catching fish , and when we were there a school of dolphins testing the mobile phones on the Peir . Zoltan was there of course, buskers for the kids and it's close to the mall. Worth seeing , but maybe I should have gone to the movie tour, it's rather like the Gold Coast at home. We took the 704 bus back to west Hollywood with some friendly AUSSIE girls, a great adventure.Happy days",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevep993

40,Santa Monica Beach and Pier,"This was the first time in California and wanted to see the attractions. The beach area was clean and spent hours swimming in the ocean and waves. Walking in the sand is not easy but you go slow and you will enjoy your time. Headed to the Santa Monica Pier to grab a bite to eat. Prices were a little higher than I would have expected but food was good. The rides were not free, suggest you buy a card possibly from Groupon if you have a family. The Ferris Wheel gave you a great view of the surrounding. Definitely worth seeing. Places to change from Swimming to Clothing also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lorisreview

20,Very disappointing,"Perhaps I had set my expectations too high but I was not impressed at all by the pier. The ocean is absolutely gorgeous and fighting your way through the crowd to the end of the pier is definitely worth it! I was not impressed by the attractions, the food options, or the street vendors. I think it is worth going so that you can say that you have experienced it but do not plan to spend the day here! As for the beach area, I just felt that although it was beautiful, it was just too crowded to enjoy the view. I would also make sure that you only visit during the day and avoid being alone.

Hopped on the Ferris wheel because we wanted to check out the view from the top so that was good. Been there done that now though won't bother next time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donnam25
40,"Refreshing, Good beach, Fun pier","I love this place. The walk on the sand, the pier has many entertainer(they were good), the restaurant, the food, and the view just spectacular. It is a big tourist spot. I love the Santa Monica Boulevard as well. The parking was a bit of a challenge but we found this parking building between Arizona St and third St. Just a walking distance to the shopping village and the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/csoriaso
30,Nice to see but nothing special,"A place which is nice to see, but if you miss it you missed nothing. The view is nice... if the weather is clear. As we discovered, if the sun shines in Beverly Hills/WeHo, it doesn't mean that it shines on the ocean coast. The restaurants are more to tourists not for gastro tourists or those who like good/quality food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tam_so578
40,Fun visit,"We did not sunbathe or swim, but we took a leisurely walk all the way from Santa Monica to Venice Beach. Santa Monica is a nicer area with a variety of good food, recreation, and amateur entertainment. It's about a 1 1/2 - 2-Mile walk one way from SM to Venice. Venice Beach has a little more unusual visitors and I wouldn't have wanted to take young children there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/110anitaa

50,Excellent Place to take Teens at Night!,"If you are looking for a nice family place to keep teenagers happy, the pier is excellent.

40,Family get together,"Now that I have so much family in LA, it is difficult to visit and see everyone.

Don't miss the sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/159christianp

50,Santa Monica pier,"This is one of my favorite places to bring visitors. There are bike paths and pedestrian walk path that you can enjoy the view of the ocean. It's great to visit around the sunset too. You get beautiful sunset pictures. While walking there you will see muscle beach( the original muscle beach is here not in Venice beach). Beneath the pier there is the aquarium and many restaurants and a well known 'The big dean'. On the pier there are amusement pacific park and many restaurants. Also you can. visit the famous carousel ,Mary go round ( the movie sting shot here.

I don't go for the rides although they look fun, I go for the view and the feeling of endless summer that envelopes my soul. This place has a great ambience with plenty of street performers to entertain you along with incredible views of both Venice & Santa Monica. Find a bar stool or a bench and settle into a place called Chillax!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/papag611

40,Kiss me Quick,"The sign onto the pier makes it seem like quite a grand place, but as you decend down to the actual pier it seems a bit tacky, that said it turned out to be a nice trip. The Pier itself is quite old & it shows in the planking you walk on but the attractions all seem good from watching the people learning the trapeze to the Ferise Wheel at the end. There are many places to eat from bergers & hotdogs to sit down meals. We ate at the Albright/SM Pier Seafood which was excellent, provided you like seafood which we do, on the whole a good evening out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveHutch1946
30,"Its nice, but its not necessary.","My title may seem like it's not kind to the all famous Santa Monica Pier, but I say that mainly because the pier is quite similar to say, the Venice Beach Boardwalk. There are people selling food with carts, there are troubadours/howling ""rappers"" with $2 mixtapes, there is fast food, there are some touristy sights ... but unless it's just a check mark on your list, I can't see this as an exciting place over and over again. Hell, I sadly paid $5 for a coke here. I shouldn't have expected anything less, but still...Anyway, there's a beautiful beach to be explored, there are stores where you can get your own food/drink, and boom! Unless you need a roller coaster then you're really fine without the pier.That's why I give it a 3. Because it's not bad, it's just not necessary.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/structureofzero

30,Now I have seen it.,And it's worth going there. Just to have seen it.They have kept a lot of the old interior and it feels like the 50s but it's a classic tourist place. Nothing wrong with that.We took a stroll and that was enough and after we jumped in to the ocean and that was fantastic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monfager
40,Quick visit with friends,"My first time to town so I'm sure I looked like a tourist. The pier and the area around it are filled with street performers of all types. Bums are out and about also so be aware of your surroundings and keep up with your kids. Some really neat sights and shops. All in all, it's a tourist trap and not a place where locals will be found much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brockk69
40,California Vacation,My kids loved it. Lots of people and typical board walk activities. The view on the beach and ocean excellent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daddy68
40,Fun time!,"The pier has so many shops, places to snack/eat at & the view from the pier is breathtaking. There is a lot of fun for the whole family if you visit pacific park, too. Overall a fun experience. The only downside is that it was extremely busy (but that is to be expected).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missbeccaBSNRN
20,Beach is nice; pier ok for people watching,"The Pacific Ocean beach is impressive, stretching for miles. Beach volleyball courts, exercise areas, and occasional singers and musicians can be seen along the beach and in the pier. A few restaurants, a few amusement park rides and arcade that remind me somewhat negatively of times past. Food options are limited. Nice walk along paved areas along the ocean extending north and south of the pier. If you do choose to visit 2hrs is more than enough time. Parking options include from metered street ($2/h via credit card [or coins] with 3 hr maximum, a small lot for $1/HR (2 hr max) off Seaside on Appian Way, and various lots with a $12 entry (presumably no hr limit); there is also inexpensive parking at the convention center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelerSFBayarea
40,Small & compact but enjoyed by adults & kids.,"Pac Park wasn't exactly the most memorable part of our trip but as with any touristy destination, it's crowded & overpriced. I guess it's one of those places you just have to visit to say you've been while in So. Cal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chitown77
40,Nice to do,This part of the greater LA area is quite clean in comparison to other areas of interest. The pier is entertaining and the beaches are relatively clean. There are plenty of options for food in the area and shopping can be done at the nearby santa monica place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cammo23
40,Full of fun! Very busy!,"Finally got to Santa Monica pier, arrived in LA yesterday morning on the red eye from Hawaii, almost no sleep, found that they have metro to Downtown Santa Monica now, although it was very full, was still very cheap, got to the pier and it was super busy, this added to the atmosphere though, everyone was in high spirits, the rides were going, the weather was great and just an all time high!! Definitely worth a visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LukeFortescue

20,Commercial novelties,It was very crowdy when we were there in June. Nothing special with this place and I do not understand its popularity. A lot of commercial novelties are sold along the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/926andersm
30,A walk down the sand,"It was a late Tuesday afternoon stroll, sun was still up yet it was the breeze that gets me, it was cool & calming, the pier itself offers rides (from small roller coaster to a ferris wheel) & tons of food stalls so you don't have to worry about goin' hungry, various street performers, family & friends go around - some take a dip in the beach & some just take a walk enjoy the view. The pier is a picturesque scene right out of a postcard, you can take a walk or go run (for health buffs) or even bike & skate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iancarl0
30,Worth a walk if you are in the area,"it is mostly a tourist trap. However, if you are only going for the sights and not to spend money, it is pretty cool if you are in the area. Besides all the weird stuff at the pier and the rides, you get a nice view of the coast and the beach. it totally feels like you are watching a Baywatch tv show. The parking is a bit pricey but if they is all you are spending on this excursion, it is not so bad. Also, you can walk the Santa Monica streets from there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexWorldTour
50,Santa Monica Pier,It was a great place to visit. There were were rides for the kids. There was Music for music lovers a variety for every music lover. There were many shops and food places to eat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebeccacA8963WF
40,Nice tourist location,"We wanted to visit the SM Pier for a long time but didn't like the lack of parking situation. So we took the Expo Line! The ride was crowded by mid morning. A train had mechanical problems that resulted in the crowded train. Once we got off the last stop, we visited the park nearby before heading to the pier.I would describe the Pier as being like Pier 39 in San Francisco, but scaled way down. Very Touristy which is what we expected. There were so many kiosk vendors selling exactly the same things....from hand painted landscapes on a 4x6 mirrors to your name on a banner using hand painted artistic floral/bird/colorful fonts. You can even get your name on a grain of rice! I think the carney area was ok.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AFonger
50,Buzzing and Relaxing,"So many things going on at the Pier. Musicians, Artists, Trapeze School, Food Vendors and fantastic restaurants, Rides, the ocean waves, the sunset, and more. We'll visit again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L9590NIjulied
50,Very dog friendly,"We went to meet up with some friends on our drive through California coming down from Alaska. We had our 2 dogs with is and we did not plan on taking them with us on the actual pier. We have monitored autostart, and it was December, and not overly warm, so we planned on leaving our dogs in the vehicle with air conditioner running. However the parking attendants/valet refused to let us leave the dogs. I guess it's the law no matter the weather conditions. So we nervously headed toward the pier with our 2 kids and 3 dogs (1 of which does suffer from social anxiety). The walk from the paring structures were a little far but mainly downhill which was fine.I was pleasantly surprised by how incredibly friendly everyone was. There were thousands of people and I think most of them stopped to talk with us and pet our 3 dogs. I have never seen such an eclectic mix of people from literally all over the world. We didn't come across 1 rude or impatient person the whole day. Even when our little dog slipped his collar and was running all over the place. People were running all over the deck trying to help catch him. It was pretty funny to watch. And I was so grateful that people were kind and understanding.My kids had so much fun at the arcade which was so crowded it seemed to almost burst at the seams.The only negative thing we faced was one of our pork tamales from a pier vendor was green with rot and mold. We didn't let it ruin our day and just ended up tossing it and not causing a fuss.As we headed back across the bridge we realized we now had to walk up hill. I'm not a fan of inclines and I'm not in very good shape. So it was a bit difficult because there were so many people in front of and behind us, we were unable to stop and catch our breath. Even my husband who is a mountain climber said it was a bit difficult to maneuver with so many people going at all different speeds. Obviously the main issues with the speed was that we had the 3 dogs and 2 little kids that we had to keep up with. We finally made it to the top and I felt a wonderful sense of personal accomplishment. I would totally do it again. Although maybe next time without the dogs.To top off our wonderful visit to the pier, we got to see the most amazing bright orange, pink and red west coast sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nsgrahl
10,"Looks great, but don't spend your money","I spent $22 on Santa Monica pier, and for the most part was ripped off. Here's my itemised review:Busker - $2. There was a guy playing classical guitar, he was providing a lovely musical background so I gave the kids $1 each to tip him. Very good value in my view.Magnet - $5. Buying magnets at every stop for some friends back home. They're all a bit pricey, this one no different, but on par for value.Attraction, Basketball - $5. 3 shots at a basketball hoop costing $5. Expensive and poor value, but clearly advertised and very obvious what was on offer. No upset.Attraction - Waterfun Pacific Park (water pistol aiming game) - $10. Both kids played this (ie $5 each), it lasted 4 seconds - I am not exaggerating!!! The guy attending this (William) just shrugged when challenged. It's exactly this sort of attraction that gives these places such a bad rap.To the operators of this place - you should be ashamed of yourselves. Earlier in the day we rode bikes to Muscle Beach where we were able to borrow (ie free!!!!) basketballs and play basketball FOR FREE. To then spend $15 on attractions that lasted less than a minute was disgraceful.To other visitors - the pier looks lovely, has a great carnival feel - but my advice is to look at it, take your photos, enjoy the feeling, but keep your money in your pockets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colebatchd

50,Family fun at the beach,"The Santa Monica Pier is a great place for the whole family or just for one. There's Pacific Park which has a Ferris wheel, roller coaster and all kinds of games to play. Bubba Gump's restaurant is on the Pier along with other eateries from pizza to ice cream. You can fish or just walk along the Pier. Downtown Santa Monica is just blocks away with the mall and 3rd Street Promenade for great shopping. You can park at the mall, on the beach or take the Expo train that let's you off two blocks from the beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jeane141
40,Santa Monica Pier fun for all,"Santa Monica its a must do ! It might feel a bit tacky at first but once you get in the swing of thing you'll have fun . Easy Restaurants ( I loved retro' 60s Rubys - the same that's on Huntington beach pier ) and great choice of food vendors , Giant Ferris Wheel offers amazing views and pictures opportunity. It's a great spot for kids, couples and the whole family. Saturday nights are crowded , it better to go week days .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrissie_M2000

30,"Santa Monica Pier, Pacific Park","Not a bad place for family fun & food. I walked there from my hotel one evening. The beach is nicely paved, lots of activities going on. It was this month in June and I was wearing my winter jacket. Breezy, so dress appropriately. Not a huge amusement center, but it's a pier...only so much space. I wanted to take a nice sunset pictures of the beach, but it wasn't as dramatic as I was hoping for. If my family was with me, I would have done some rides & games. But I just went to take a few pictures and see it for the first time. Enjoyed the peaceful walk there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/480alanw

50,PERFECT!,"Loved the pier, extremely live with good restaurants and great places to take pictures! The Ferris wheel is great and many good vendors with nice vacation tshirts and many singers and actors that are very friendly and entertaining!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/648elisem
50,Santa Monica Pier/ Rodeo Drive/Venice Beach,"Rather than be rushed place to place with a guide and pay $795 for 6 hrs We took an Uber from universal studio city to Santa Monica Pier, walked to third street promenade, had a look at the shops and then walked down past the beach houses to Venice Beach / Muscle Beach then Uber to Rodeo Drive then walked through Beverly Hills to get to West Hollywood. Saw SUR and PUMP (going back to PUMP for dinner, stunning ! And great menu) then bus/walk to The Grove / Farmers Market for dinner then Uber back to universal. Brilliant day saw loads and Uber is definitely the way to get around and pick up great ideas from the locals. Make sure you wear your good walking shoes though !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/105becp
40,It's an icon: bit tacky but a must do,"There are some things that you must do when you are in certain places: go to the Eiffel Tower when in Paris is one. Visiting the pier in Santa Monica isn't quite in the same league, but why would you come to Santa Monica and not got to the pier. This is the end of Route 66, an important piece of legend in the American story. It's also where Forrest Gump turned around on his runs across the country (although there is no market for that). The fun park is traditional stuff - which is not a criticism and the ferris wheel is solar powered. You can read about the pier's gangster past where the DA, one Earl Warren (later Chief Justice) went after mobster Tony 'the hat'. Lots of T shirts and souvenirs of various levels of tackiness, and restaurants and takeaways of varying quality, but even after all of that, it's still worth a visit to say you have been there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnSB3
50,Santa Monica Pier,"Great view of the coast. Had fun walking the pier, lots of shops for souvenirs. The pier also has a small amusement park with Ferris wheel and roller coaster. Bubba Gump shrimp co is also on the pier!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meyers96
40,Worth a look,"Good atmosphere, good views of beach, good buskers ensure a good time. Did not eat here although there was plenty of options available. Bubba Gumps was popular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travrainbow
50,Merry-go-around on Pacific sunset,We visited the Pier on a very hot day where the only refreshment was the cool ocean water. It is lovely to watch the people having fun at the beach.We rode the roller coaster with my 9 year old son and it was the first time for him. I thought he would be afraid but the coaster was gentle so I recommend it to other kids who are weary of roller coasters.We even had the opportunity to see a live Seal of the ocean. It was such fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Helluva_party
50,Gorgeous,"Such a gorgeous site, so beautiful. This was the best part of our trip. Great food, entertainment, and view. Its a must see on any trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ginson22
50,Santa Monica Pier,"If you visit Santa Monica, you must visit the pier! Took our sons twenty years ago and always remember the big wheel and all the attractions. There is something special about this pier as it is featured in so many films and tv series. Set on a great beach with eateries such as bubba gump and lots of side stalls selling the usual summer souvenirs. It's a long pier and a great walk to see the beauty of both sides of the beach and beyond. The main entrance with its iconic 50's style illuminated sign, is the gateway to so much fun for all the family. It's a special place for all our family so a must see for us!Just visited last month and nothing's changed, still the great place it always was!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suewoody23
50,So much to do!,"Lots of restaurants, an amusement park, double decker pier...love it!! Local artists sing and sell crafts. Beware of the beggars.... and plan to be stuck in traffic and spend 40 mins finding parking....just a fact of life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melissa1983l
30,Typical Pier,"The pier was fun - typical carnival/beach theme. Lots of people fishing, trinket shopping, playing games. The beach gets super crowded so get there early. Parking is $12 for the day. If you have time, rent a bike (7$) and bike on the trail - you will see people and things from all walks of life!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taylorg287
50,"Crowded, but fun.","We had a very nice family day. It was crowded, but fun. Our small grandchildren ran around and played and went to the beach. There was also food for all. Just a fun outing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmsflorence
50,Quick trip to the pier,Lovely. Excellent for kids and lovely views of the beach.Lovely post cards and tourist stalls for little bracelets.We started our walk to Venice beach from here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichelleScotland15
20,Nothing much to see... Kind of disappointing,The third street promenade was better. Some of the restaurants on the pier are good. If you have little kids the rides are good for them. But not much for teenagers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/403darlenen
20,Fair closed for private function,Rode my 5 year old daughter to the pier on a tag along bike. Fairly easy parking. Odd scene of lots of people swimming in front of a sign that said 'no swimming due to bacteria levels that exceed health standards'. There wasn't much for us among the attractions on the pier. We had hoped to go on the Ferris wheel but that whole section was closed for a private function. The pier itself is an awesome construction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Banambirr
50,Fun place for the family!,My visit to Santa Monica Pier was exciting! The pier was clean and trash free. Plenty of entertainment there from rides on the pier to enjoying the beach. One thing that stuck out to our family was a man who made sculptures of people by hand for very inexpensive $15. The rides were pretty cool too. Its a Fair themed type event. We enjoyed the fruit in a cup and dips. We will be back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erniet2016
30,A fun waste of a couple hours and a landmark worth visiting.,"Me and my LA man frequently will go down to the pier to play at the video arcade. It's definitely a tourist trap. But with that said, I wouldn't skip it while in town for a first time visit. There is access to the beach as well. It is an iconic California landmark. Go see it. If you have kids, they will enjoy it immensely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Valogreeneyez
50,$12 per day convenient parking next to the beach and pier,"Someone asked about parking a while back. The closest one is next to the beach, a huge parking lot for $12 the whole day. Get early to get prime space. Easy access to beach and world famous pier. Just make sure you know how to get there, just underneath the pier, because the 2-way lane can be quite tricky due to the fast traffic on the roads.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Draxxzo
30,"Been there, done that","Good place for people watching & tourist shops. If you have children & they like roller coasters and the like, then this is a great place for the family. We do not do rides, but they looked in good repair & people were enjoying themselves. We did not eat on the pier, but there are plenty of choices. We did catch a small car show & some clubs having paddle board & surf board races which were fun to watch. One can do some fishing from the end of the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/micheles955
40,Fun Tourist Stop,The pier is bustling with people and shops. It was a nice way to spend a morning and have lunch. The views are amazing! Check out Muscle Beach right next to the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeyKell
50,The end of Route 66.,"We stopped at the Santa Monica Pier as it was the symbolic end of our Route 66 trip. We arrived on a Saturday evening and it was very busy. There are plenty of opportunities for souvenirs, lots of rides and snacks. The snacks are expensive. We were able to take our picture next to the Route 66 sign and speaks with Ian at the Route 66 booth. He was a great guy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Salamanca208
10,Not what you may expect if you want to enjoy a beach,"Very crowded...avoid parking just right before you get to the pier, I made this mistake and the park was very expensive 30dls, complete rip off. If you just want to go for a walk is fine but you may decide to walk along the corniche. We love bubba gump and we had lunch at the pier, just make sure you know what the drinks you are ordering...you may end up paying double the price of your bill with souvenir glasses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rafamar
30,Iconic but...,So it's a landmark that one should check out but honestly that's about it. There's a midway with kiddie rides and overpriced food outlets. The best part is that it's on a nice stretch of beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/giantsindahouse
40,WHAT A GREAT WAY TO SPEND A COUPLE OF HOURS,we thought this would just be a half hour stroll it ended up beingnearly 4 hours joyrides a little souvenir shopping and them some dinner what a great little place wish I had the kids,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/188gaskillstreet

40,"Lot of fun and options, can be crowded","This central attraction of Santa Monica has something for everyone, with restaurants, rides and other attractions. It can be quite crowded and chaotic on the weekends though. Good for people watching",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonyh120
30,Fun Way to Spend an Afternoon!,"Santa Monica Pier is a great place to spend an afternoon when in the Los Angeles area. With fun amusement park rides, arcade games, several places to eat, and a long stretch of California beach right next door you can't go wrong spending a few hours here with your kids on a sunny afternoon. You can often find discount tickets to the amusement park rides if you search online and plan ahead. Although Santa Monica Beach is often crowded, the added diversity it offers with the nearby rides, restaurants (Bubba Gumps and other nearby eateries) and shopping (just a block away from the beach) make it a really nice destination spot for a few hours or an entire day. I would definitely recommend Santa Monica Pier for a family outing with a variety of things to do close at hand.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanw921
30,Santa Monica crowded pier,Nice area but extremely crowded. Nice for picture taking but that is about it. There are lots of places to eat but make reservations,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodneyd844

50,Great place for a walk on a pier and sightseeing,"While vacationing in Los Angeles we took our daughter and her friend to this beach while my husband and I walked the pier. Has great view of the coast, lots of little shops and Rout 66 info. This is the end of Rout 66 and has a map from Chicago to Santa Monica pier. Has an amusement park for kids of all ages. Buy a wrist band to wear to get on all the rides. Plenty of little eateries and typical gift shops. Great place to bri g the kids both day and evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimM67

50,"Great, fun place","We went to the beach this morning here and arrived around 10:30am which was a good time. It got VERY busy around 1-2p. They had good parking, a nice beach, a nice pier with lots to do, a bike trail around the beach which we did with 3 young children. Great day Activity with kids",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MLS2013
50,Lots to do in a small space,"Santa Momica Pier is worth visiting. It attracts a lot of people and seems very crowded. However, it is still easy to get around and do things without waiting too long in lines. The restrooms are accessible and clean. The views are great, especially from atop the ferris wheel.Parking can be tough but if you drive around the area, you should be able to find a meter. If you are only staying an hour of two a meter should work fine. The public parking lot is usually full.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daverich
50,Just as expected,"Santa Monica Pier just simply a good place to go, take photos of sunset, have a burger and just have fun.Close to shops and lots of food outletsNice to see diversity of people basking, doing magic tricks and just enjoying a day out",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thefloralmcgyver
40,Beautiful,"I loved the shops and musicians.Only thing is they don't allow single persons entry to the ferris wheel ride which was a shame, because I am a solo traveller and going on that ride was the main reason I wanted to go to the pier lol",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeatherS2141
40,Best touristy beach,I love this beach. There are so many great places to just sit and enjoy the sand and surf. A great place for people watching and kite flying. Clean with a playground for kids and on for adults too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunriseut
30,Cool place but the action is at the Pacific Park which is ON the pier.,This is an iconic location but there are a TON of people AND it doesn't have as easy an access or departure as I would have liked. We went primarily because of the Pacific Park theme park located ON the pier. The pier is free but the Park is a charge for the rides.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/douglaspahl
50,Great day out,Caught the train to the pier. Great idea as parking is quite $$$ down that way. The pier was busy. Lots to do or just sit in the beach and enjoy the sunshine,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Madjude
30,A bit too touristy,"The pier is a nice walk, some restaurants and shops on each side, you can enjoy z nice view of the surrounding beaches..it gets very crowded and most the attractions feel very touristy.

40,One Sexy Beach!,"Every time I travel to California on business, I stop at the pier either at the beginning of my trip, or right before I leave the state. It's just so much fun. So many things to do and places to shop and sight see. Not to mention that Bubba Gump is right there so even a decent place to eat.This a nice place to take your kids for rides too. Walks in the evenings are worth it. The sunset is quite beautiful at that time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/napiest
50,Loads of fun,Awesome day trip here. It wasn't the best weather it being overcast but did not take away from the buzz of how fun this place is. Interesting walk to the end with a gorgeous view looking back across the the pier and beach. We went on a couple of rides and didn't have to wait long which is always great. Also went into the arcade and this is so much fun for everyone of all ages. Won a few tickets and the guy gave us more prizes to choose from too.

50,Route 66 End of the Trail,"Lots of activity on the pier. Restaurants, shops, excursion booths, and amusement park.

40,Wonderful time in LA,"Had a wonderful time at the Santa Monica Beach and pier. A beautiful merry go ride was the first eye catching sight.

40,Little tacky but the sunset there is beautiful,"Take a walk along the beach, watch the seals and fishermen. The restaurants are overly expensive and not worth it I think. During the day it's really crowded there, so go early in the morning or later in the evening. The Ferris wheel and entertainment is little bit tacky but I guess belongs to the feel of this place. Interesting fact is that Santa Monica Pier is the end of the famous Route 66 that goes across US.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/articok

30,Very touristy,The old pier has been renovated after some huge storms in 1983 I think. It's getting rather dated now. Some good and not so good street entertains were the highlight really,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rossh494
50,Foggy days still fun,"Parking was jam packed but I appreciate tge culture and things to keep busy doing. Its a must visit if in the area.

40,Quaint old pier,This is a lovely place to visit the pier is nothing special but the beach is long and golden sands.We ate at one of the food vans parked in the main road just at the end of the pier & it cost $8.00 for 2 lovely bacon wrapped freshly cooked hot dogs you add your own topping(s).All in all good for a visit but not sure if I would stay too long.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/242PaulM
30,Hard to get a beer but fun all the same,"We walked along the beach at Santa Monica and towards the pier / fun fair. It was a long walk and so refreshments were in order. There was lots to do but only two places served alcohol (Bubba Gumps and a restaraunt at the end of pier). The local tv news was also filming live the day we came. Lots of ""performers"" on the pier. Hold on to your wallets!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/harber1978
30,Santa Monica Pier,"Is good to see but a bit over rated and expensive so, very tourist oriented and I would say be careful what you buy as there are many more places with the same stuff for a lot less than buying them from the Pier..

50,The start of route 66...,"The pier is the start of route 66, it's fun all day long, parking same as other beaches. Check with city for times of operation for the ferris wheel if interested in this attraction because is not open all the time. Shops. Restaurants and restrooms accesible. Actual pier is open all nigth but not most shops live music sometimes, fun, fun, fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sndunga
20,Overcrowded and Uninteresting,"Santa Monica Pier is one of the world's most famous, appearing in many Hollywood movies and other media. This is why we made it a priority to come here even before the famous beaches in the area.All in all, there was nothing interesting here at all. There was a small fair (I think it's permanent, with the ferris wheel and all) that looked low-end from up-close (not to mention overpriced), and even on the pier itself there was nothing to do, but for some reason a huge crowd of people.The only thing I found nice here was looking out into the ocean: the end of the pier was much less crowded, and constituted a very nice place for ocean gazing—but how long can you look at the horizon? Not worth coming just for that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ynhockey
50,Fun at Santa Monica pier,"The pier has great restaurants and you can fish, there are rides,arcade center for families and a beautiful view of the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Balach88
40,Great For The Whole Family,"Our family chose Santa Monica Pier due to all of the lovely reviews saying it is the best family beach in California that was within reach. We arrived around 9:30am and found the pier teeming with life. Aside from the various shops and activities, there were a few side performers that caught our eye. It was a perfect rounded environment and addition to the beach for a family to enjoy their day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debberaa
30,Old and needs a facelift but worth checking out,"It's nothing like the pictures.... Very old and run down and the day we visited the smog was incredibly bad. The highlight is the bike ride from Santa Monica to Venice beach.... definitely worth doing. The bike shop under the pier is the best and it will cost around $20 for the day or $5 for an hour. Great fun, easy ride and worth doing...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H8934VTmarias
50,Fun for All!!,"Very enjoyable time for all at the Santa Monica Pier, Pacific Ocean Park. Great venues for young to old as well as the walk along the pier as you enjoy the ocean views, fisherman, carnival lights, street entertainers & dining facilities. Again Fun for All is to be had at the Santa Monica Pier and Pacific Ocean Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V4888OJdanielb
30,Just went for a walk,"We didn't really have a go on any of the rides or eat at the restaurants, just passing through. Seemed like a really nice place though and had a good vibe!Busy though!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maddylucya
50,Fun,"Fun, active pier! Nice shopping and places to eat or get a snack. Buy a amusment ticket and ride the ferris wheel. Beautiful views. Take a barefoot stroll in the sand and go under the pier to see the structure, and how the waves encircle it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0601sonjab
40,nice time,We took our grandchildren to the pier this past weekend. they loved it and found a great street guy doing a magic show. The food was ok also.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scott92
50,Viva las vegas,Amazing amazing amazing. Just full of character and charm and lights and atmosphere and a fab ambience that at night becomes a mecca for all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcandLauraB
40,Fantastic afternoon,"The Pier is very fun and entertaining for everyone. They have music, comfort food, rides, pets, etc. The price for the attractions is very good so you could definitely make an evening or an afternoon out of this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daivira
40,A sight to see,"I walked from the Venice beach boardwalk to the Santa Monica pier and Pacific park. A beautiful seaside view and great atmosphere. Food is pricey on the peer, but it's worth the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/racheld530
30,Typical family seaside entertainment,Finished a Route 66 trip at the pier.A great finale to a long iconic trip.Large pier offering lots of typical seaside entertainment for all the family. All reasonably maintained and clean. Felt safe at all times.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Les-n-Trace
50,Extra Lovely in the winter,"Beautiful piece of the seaside community preserved as a new gem for others to come. There aren't many these piers left, and certainly not more than 140 of these old merry go rounds. Bonus, it's only $1 for kids to ride.It's worth the visit, not crowded in the morning but it gets very busy in the afternoon. Gorgeous sunsets!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coaticook
40,Good to see,"If the weather was better would be nicer,...had a good meal at bubba gumps and learnt to share a meal... Huge serving sizes.. Nice walk along the pier lots to see and listen too ..lots of photo ops would have loved to have seen the sunset but another time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G4439CWsharonm
50,I live in L.A. but this is only the third time I've visited the Santa Monica Pier,"Since the L.A. Metro, as of May 20th, extends to Santa Monica, I gave that a try rather than driving. It's an excellent tourist spot. At the terminus of the rail line is Santa Monica Pier, Muscle Beach, Santa Monica Place and the 3rd Street Promenade. Enough to keep a tourist busy all day. Although L.A.'s rail system is minimal compared to other areas, you can now travel fairly easily between Santa Monica, Downtown, Pasadena, Hollywood and Universal City Studios. For a tourist, these are some good destinations, although if you're only going to be in L.A. for a short period, I do recommend doing a tour. L.A. is just too spread out, and is easy to get lost.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Burgerwars
50,Pretty,The pier looks exactly like you could imagine it. Even if it's a bit crowded in the afternoon and during the evening. It still is a nice place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/679lauriep
50,Love this place!,"This is a must do if you are visiting LA! It's a short drive to have loads of fun! We went on a weekday during the day to help,with finding parking. We found street parking at Palisades Park and paid $5 to park 3 hours. Beautiful walk to the pier. We spent a few hours walking the boardwalk, playing some games, and eating snow cones. View is gorgeous of the beach and ocean!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrscichon
50,Fun day out,Some really good food vendors and rides. Its not the biggest theme park but it has some good rides at some decent prices. Is also the location of where Sharknado was filmed if thats your thing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leyshao
50,ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL,"The view from the ferris wheel was absolutely magnificent. The pier looks just like straight out from GTA V. It was a cold day so everything was great. A lot of people, but adds to the liveliness of the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/395jasone
30,Looks pretty at night,"The pier is a Santa Monica/LA icon. Personally, I wouldn't waste my time. There are some nice photo ops with the Santa Monica shoreline in the background. All and all its just kind of a tacky place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CynWhite
30,Interesting and just Okay,"A true California experience. We have always been interested in checking out this pier made famous in so many movies.  We walked here from Venice Beach along the boardwalk/ promenade.  Upon arrival at the pier we realized it's a big amusement park with a sprinkling of shops and restaurants thrown in.  Not a disappointment as the views off the pier are gorgeous and the ""people-watching"" was world class.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoAnnW57
50,nice icon of LA,"Can't go to LA without a trip to Santa Monica and walk along the pier, great atmosphere with buskers everywhere playing quality music.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodh710
40,Fun place to people watch,We visited one busy holiday weekend and enjoyed it. The parking garages were expensive at $30 per car so find a parking spot along the street if possible. Plenty of places to eat and walk around and a few to sit and have dinner like we did at Bubba Gump Shrimp Company.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kloverfield
50,Busy weekend place,"Great place to be there on weekends, lots to do and watch with children. Lot of activities and shows. Do not miss the skate board arena which is treat to watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ask99
50,Colourful funfair atmosphere.,Hustle and bustle and full of day trippers and families enjoying the sunshine and with a clean sandy beach close by.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IanMac555
30,Sketchy Place,"An OK place to visit once. I felt a little uncomfortable the the late evening rush to exit the pier just before nightfall, some interesting folk who were loud an rude sort of spoiled the famous ""vibe"" for us. To be honest I questioned our safety a few times while making our way back to the expensive parking garage at that time of evening. Go during the day and get out of there before late evening and you should be fine. Not to be all negative though, there were great views and good food to be had.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I7307ZLjamesr
50,Santa Monica pier,"Just as I thought it would be, big, old, bustling, fun.We visited on a weekday and it was so busy, so many people, great atmosphere, great views of the beach and ocean.Went to the end of Route66, fabulous shop and lots of memorabilia. Lots of buskers entertaining the crowds.Well worth doing the touristy thing and going to Santa Monica pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kgarwood27
10,Yuck,Went at 9 pm to Bubba Gump and the pier was crawling with drunks and tweeking people everywhere! It seemed very unsafe and uncomfortable. The food was mediocre at best. We will not return and do NOT recommend taking children... $18 to park and the beach smelled like weed and urine.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VanessaL974
50,Summer Nights,"Ive gone to Santa Monica Beach couple of times now, & its always a nice time when i go. Even to walk the peir & walk the beach is nice.Summer nights are always packed with people & full with good vibes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jovany909
50,Striking Colors & Silohouette At Sunset,"From our terrace at the JW Marriott Le Merigot in Santa Monica, the Santa Monica Pier is a striking silhouette of curves and lines against a brilliant backdrop of colored patterns created by the clouds. Amazing and romantic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tjcnewyork
30,"Worth a small walk and a ride or two, but thats it","This is probably something you should do if you have kids, but just for a bit - you'll drop $40 for a few rides, but by and large its a pretty average experience. Lots of people and nothing healthy at all to eat or drink. The crowd is, um, interesting to say the least.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngusRodrigo
50,I MISS THE BEACH,So many activities and shops. Very Clean. All the shops were visited were run by great people. The pier has several different areas for viewing or accessing the ocean. The Ferris wheel was our favorite spot! We were fortunate enough to see a seal!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jvarner317
50,Lovely experience,It was lovely walking along the pier taking in views across the Pacific. Lots of nice foods to eat from candy floss to full meals. A must do f your in Santa Monica,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PJJK
50,Watch out for oil patches!,"Very beautiful place with lots of interesting things to see and people to watch :) We enjoyed the beach however, BE AWARE! Everyone in our group walked away with oil/tar patches stuck to our feet. And when I say stuck, it was awful. We came away with a higher sense of global warming and what we are doing to our environment when everyone is walking around with tissue stuck to the bottom of their foot just so their foot doesn't get stuck to their shoe. With a lot of scratching, picking and rubbing and 3 days later, it was all gone. Just BEWARE of your children getting this on their bodies, as we were all adults and thought we had avoided the black spots.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenGo4
50,"Sunshine, beaches, and the Cali Experience","Absolutely gorgeous day for us. This was the first place we went after we arrived in California on our trip. The pier atmosphere was great. There were lots of performers around (some good, some bad, some horrible), lots of vendors with food, free samples, fishermen, and the carnival area. My students were super excited to see everything. Lunch at the Pier Burger was also exceptional. The beach is a quick walk away off the boardwalk in addition to a mall/shopping area as well. A great way to spend a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewbmusic
50,Good place to kill an hour or so,"Took the kids on a Wednesday morning, very easy to find parking on the pier, and crowd was light. I had a 12 and 7 year old with me and they played a few games along the boardwalk but weren't interested in the rides. We walked down the pier, and spend a majority of our day playing in the water. Although it was overcast, it was really warm outside. Loved that the beach was not crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/momof4kidz
50,Loved it,Really enjoyed it the best bit of LA by far. The beach was outstanding. If I was going back to LA I would definitely stay closer to here. Great places to eat as well,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/64wesleyh
30,Worth a ten minute walk to see it...once.,"It is one of those things you see in photos and movies. So we went expecting it to be an entertaining experience. It is kinda of like a forever carnival in feel. dirty, strange vendors and stores selling cheap trinkets for the willing tourist. Wanna be Singers every 50 yards asking for donations or to sell their ""CD's"". If you go to Santa Monica take ten to fifteen minutes and walk the pier. Then go to the actual beach or on the walking path and enjoy the rest of your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J9359ATmarkd
50,A great pier,I we loved Santa Monica it has an amazing beach next to the pier very clean with lifeguards all along the beach.The pier is great attractions restaurants and a great atmosphereThere is a pedestrian area for shopping outside with great variety of shops we even found a small sweet shop selling uk chocolate and sweets can't wait to go back amazing place would recommend a visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WilliamIreland
50,Metro Exposition Line to the Pier,"I've been driving all over L.A. for many years and used to visit S.M. regularly. But traffic is so bad that I hadn't been for a long time. When the Expo opened a couple of weeks ago I decided to give it a try. What a pleasant experience. From Pasadena to SM there were Sheriffs at each station, thus no unpleasant passengers or trouble. I discoveered that the beach area was cleaner than it was the last time I was there with a wooden walkway to the water. Restaurant offerings have changed for the better as well. It's only three blocks from the station to the pier through a pleasant area of stores, restaurants, and a complex that houses a museum, I discovered today. What a treat for freeway-weary commuters and tourists!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meredit
30,Cool place just very overcrowded,"If you go to LA you have to see this landmark, issue is, realize everyone else wants to do so too. It is very full in the afternoons and can get a little sketchy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Avyinc
50,A Happening Place,"I had not been to the pier since 2006, so for my husband's birthday, we took a trip to Southern California now that we live in the west.It was a Friday afternoon in October, 2015, and it was busy. We were able to find parking right by the entrance. It was so much fun to spend the afternoon people watching, having a nice dinner, and seeing the sun set over the Pacific.This is a great place to let go and get away from the hustle and bustle of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RickMilw
50,Epic Fun,"Took our 4 year old here and had a blast, good selection of games and rides. Good place to kill a hour or so with some good eating places on the pier as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RMMNZL
50,Tourist Attraction,We went here on our first day in Santa Monica. It was super packed but we had fun looking around and enjoying the views. The fresh fruit served along the pier was phenomenal and not expensive at all. It's worth just the walk around and to say you have been there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicoleT89_89
50,Super fun place,The pier is great place to chill with family.We went in the evening and it was buzzing. We ate at Bubba Gump.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nilima1232014

20,Afternoon visit,We visited on a Tuesday afternoon. Even with a thick marine layer and cool temperatures it was very busy. We had to park quite a distance away. Been here before just as a couple. Didn't feel really safe with my family. Lots of homeless and vagrants. Dirty. Don't need to come back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Runnergirlx2

30,Tourist trap,"Quite nice but this is a real tourist trap. Really busy, go early to avoid the crowds. Watch people fishing off the end of the pier",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stellasdad
50,Solar-Powered Ferris Wheel!,"Gaze at the Pacific Ocean from a 130-foot Ferris wheel, powered by the sun! The view is spectacular, and is well worth the $8 ticket price. Hungry? The Albright, named for the nautical Albright Knot (fun fact!) serves up a good ""Shrimp Po' Boy Sandwich"" (ask for extra sauce on the side) and craft beer in a laid-back atmosphere. And just shy of the Pier, is where Route 66 ends; great picture-taking opportunity!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/891tameras
40,Fun,"It's nice, but it's a pier....The ocean is beautifully blue, and the variety of people was amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nomad581019
30,Fun for a few hours,We took our grandson there after visiting a few other area attractions. He loved the arcade (who doesn't?).The weather was fabulous as usual and it made for a fun few hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/955stasis
40,Over the top but fun,"It has the feel of a typical fair, only you're on a pier and the ocean and mountains act as a backdrop. The rides personally didn't interest me at all, but the energy was good and I thought it was worth checking out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardsmyname
50,Go early,"We were there early in the morning before all the crowd. Neat place to visit, the end of Route 66. We did not do any of the carnival rides but would be fun for children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesl162
50,First Family trip,Took our 4 month old over to the states for her first trip. She absolutely loved the trip to the pier. The sounds and sights were good to keep her amused. A great place for a family outing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Johnno454

50,A Must Go While in Los Angeles,"The Santa Monica Pier is a must visit for any tourist coming to Los Angeles. It is a long pier at Santa Monica Beach, right next to Palisades Park. The Pier has rides and a really cool old carousel (the one in the movie The Sting with Robert Redford). You can get a wrist band for the rides at about 29$. The Carousel is a separate price.The Pier is fun day or night. If you are here in the winter the rides are likely not open on the week nights.There is a ton to do right at the Pier. There are the fun rides, a game area with all the latest video games, there is cheap eats and a couple great restaurants.You will park under the Pier and there is a fee. You can walk from your car to the beach and the waves or up the stairs to the Pier. If you feel like walking Palisades Park is right next door and the view of the beach is wonderful.While you are there, your wallet will be in your front pocket. But don't worry, it is safe, there is a police presence. Please do not give money to the homeless there--ya, sounds cold--but you are just feeding their drug habit and Santa Monica has many places for food and shelter for the homeless.Have the best time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
40,Road Warriors this is the end of Route 66,"We have traveled 3300 miles in 3 weeks (Route 66 + few detours). It was an amazing trip and we would do it all over again. When we arrived to Santa Monica it took us many hours in bumper to bumper traffic to get to the famous Pier, where we wanted to take a photo with the End of Route 66 sign. Unfortunately, as it was a Saturday evening and the amount of traffic and no parking spaces were incredible, we have walked there from our hotel on a Sunday morning and then we took the victorious pictures with both signs (one on the Pier, and the original one by the Visitors Centre booth). The Pier itself is very nice, the last Route 66 shop is definitely worth a visit. Beautiful vast beach. As we visited in May it wasn't too crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VioletTrips
50,Great December day!,A day at Santa Monica Pier was one of the best activities for my 11-year old daughter and me. We did all the rides at the amusement park. We visited the aquarium and had a delicious lunch. We would definitely go back with Dad and brother next time we go to LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O60YQanac
40,Cool Tourist Spot,"My bestie and I stopped by here Friday night around 9pm. (We wanted to make sure we crossed it off the list. lol) There were a lot of little shops, street performers, and people doing caricatures and even a clay bust of your face!(that was cool!) There's an arcade, a ferris wheel, and other rides. If you go at night wear a jacket and sneakers, it gets really cold. My friend had to buy a $45 sweatshirt because she was so cold, and she had on a light blue jean jacket!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/305kiras
40,Good day out if you have kids,The pier has a few resturants that are usually very busy.The theme park has a few good ride for the kids.And you get a great view of the beaches in both directions.Also the start or end point for the route 66 travellers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ingy56

Limited dining options but I'm sure you can find one that suits your budget.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rowan548
50,Great day out,"Everyone of us had a great afternoon at the Pier. Watching people, making our pic in the photo booth - lunch at Albrights. The next time we came we had dinner at an Italian restaurant on the 2 floor- seemed a bit odd at first but the food was great. It is on the left as you are at the start of the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Such_a_city_girl
50,Lived up to the hype,We had some great nights at the pier. Being from England we had some high expectations of the pier. We particularly liked Rusty's bar. The staff were helpful and views spectacular.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SamA2008
40,Fun day,The pier was fun. We got there early so we're able to park with ease and walk and enjoy the boardwalk before the crowd arrived. Wish we had brought our children on this trip because they would have enjoyed it. We were glad there was easy beach access.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brittly

40,Interesting historic pier,"This is a nice wooden pier with a sound heritage and lots to do and see. There are amusements, cafes and shops to wander round as well as on the pier parking. There is also the end of the historic Route 66 sign which is a very popular photographic point. It has various historic signage with history of the beach and the pier. An interesting place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bfmcm
40,Great place to hang out,"We went here twice - once in the rain, the other in sunshine. Don't go in the rain, its not worth it (luckily on our last day the sun came out!) The pier has lots of little stalls, eateries and rides. The beach is beautiful and a nice place to hang out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauraswanderlust
40,Santa Monica to Venice Beach,"We started of from the Santa Monica Pier where we hired push bikes to ride up to Venice Beach. The pier is good to walk along to see the side shows, shops but gets very crowded. To ride to Venice only takes around 20 mins along the beach, you get to see the original muscle beach where Arnie started of. Good little ride and you can take your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/790davem

40,Fun diversion from the beach,"The iconic outline of the Santa Monica Pier beckoned to us as we walked up the beach after a day walking up and down the boardwalk to Venice.On the Pier, we people-watched while walking to the end past buskers and finger-painting artists, collecting pennies from the machines in the arcade and small amusement park. We had already had a full day, so didn’t linger long, but the pier was clearly a favorite of families, fisher-folk, buskers, locals, and tourists alike.This is a fun place to while away an afternoon, or to end your day with dinner at Bubba Gumps or another of the pier-side restaurants. Bring your change, whether it be for the pennies, the arcade, or the buskers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dunadan
50,Great day out!,"If you're able to go, then do! Had a great sunny day here on the pier and walking along the beach. Weren't able to go further into town, due to timings. But would definitely recommend to spend the $8 and go on the Ferris wheel!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G4546CMalexn

30,Tourist Hotspot,Santa Monica is beautiful but the pier is typical. Crowded on a Thursday afternoon. We spent about 10 minutes walking around. Paid $12 for parking. Lunch was good at the pizza place near the entrance. We enjoyed walking and more time on the boardwalk more than the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TAB_VA
40,Great time at the pier.,"Visited the pier late afternoon to evening in April. Weather was pleasant got a little windy.

30,USA road trip,"Stayed in Santa Monica for one night only on our way to LA.Had a lovely main shopping area, as well as streets with lots of different shops too. Good for eating and drinking.Didn't really rate the pier, a lot like Blackpool in America, full of unlikely characters, felt a little unnerving at times. Very expensive for drinks and snacks. A lot nicer to see from a distance as opposed to close up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeveWestYorks

Santa Monica pier takes my breath away. If you wanna take a breath, there is best choice for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/duygui2016
30,Quaint place but fix the street entertainment,"An interesting combination of eateries. It's worth a visit for the view but they really need to tidy up the buskers. From reasonable entertainment to some old guy with mismatched gloves that simply stands there wobbling to bad music, without a word except for the almost illegible hand written sign begging for tips despite a complete lack of talent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanDHam
50,Fun afternoon !,Great way to pass the time with lots of things for kids to do of all ages ! We did the Ferris wheel (great views ) and the roller coaster !

50,Exactly what a pier should be,"We live by the sea and have a poor excuse for a pier, which no doubt was once great. Santa Monica pier shows exactly what can be done, including parking cars on the pier ! There is a small theme park for the kids and lots of different options to eat and drink. Most importantly there are fabulous views of the beach, which itself is immaculate. If it weren't so far away we would come back here again and again !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Walneyhammer

50,End of Route 66!,"The famous Santa Monica pier, said to be the end of the even more famous Route 66, stretching from Chicago to Los Angeles. There is even a sign to have a photo with. The pier itself is great for a walk along, look out at the beach that stretches for miles and browse the fair, shops and restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andy_d_c123
50,Beautiful beach great atmosphere,Stunning beach great photo opportunities. Fun fair ground and lots of music playing by live artists (remember if you take a picture of them they expect a tip!) Also sell great churros.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marieblake711
50,Nice place,"I have lived in Santa Monica for a month to study english and I walked by the pier every single day. It is such a lovely place to take a walk. Sure there is a lot of people and it's quite touristic but it is a really comforting place. Everybody there looks relaxed and happy. There is always some kind of ""crowd animation"" like a dancing crew. Piers in general are nice but this one is particular and worth the bend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marineseront
40,Full of energy,There are a lot if things to do. You can enjoy the sun and the sand and of course the water at the beach. The pier has a lot of restaurants around teeming with tourists and locals. There's just really a lot of people so be careful of your bags and purses. Kids' rides are also available but we did not get on any as my partner does not do rides lol. Get prizes on small games around which are fun and entertaining. Souvenir shops are also around where you can get LA labeled stuff. Get a great view of the sunset by making restaurant reservations ahead.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizd621
50,Continues to Improve,Fun for the entire family. This attraction just continues to improve. The Pier looks much better than I remember growing up. Prices remain reasonable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ricardof957
30,A whole new level of tacky,"Full of street performers, average artists and cheap restaurants. The only good thing there is bubba gumps shrimp restaurant and that's at the entrance/exit. If tacky is your kinda thing then this is for you. If you like the finer things in life then avoid like the plague.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M15KY
50,Best what LA has to offer.,"Spend whole day here, hire a bike to ride to Venice beach, go for rides, grab a hotdog on stick and enjoy great vibe. Amazing place to be, might get super crowded on weekends and public holidays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gulnozat2016
40,Santa Monica Pier,"The end of Route 66. This was one of the stops on the Hop On Hop off bus. It was a sunny day, but the wind chill made the 3 of us buy hoodies when we were walking on the Pier. We thought the ice cream prices were high. Had lunch from one of the food vans back on the street, that was great value.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/COOKIES8Perth
40,Nice place to take a walk,"I visited on Sunday with thousands of people there.It's so crowded. However, since I have played GTA, this place makes me feel interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Surewind
40,Pier and attractions ok but the Beach is great,The boardwalk and the pier attractions are a bit second rate carnival and the aquarium under the pier is pretty lame but the beach is gorgeous. Too bad it was windy and cool or it would have been much better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Don_Kovacs
30,Walk on the pier,Personally I did not feel safe walking on the pier at Santa Monica . There were lots of homeless people and others openly smoking drugs using a glass pipe. If you can put that aside it was interesting seeing the different things on the pier such as bubbas seafood. There were a few eating places on the pier but didn't stick around long enough to enjoy as we didn't feel safe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agt821
50,"Great views, shopping, and rec!","This is the end of route 66. Admission to the pier is free, but the theme park there is about $30. The beach is extremely popular and parking is usually full so you might be better off walking or taking a cab. There are volleyball courts set up along the beach and lots of vendors! You can buy art, clothes, beachware, postcards, etc. You can also rent equipment, but food and equipment around this area is expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TennesseePostcard
40,A classic,"It was very crowded in the evening, less crowded in the afternoon.It's a classic must see in LA, however once you've seen it you probably won't return. Charming arcade with classic games like PacMan.The restaurants are okay.You can park directly on the pier or on the nearby parking lot. Romantic at sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/597fredg
40,Nice spot to spend a few hours,"This is a good place to spend a few hours on a nice day. There are rides, restaurants, shops, great view of the beach and lots of options for people watching. Parking is very limited nearby. It's one of those places where you have to go if you're in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luv2travel_RS
40,Commercial but only one end to Route 66,"Always fun to take a walk there, see people fishing. The Lobster Grille at the beginning is worth the stop and the burgers on the Pier if you are hungry and cannot wait until 3rd street :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hilaire2009
40,Great atteactiom,Went to the pier as tourists with my partner and I thought it was a great attraction. Lots to see and do and it is like walking into the set of GTA. Had a great time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/423hughj
50,Enough to do on and around the pier!,"The pier is surrounded by and filled with attractions, restaurant, ocean, beach and a lot of people.

40,Lots of fun and history,"Can't come to Santa Monica without visiting the pier - such an iconic feature of Santa Monica - lots of merry-go-rounds for the young but in reality the pier is fun for all ages.Has been a feature of the area for close on 100 years with wonderful views, particularly the sunsets and Malibu in the distance and lots of cafes for lunch and stores for souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonWamberal
50,Great beach!,"So pretty and peaceful. Granted it was windy and too cool to play in the water, but feeling the sand underneath my feet and enjoying the waves was great. Can't wait to visit again when it is warmer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catheyt
40,Fun!,"It is a really long pier, with a small amusement park near the front and a restaurant at the end of the pier. Roller coaster was short but fun, with great views of the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/909Mary
40,Pretty Cool,"What an amazing place, full of history and culture, but also just such great scenery. Make sure you get to the pier at sunset as people local and visitors alike flood the pier for the best view, and while you are there check out some street artists and good food along the way",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/518priscillaw
50,the only place,"if you are in Santa Monica, and you do not know what to do, go to the pier. this place is amazing. Beautiful view and a little park in the middle. There are a lot of artists playing and singing and some restaurants. The best way to finish a day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_Q9796UE
50,Great Place To Visit,"Next to a wonderful Santa Monica Beach, where you can park. A short, fun walk to the end of the pier. Many food choices. A few rides. A good family destination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelinAlan
40,Santa Monica sights and sounds,Touristy. Good if you like crowds. Great food on the pier. You can feel the vibe even as you make your way down to the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RahulGeorge
50,Just came here for the fun,"Enjoyable!Best place for seafood and people watch. Kids will have a blast here. Just watch your step, you might trip on the wooden boardwalk because it's kinda uneven.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReviewGuyNoVI
40,Nice,It is a really nice place to take a walk. The views of the sunset are amazing. You can also go down to the beach. There are a lot of people but it's worth to visit from time to time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ewam379
50,End of the road,"Well after a month long road trip and over 7000 miles to make it to the Santa Monica Pier was exciting. We arrived in time to see the sun set. The next morning we arrived and parked on the pier, we returned to the pier after a day out on bus tour and had dinner at Bubba Gumps. Another must do in my list, so tick !! Strolled along and enjoyed the street performers. So much talent. There are numerous souvenir shops and stalls, choice of eateries and of course, no trip would be complete without a ride on the Santa Monica Ferris wheel and a pic by the Route 66 end of the trail sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynnola
50,Worth the visit,"Santa Monica was lovely. From Hollywood cost about €40 dollars to cab it bu worth it. If cabing around, uber cabs is a great & safe option. We saved a lot of money, just upload the app on your phone..The pier was lovely, rides, attractions but just pleasant to walk around. We walked up into town and was very clean & quaint!! We'd stay there if we returned rather than in Hollywood itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RUSTYBUCKET81
50,A must see,"This was the ultimate attraction - we enjoyed seeing where Route 66 ends. Lots of attractions and activities for families. People of all cultures, buskers who were very talented. Lots of food places and of course Bubba Gumps.An attraction at the end of the pier was a seal swimming and people fishing off the end of the pier. The wind was a little cool but sunny but that didn't stop many going for a dip but the beach was quite steep - caution needed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blondy36
40,Great old school pier,"The pier has a wonderful old school feel to it, straight out of a film. Go and visit in the early evening as the sun sets as it's beautiful and still buzzing with people",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sarsywarsy
40,Cool pier,Noce pier with a lot of shops and restaurants. If the weather is good you ll have a nice view on the sea. Its a very famous place although piers are quute common in california. If you're close to it you'll check it out anyway so you dont really need my advice.Cool historical fact: this is where the route 66 officially ends.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Oliver-going-places
40,Worthwhile a visit!,"Great to see the pier, definitely worth checking out, quite a bit to do on the pier, arcade machines and a few rides you can go on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gnwgeorge84
50,Santa Monica Pier,It took us almost 3 hours driving to get to the pier from San Diego. We got there at 10:30am however the rides were not running at that time. There are public rest rooms on the pier. The souvenirs are cheaper on the pier then in the stores. Plenty of food & coffee to buy on the pier as well. You can walk to the dept. stores & there is a park nearby. If you go during the week you might be able to find street parking or cheaper parking in some hotel garages. For our convenience we paid $12 at the lot at the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/160dawnz
30,Touristy,"The surrounding beachfront and parks makes for a nice stroll here, but once there I find it too crowded for my taste, plus it has kind of a dirty feel. Makes for interesting people watching, but overall it's just too touristy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AtlantaLadybugBarb
30,Worth a visit-- once.,"This icon is really a rather sleazy tourist trap, but it is worth strolling down once to gawk at the other gawkers and all the hawkers. What you see is about what you should expect.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johncgore

40,Great atmosphere to walk up and down,lovely views - some good restaurants.Nice summers day walk and day outCan eat at Bubba shrimp or the Lobster,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TryingNewStuff
50,No to miss,It was the end of a Coast to coast trip. It is a must see. Quite pleasant area with many activities. Slightly overpriced services but worth the penny.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Slowdent
40,Visit the Pier,Well worth viewing the famous pier. We walked from Venice Beach all the way up to Santa Monica Pier with a few stops along the way.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/781waynem
50,Amazing time,One of the places i loved the most. People watching and staring at the sun while having coffee. Very serene nice place to eat lunch or dinner walk in the sand,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vlad0930
40,Santa Monica,End of famous Route 66 is here. Used in many movies and tv series. Nice beach area and great pier with small amusement park. Has restaurants on it. Very nice place to visit. Parking is very close. If arrive from Santa Monica do not exit on the ramp but keep right to go to the close by parking lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T11N
30,Nice for a stroll,"Coming from the UK the pier is pretty much like a lot of piers back home. They have the usual arcades, stalls and rides. If you have children then you could spend a few hours on the pier, but be prepared to spend a lot of money too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amanda1051
40,Looking good!,"Found parking in the public garage a couple blocks from the beach. It has 90 minutes free parking. However, this is not much time to casually enjoy the pier, beach, or city shops. It is a really nice place to visit and shop. Wish we had more time to spend here. Rent a bike or stroll along the paved beach pathway. Will definitely return to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RussHonolulu
40,Famous Location,"Two adults went for a stroll on Sunday morning when it was not crowded. Clean, attractive pier with shops, restaurants and a small amusement park (opens later in the day). Great views of the beach and ocean scenery! Was fun to watch the fishermen on the end of the pier. Public restrooms are available. It's free to go on the pier but of course you have to buy tickets for the games and rides. There are pay parking lots at the base of the pier. You can also access the beach trail from here and walk up and down the beach. The pier is wheelchair accessible but it is a boardwalk so the surface is somewhat bumpy/uneven - take it slow.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrankingChick
30,Sad collection of rides,"We were disappointed by the Fun fair on the Pier - It looks enticing from afar - lots of colour, dominated by a Ferris Wheel, but up close, it all looks a bit dated and sad (and overpriced!), and badly needs updating. Even their lovely Carousel has been housed in a poorly-lit hanger, draining all the colour from what could be a delightful sight. Underwhelmed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mike_Kwasniak
30,Like Blackpool UK with more tramps,"Underwhelmed! I need to fill 100 words, maybe I should just write, tramps 100 times, the place was full of them. If you have kids, it's a good place to take them, it's way overpriced for food and drinks and the view isn't the best. But as a piece of nostalgia it okay. Did I mention there's tramps? That's 100!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Superally2007
50,"Sun, Seafood, Sights and Sounds of Santa Monica","Lots to see at Santa Monica Pier. Started the day at the restaurant at the far end of the pier. Had authentic Mexican/seafood and ice cold drinks overlooking the ocean. We arrived about a half hour after the place opened and experienced pretty no wait and prime patio seating.The pier has an abundance of performers, fruit vendors, gift shops and food. The restrooms were clean and equipped with showers to rinse off from the beach.Families can also enjoy carnival games and rides right on the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessidrpepper
30,Normal,If you want to have fun with kids its ok bit if you want fun go to the beach but its cold. Just for take picsNormal si vas con niños hay juegos mecanicos y playa pero helada.No es gran cosa. Mejor venice beach si eres joven o adulto soltero,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/guest20122012
40,Great View,"It's a nice walk out to the end of the old wooden pier where there are small stalls along the way with a kiddy carnival at the end with rides & sideshow alley, there is a fishing area at the end of the pier, you can sit on the large viewing area & watch the passing parade & the waves roll in. We went on the roller coaster which was very tame & expensive ($8US), this pier is theoretically the end of Route 66 so there is a shop selling Route 66 souvenirs. There is a great Mexican restaurant at the end of the pier that I would recommend ""Mariasol"". It was a beautiful sunny afternoon but it did get windy as the sun went down, great spot for photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/73Chelle73
40,Nice Pier..........,Nice Pier and nice to walk down it. It is not huge like the S.F. Pier 39. Had some good restaurants and shops along the way. Worth checking out if in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler06232009
30,Great views of the Pacific.,"My favorite part of the Santa Monica Pier is the far end where you can watch a few brave souls cast lines to fish. The ocean was magnificent the day I was there, and there was one clever sea lion hanging out near the fishing lines hoping to catch fish before the fishermen did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sfgranny
50,beautiful experience,"I was there on a cold and blustery day in early April so, with the winds blowing off the ocean, it was very cold. It was beautiful! the ocean was as spectacular as I have ever seen it! I also enjoyed the shops and amusement park although it was cold.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/irisa208
40,Always a Good Time!,"This is always a great time. How can it not be.... It's way to cool?!?! We always enjoy having an ice cream come from one of the shops on the Pier & sitting on a bench overlooking the ocean, very, very cool!! The Pier is always full of activity and lots of action..... Especially Friday & Saturday nights. All kinds of performers & musicians are out showing off their talents. It's also a great place for pictures with the water in the back ground. If you haven't been to Santa Monica Pier, and your in the area...,, check it out..... It's a neat place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnK564

50,What a fun place!,"This was a very pleasant surprise. I thought it may have cost to get in, but its free :)I went here on a whim, and am so glad i did. The pier was uncrowded, a lot to see (street performers, great little shops and a wonderful view of the ocean as well as Santa Monica) and a lot of fun. I bought one of the ""finger painted"" souvenir mirror pictures for $10, which was a great remembrance.There is a small amusement park here, which was fun, and very clean. The roller coaster is great, especially with the ocean below.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TerryElvers
40,family fun in the california sun,"really nice place to stroll, listen to the buskers, watch the surfers or the sunset, the shops are a little tacky, but what would you expect - its the seaside",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thestonefamily
40,Glad we visited.,This is the place you see in movies and I am glad that we took the time to visit even for a short time. We rode the roller coaster which was a short ride but they gave us another go for free as there was no one waiting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuliSydney_Australia

50,Classic amusement park fun on the beach,"I went to the pier with my 11 year old daughter. We had an absolute blast riding some classic amusement park rides, eating ice cream, and enjoying the view. We bought the unlimited ride ticket and went on pretty much all the rides. It was so much fun riding the roller coaster right near the ocean. The pier itself was also a lot of fun. People playing music and lots of souvenir stands.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K_T_8889

It also has great restaurants with an outstanding view of the Pacific Ocean. You can also enjoy the sand and waves.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CynthiaC205
50,Great day/night out spot!,"This place never gets old for me. It is always a lot of fun whether you are coming with your family, friends or a date. It is fun for all ages. Weekends gets crowded so be ready to see skaters and crowds. But, it is always a good time. Live music in the pier always entertaining with a variety of crazies which makes it funny or some good experienced singers and acts. Overall, a great plan on a day out or even at night. Don't forget to live the fair experience riding the rides and playing for prizes!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/813darlenev

50,The Pier,"Wonderful place to visit. It was our last stop on our Route 66 trip and we really enjoyed it.

40,Iconic,"I have mixed emotions of the Pier. I think it is great to see one time, but not necessarily something I would go to, every time I visit. It is iconic, has shops that you would expect on a boardwalk, and restaurants. Not too crazy about the food at the end of the pier. You get a great view, but you can have it without eating in one of the restaurants. There are some good restaurants under the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/7books
50,Very clean and the view is just breathtaking,"We visited really early on a Saturday.Parking was easy. There is pretty much parking EVERYWHERE and it is $3.00 per hour.Very accessible.When we went, there wasn't as much people and shops were still close.Although there was an event that day, we didn't find it very crowded at all.We walked around the pier and it was windy, but weather was still amazing.There are bathrooms in the mid-section of the pier, it is very clean and well maintained.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/800abigaili
50,Cool,"We stayed right up Pico and had to walk down to the pier! It was beautiful! Lit up, and just amazing to see the ocean around it. Ride fares were steep.

50,Pier was full of activity,Went to the Pier early in the morning when it was not busy. Very clean but everything very expensive. A lot of history there and people friendly. Only downside all the homeless people begging outside the pier. It is free to walk the pier but the ferris wheel and merry go round along with food are expensive,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellymN5692VU
50,A Classic Attraction for the whole family,"Almost magical as you walk down the long ramp from the street onto the wooden floorboards. Fishermen, Pelicans, shops, rides, restaurants, and souvenir shops make it the complete afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H7738TCbillh
40,You have to do it,"When in Santa Monica you have to have a stroll along the pier. Nothing better on a hot day. Yes it's a bit tacky, but the lovely sea breeze, big wheel, musicians, and seals make it worthwhile. You can also get a great photo of Santa Monica and the beach. A pier with blue skies and warm sunshine, it's what all Brits dream of.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RedFoxRuby
40,Very crowded,I just walked to the end for the beautiful views. Great if you have kids for the rides. I was there on Sunday afternoon and there were only a handful of performers.There's a few tourist shops for trinkets. You gotta get a picture under Route 66 end of the line.The beach was even more interesting with all the acrobatics and community yoga.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roadtrip911

50,Don't miss the ferris wheel!,"We love the pier! Fun to see some interesting people like the man who will tell you a joke for a buck or Zoltar machine that tells you your fortune. Go on the Ferris wheel! Such a treat to see the ocean and beach from that vantage point! And if you get lucky, at the end of the beach a sea lion might be swimming nearby the fishermen hoping for a free meal!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deborat51957
10,"All hype, nothing to see or do.","This place is a real tourist trap. Parking is $20.00 if you don't want to walk eight blocks. Not a decent restaurant or store on the pier. Lots of people walking around but not really anything to see. Too many street vendors selling junk like magnets, tee-shirts, and post cards. If you miss this ""attraction"" you won't have missed anything. However, if you are into foreign tourists taking selfies, this is the place to be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nat1950
40,Very good Pier,"Probably one of the nicer piers I've been on and I've seen a bunch. Stuff for people of all ages and doesn't feel as fake as some I've been on before.

Great views of the mountains and ocean from there and plenty of nearby parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Banny9949

40,Work,The hotel where We stayed was walking distance to the pier so spend a couple of hours playing some of their carnival games.Just something to do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paularusia
50,Know What You Are Looking For,"This is basically a giant tourist trap amusement pier, but it offers great people watching, great views, and an interesting perspective on LA. While it is packed with tourists, it's also got a steady flow of locals who use it for hanging out. If that sounds good to you, then by all means plan a visit. While there are pretty bla restaurants out on the Pier, there are lots of really great choices within a short walk. Nice place to watch the sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonWasnt
40,classic place,nice place to hangout with the kids. beautiful views and fun rides. 16 dollars a bracelet for each kid. well worth the price.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rz1519
30,Ok,"Not the most amazing place but worth a look, pier is looking a bit run down. A variety of characters around. LA traffic was a nightmare coming from Hollywood!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kattraveller99
30,Go early to avoid the crowds,"The pier is a must and I'm sure it is fun for the kids, but it's crowded and has they same, typical stuff. We kind of just went to say we had been there. Still, the views of the ocean are very pretty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennifercQ5506AV
50,Great Place to Visit,"There is plenty to do on Santa Monica Pier. There is a the Pacific Park amusement rides, fishing platforms, restaurants, musicians, the excellent view of the beach, and of course, the opportunity to take a photo under the end of Route 66 sign. I suppose you could say, ""You get your kicks on Route 66 if you are on the pier.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DenPearl510
50,66 to Cali,"So what do you do when your Hotel's 2 minutes walk from Santa Monica Pier. It's a must see and do, but this visit was made much more interesting because we met Ian, who was running the 66 to Cali kiosk at the end of Route 66. He is a mind of information, with fabulous historical anecdotes of the prohibition era and local history. His knowledge of Route 66 must be second to none, but he also appeared very knowledgeable regarding our Highway 1 tour. Whilst the Pier is an obvious tourist trap, it would appear to be a popular destination for locals on a Sunday night and the whole place was buzzing. Thanks to Ian for recommending Ristorante al Mare at the beginning of the pier, and for wetting our appetite for further American tours in the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/the_pros_from_dover
30,Meh,"The views are beautiful, there's no doubt about that, but I guess my expectations were a little too high on the amount of things to do. There's a few shops, a few places to eat, and expensive carnival rides. But the beach access is awesome and the views are too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrsblp
50,Great for the whole family,"This was our first stop in LA. We all had our reasons for visiting here. It was in my favorite movie, it had rides for the kids and we had our first taste of American food here. It was a good to visit here after flying for 14 hours. We got sun on faces and and head plenty to keep us awake. It was nice to walk in the sand and water even though it was a bit cold in May to swim. The hop on hop off bus goes here and was good to see other parts of LA using this service rather than driving which looked very scary to us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/961amandaw
50,Pretty place,"Going to the pier is better if you do it at night, there's more action. Sometimes even bands playing for free, like a concert. I once went when Santa Cecilia was playing. Eating or doing stuff there is kinda pricy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lily_och
30,Lots to see and do,"Took a wonder down to the pier when I first arrived in Santa Monica.If you have time then I would take a walk down but I wouldn't miss out on something else if you're short of time.There are carnival type rides and a lot of souvenir kiosks and street entertainers.Great for a walk to take in the feel of the area.Also great beaches either side, a short walk from bars and restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chops2409
30,"More Sizzle, No Steak",I was excited to come here but the excitement wore off quickly. There just wasnt much to do here.I expected more shops and some different items. Just the same ole stuff as any other beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/795charliea
20,Waste of time,"Quite disappointed with the Santa Monica pier, very very few rides and they are for small children. One vendor we talked to wasn't very friendly. If you skip this ""attraction"" you aren't missing out on anything",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jewelz1976
30,Overrated,In my personal opinion this pier is kinda overrated. Its just some simple attractions/rides and some artists selling/making stuff and a Mexican restaurant. Fun to see for one time but other than that nothing special.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/450clairev
30,Late Night,"There was nothing going on, so just our bad timing. Lots of young-high schooled aged-people on dates which made for people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hebardC
40,Very Enjoyable,I was very pleased we took the time to visit the Pier. The pictures from advertising sites do not do it justice. There are many things to see with Street Performers Entertaining and great food options! Bike rental is also located at the Pier. One recommendation is to be aware of a long incline in the walking which takes you to and from the Pier. If you have a need for assistance and/or unable to walk a fair distance both uphill and downhill I would suggest contacting the tourist information centre for accommodations. A must explore when in Santa Monica!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/victoriamA5871PD
50,Neat to see,"Wanted to see this place since it's been in so many movies. Route 66 ends here, muscle beach is cool and didn't know that Hot Dog on a Stick started here too. Kinda a cool place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JodieC25
40,Touristy but you gotta do it,Do it if only to say you've done it. Get some great photos of the beach and the pier and maybe some form of greasy sideshow alley food if you have to. Sit and enjoy the water and a local performer but mainly its the photo ops.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emkaloma
50,Fun!,"The pier was definitely fun. We walked down it and got to see people performing, just like if you are on the pier in San Francisco. There were little restaurants and coffee shops all along. I was a little disappointed that the ferris wheel was like $15 per person to ride. I really wanted to, but it definitely wasnt THAT worth it haha. So we continued to walk.We went down to the beach, the sand was HOT. The water was COLD. hahahIt was a nice time! Anyone looking to relax, walk and kill some time definitely go.I would totally go again if in LA, this time more prepared though because this time we didnt have much time to spend so we didnt bring towels or anything.I recommend parking a little bit away from the pier and walking. The traffic is crazy busy down at the pier. crazy busy. plus there was construction haha so it was insane.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alishaaloraee32
50,Great California Icon,What a blast this place is. Lots of great excitement and energy. Great people watching under the famous Ferris wheel overlooking the California coastline . We drove there and parked in the lot for a nominal fee and took the kids on rides and ate dinner there. I never knew that the Santa Monica beach is right next to Venice Beach. And driving along the beach after Santa Monica is Malibu. The whole area is so accessible and easy to navigate. Malibu beaches had surfing contests going on which were fun to watch. Also fun to swim by the Lifeguard huts from Baywatch on Santa Monica Beach !!! Once is not enough !!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolBradyGonzalez
30,Saw It...,Well now I can say I seen it. It was neat to see but don't think I'd go back. It was busy with people and local vendors selling trinkets. Was there at dusk to see the lights coming on so that was pretty. Lots of little places to eat mixed in with the shops also. Good photo opportunities.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StaceyM795
40,Don't miss Santa Monica Pier,"Santa Monica Pier is a great place to visit and also great for kids.There are many shops for tourists, restaurants and beach. There is a fun park for kids and lots of fast food.Also for those who don't know, it is the end of Route 66.Parking prices are reasonable.It's a fun day out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/664jenniferu
50,"Beautiful place,don't miss it!",The Pier is the end of route 66. Beautiful to see at sunset. The Pacific Park is in the same place so it's a great fun place for everyone to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/equisi
40,Cheesy and Tacky Fun,"We started at Venice Beach enjoying the weird and wonderful. The skate park is a great place to watch shredders shredding - who knew you could do a flip on a razorboard? Walked the boardwalk from VB to Santa Monica Pier. Past wide beautiful beach, vendors and t-shirt shops - and ""medicinal"" marijuana clinics. Nice walk - 30-45 minutes. The pier is what you'd want in a pier. Food, trinket&bead shops, t-shirts, rollercoasters, Ferris wheel. The ubiquitous Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. at every tourist trap. There's an aquarium beneath the pier. The pier's a fitting endpoint (or beginning) of Route 66 - cheesy, low-brow Americana. Why not - grab a corn dog and some cotton candy. Watch the fishermen feed fish guts to the waiting sea lion. Thrill to the street magician. Get your name painted in characters or on a grain of rice. Watch ocean swells hit the pier supports in succession while a guy plays Hawaiian music on a guitar. It's all good old-fashioned American fun - and after the wonderful weirdness of Venice Beach, you'll need a reset to semi-normal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aloft1961
50,Such a great place to visit,"We loved Santa Monica Pier, a great atmosphere, the people are love and the view is absolutely gorgeous. Plenty to do or simply sit and enjoy the view. Some nice places to eat and plenty of buskers to keep you amused or awed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leebell82
40,Touristy but cool,"Stopped by here briefly. Very busy and very touristy, but still a cool place to visit and pretty beautiful at sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X375IEelizabethg
50,Great view from above the pier (neat downtown Santa Monica),This was just beautiful and the weather was perfect. I took great pics with my phone. I'm so glad that I stumbled upon the amazing view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/693erint
20,Looks better at night.,"Very old and maybe historic, but sure could use some newer attractions. many areas are undergoing repairs, but look to be more of maintenance function.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gordonclra
50,Must Visit!,You can really get a good LA feeling. You really have a lot to see here. From stores to amusent park. But the best is just to take a long walk and feel the vibes.Also you can not miss the end the end of the mythic route 66.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PedTrigo
30,Too Crowded,"You can barely take a nice picture or appreciate the sunset. Is not the best place to buy your souvenirs (if you're going to the walk of fame you should by there).There's fun specially for kids, my friend and I had fun there because is nice just to be there, take pictures, see the pier, walk and browse around, but is too crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melissasN9025LT
20,Another tourist trap.,"Altough the beach area is nice, the pier itself is a small tivoli with some mediocre but too expensive restaurants. Parking is really expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FABJourney
50,Lots to see,"We had perfect weather as we strolled the Pier. There are shops, musicians, food, fishing, great views, and activities. Great people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/976stevek
50,A must to visit,"My first time here and it didn't disappoint. I love the atmosphere here. Good vibes. Smiling faces everywhere . Though I didn't try out the restaurants or stop by the shops, I thought of visiting it again when I have more time. But when one is here in LA, it's a must in one's itinerary . That's if you love the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tejtej18
40,Enjoyable place.,It's worth seeing specially for children. Adults also find charm in it. We all were amused. A plane carrying a big banner was flying. Below is a big beach . One can enjoy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mohammadi2014
30,Windy day at the beach,"We visited Santa Monica on a Saturday, so expected it to be busy, which it was. We didn't expect it to be as windy though, so our day of lying on the beach to catch the rays didn't go to plan.If I'm honest, I wasn't bowled over by the pier. I thought it looked great on Grand Theft Auto 5, but in reality it was very cluttered, busy (in terms of things, not just people) and wasn't as relaxed as I was hoping.I thought it was a bit of a tacky seaside resort kind of place, which I wasn't expecting. It was almost like Hollywood boulevard on a pier, with people trying to sell things and lots of food and gift places crammed together. I expected it to be quite upmarket, since the hotels in the area are so expensive and the houses even more so, but the pier itself just wasn't.Maybe it's just not my kind of pier, like Huntington Beach pier is.It's probably worth a trip if you're staying in the LA area and want a beach day, but unless you have small children or you're happy just sitting in a bar all day then I wouldn't bother planning a full day here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AC1712
30,Quintessential Los Angeles,"I know people tell you this is a ""must see"", but I can't say Santa Monica Pier was worth more that a quick stop. There are prettier beach areas as you head up the coast, and none of the gimmicky tourist stalls. Next time I will just drive by and wave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sabrinayb
50,Route 66,"Very nice place, lots of shops, restaurant and bar around the pier.Perfect holiday trip with children. Car park 12$/day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vargaagi76
30,Boring pier but great city,The activity on the pier is boring but the beach and City of Santa Monica are great with lots of things to see and excellent restaurants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M6464OLgeorges
40,Nice pier but horribly crowded,"There is parking on the pier but it fills quickly. a few places to near but they tend towards average. There are amusement rides, places to fish and benches to sit down. Worth a visit if you can park and endure the throngs of tourists",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pandpCalifornia
40,Things have changed.....,"We visited the Pier 8 years ago with a group of teens and we're excited to take another large group (44) to enjoy the same experience. Large groups are dropped off at the visitors center and are expected to walk to the pier. We took the same path and there was a noticeable increase in the number of homeless. There were only two, to my knowledge, that approached the group and no hostile behavior. It was, however, a wake up call to we Midwestern travelers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MME4ME
20,Worth 30 minutes but not more,"Very disappointing. It's not big, you can walk out and back in 20 minutes. Only a few shops, a few rides and places to eat. Skip the Bubba Gump, etc and enjoy the view instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timbG5619YY
30,Overrated,You see this place on the movies and then you go there and it's really not anything that amazing. Interesting but average. Wouldn't bring the family back to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/desinerg
40,Perfect for long walks,"It was a nice day for visiting the Santa Monica Pier. After driving around Beverly Hills we decided to go to Santa Monica. We got to the pier around 11:00 a.m. on a Friday morning so there weren't a lot of people there.There seems to be a lot to do at the pier but we went mainly to visit the beach and to have a nice, long walk on a beautiful, sunny day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelenNoel23
40,Fun Pier,"It is fun to explore the pier, there is a fun fair and restaurants along it. It is also nice to take photos from.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HolidayCaz
40,Fun at the beach!,"This pier has activities for children and rides for adults. You can walk to the beach and the entrance to the actual pier is free. You must pay to get on the rides. Parking Tip: the majority of the places around offer a $20 parking, but there is a Public Parking across the Wyndham that offers first 90 minutes free of charge, this is a great option if you want to walk the pier, take pictures and be back :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ADR_8
40,Fun to visit - especially at night when it's all lit up,"When you mix a mini carnival with the ocean you get the Santa Monica Pier. It's just a fun place to hang out. Whether you go there to ride the ferris wheel or the mini roller coaster or to just walk to the end of the pier and stare out in to the ocean, it's just a fun place that should be checked out. Yes, there will be tons of people (great if you're in to people watching) and tons of vendors selling stuff but that's the fun of it. We visited at night so we could see it all lit up. It was a great setting. Lots of fun things to see and do while enjoying the sound of the waves crashing around the pier. At the end of the pier, we saw a sea lion swimming around where people were fishing so that was a nice bonus. Grab a funnel cake, ride the ferris wheel and just take it all in. It's certainly worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ssy24
40,lovely traditional pier,"Great place to take the family.Check out the interesting history of the pier.Plenty to do, recommend trying Bubba Gump shrimp co.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnc934
50,"""Shoes off"" and ""Toes in sand""","Out of all the attractions that we went to in Los Angelos, this was by far my favorite. I couldnt stop looking at the waves, and the rippling of the water against the pier. I absolutely adore the beach and this was one of my favorite places of all time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/788pattyf
40,Lights are beautiful at night,"We got there about 7:30, so most everything was shut down, but it was still fun to walk and watch the lights on the Ferris wheel and listen to the ocean. Even though most everything was closing, there were still many people coming and going.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jessi_STL
50,Will Be Back!,"Lovely area, very interesting. Great place to people watch. Hard to find parking but we managed to find a spot on the street. So much to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lilcountrypeach
40,great place to visit swimming good nice waves to surf or body surf,"The pier is great plenty going on kids loved the roller coaster $8 each per ride ...good swimming beach.., the water temp in April was chilly but couldnt resist ...good powerful waves to surf or body surf...can be a subject too a sideways rip I was told by a lifeguard there but the day I went there was none...sandy bottom gradual drop off...lifeguards on duty during the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaredh661
50,This has been my lifelong dream!,I had a favorite show growing up called Rocket Power. It's based off of this pier so when I finally went I lost it. I was taking so many pictures and swimming with my friends/cousins. I vowed to go back sometime and I definitely will someday. The best pier and beach for me!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunnyTravels1
40,Very long pier marks the end of Route 66,"Traveled the pier at night and had food at Bubba Gumps the light were on and the atmosphere was grate. Be warned tho at night it does get chilly as the wind whips up over the sea, so if your planning on spending the day and some of the evening take something warmer to wear :) will i return again 100% yes. loads of little shops and things to do...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lee_jamie_hill
40,A must see if visiting Los Angeles,A good day out for children of all ages beach very nearby once they have had enough of the rides and stalls on the pier. Great atmosphere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndySmith1967
50,Great Pier with lots to see! Bring the kids!,"We've been to a few of the other piers near here,and this one was the best. Although the rides and food on the pier are pricey, it is fun to walk around to see the sights. Definitely a great pier to take the kids to!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angieh460
50,Great place to walk and take pictures,"The pier itself is always crowded, however, there are some great rides and market stalls. The pier is the perfect place for an afternoon walk or a great place to take photos of the ocean, Santa Monica beach or the coastline. It is definitely a must visit. Make sure to leave enough time, which was our mistake as there are also great stores on the blocks parallel to the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sam_Cassaniti
50,Great,"If you are hanging out in the area- definitely stop. The rides and attractions are fun, go at any age",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Innerperspective
50,this place is really cool - old rides and amusements,"We enjoyed the experience. Lots of good picture opps. It has an old roller coaster and some old rides. Of course, the ferris wheel is cool and has some great views of the ocean and beach areas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/98bradleyt
50,Great Place to Visit,Stroll the pier for some fresh air. There are places to buy food. When the Metro Line to Santa Monica is complete I will definitely take that to save on the hassles of driving and finding parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeLinCPA
50,Beautiful pier and beach,"Santa Monica became one of the go to places for me any time I visit LA.I saw a lot of beautiful pictures online and always wanted to see it and after I did I fell in love.It has beautiful pier and there you can see all those musicians playing. Some of them are really great. If you get very lucky you can hear Daniel Morris playing his violin.My advice if you somewhere near Santa Monica, stop at the pier and take a walk along ocean. It's very peaceful there relaxing",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Svetlanka-huliganka
40,A nice afternoon out,"The pier was nice to have a walk down, it's still well looked after and there was plenty of parking right at the entrance you can even park your RV on there but it was quite expensive.There are little souvenir shops and stalls with things to buy and the odd Street performer.There are three large restaurants one at the top is the Albright then bubba gump shrimp and a Mexican at the bottom. There is also a small food court area that sells tacos, pizza and ice cream and a few other things.You can also go fishing off the bottom of the pier.It's worth a visit if you are in the area and is a fun day out for everyone when doing Pacific park at the same time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glenc360
40,Touristy but worth walking around,"I just needed to walk around the pier and check the box. It was worth it. Nothing too exciting on the pier - an amusement park, bad fair type food and touristy shops. There is a restaurant at the end of the pier where a lot of locals fish. A neat thing I saw while there was a sea lion (or seal?). It was just 1 and very unexpected - a nice surprise. I believe you can ride the ferris wheel for $8 per person as well as some of the other rides. There wasn't anything nice about any of the rides - typical fair rides and games. The aquarium is right there on the pier as well but I didn't go. It is worth stopping by, walking around and taking in the views of the beach/city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ctaylor0159
30,Great place to wander and people watch,We spent a lovely afternoon wandering on the pier and people watching. Our 3 year old was fascinated but all the hustle and bustle. We had food in the sunshine and enjoyed cotton candy too before playing on the beach.We didn't go on any of the rides but our son enjoyed the atmosphere and watching them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonnieHall82
40,Gorgeous photo spot all year round,"I took my 8 year old twins here & there's something special about old fashioned theme park rides on a pier over the water. The rides are fairly ordinary, in the sense that you've seen them all before. But the beach view is gorgeous as are any of the hot bodies that rollerblade, cycle & jog the foreshore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Renaesworldofficial
50,Santa Monica Pier,So much fun...walking down the pier and looking across the Pacific Ocean was amazing! Seeing local entertainment from all walks of life performing was fun. We thoroughly enjoyed it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnrC9996QF
30,Very touristy,It's fun to go and see the pier but I found it to be very touristy all the shops are selling souvenirs or food. Which is to be expected but there is not really much else to see there. The Route 66 sign and some of the information boards were interesting so I recommend you go to the pier but don't expect to hang around all day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/674588
50,Great relaxing,"Loved it, very fun, great walk, great entertainment, easy to find parking no problem, enjoyed hanging 0ut",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/937beckyl
50,Bus trip to Santa Monica,We caught the Rapid Express Big Blue Bus which only cost $1.50 for all day travel for each of us as seniors. It was great to see the Santa Monica Pier and Third Street Promenade. It was well worth the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/362laraines
50,"Beautiful, Clean, Reasonably Priced Family Fun","Great place for a family to do while in Santa Monica. Burger and fries, merry-go-round, fishing, rides, arcade, and parking. its pretty much a must do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RogersVA
50,"Beautiful in the day, Even better @ Night!","Great place to visit when going down to the beach. I say park near there. Walk the pier. Eat at Bubba Gumps. So much to do.From there head to Venice, than Mussel!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicolehA5686RN
30,Fun place to visit,"Ok so it's Santa Monica pier - famous, iconic. It is hugely American with a carnival atmosphere. Nice to wander around for half an hour. Quite small and not that much of interest- not as buzzy and interesting as Pier 39 in San Francisco. Great Bubba Gumps if you like that ( we do) and good for people watching. Oh and if you happen to finish Route 66 in Santa Monica his is where the official Finish is posted in a neat kiosk selling t shirts and completion certificates.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/160trishw
30,Grand theft Auto,"Grand Theft Auto had it accurate! Lol It looks exactly like the San Andreas video game.Lots of available & affordable parking. Very clean, safe for kids & families. If you are into fitness this beach is for you. If you are not there a other things to do.The Pier isn't too long, I didn't go on any of the rides, but the view is beautiful.The bathrooms are plenty- no long lines and you can rent bikes and roller blades for an affordable price for the whole day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinarodriguez29
30,Take a stroll but don't get sucked into this tourist trap,"It's obviously a tourist trap. It's not bad for a stroll on a nice day. The street performers can be a bit obnoxious. Kids will enjoy all of the sights and sounds, but mine were ready to go after about 30 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmedrano2013
30,Very touristic,Nice to see but nothing special for our bucket list. Parkingplace was full but for once nice to see when you have kids. And the beach is perfect with white sand,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marettab
50,Great short visit and reasonable place to eat,Was able to meet with my wonderful daughter a Marine. There is a reasonable parking near the pier. And it's a great little walk. You could walk to Venice Beach but that's a long long walk. Enjoy the beach and some of the restaurants. I would stay away from Bubba Gump.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristinaN239
30,If you like street life with characters and tourists,"A mini amusement park, lots of typical tourist stuff,food stands for the acute hungry.But that entertains most is to behold the crowds and a sea lion swimming far out on the pier",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phayao13
40,Nice pier,"The pier is crowdy, but nice and friendly. You van see a lot of different shops, street performers and of course the fun park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/939carlineh
40,Must see if you hate the hot weather of LA at the summertime.,"Our friends told that the lightening of the Pier made by led beams, using solar elecrictiy panels.And it is true. At he States, only in California you find environmental friendly solutions (eg.: our rental Tesla eas parking free, upon registration). So nice try, we loved it. Avoid Bubba Gump - try Pier Burger!If you are sporty - try the attractions of the trapeze school. Likes guaranteed after selfies there!Tip: the best shops are just 5min walk from the Pier at the 3rd street promenade. Much better value for your your money there..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Itdoesentmatter
30,For First timers,If this is your first visit to Santa Monica the pier is must do experience - locals go for special events. The carousel is a classic; amusement rides are pricey; Rusty's serves a fair meal.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoYork
40,Fun Tourist Spot!,The Santa Monica Pier is a fun stop. There are several restaurants on the pier to choose from. The view of the beach with the mountains in the background is really amazing. Great place to walk around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karinabay22
30,Good for a five minute visit,"I took the Blue bus from downtown LA- really wanted to go to Venice beach but the bus went to Santa Monica, a block from the pier. I thought I might eat there, but the prices were tourist gouging level. Its a sweet place though, and if I had kids, would have enjoyed it more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CSSnowshoer
20,You can skip it,"I was not impressed by this pier. I've been to many that were far better. All the hype about the Santa Monica Pier is not what it cracks up to be. More for kids to ride the rides. The ""carnival food"" isn't even great. I would skip it and take a road trip to the Santa Cruz Pier instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MGrummer
50,Landmark Promenade,"Driving along the coast you can already see the pier sticking out into the ocean. When you get to actually walk on it, you can feel the history and the reason why it is so famous and popular. This is one one of the great piers of Southern California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElliotHiller
30,Good way to waste a couple of hours and entertain kids,"We came as we were staying in the area. I wouldn't recommend coming here if your not staying near by as it is a long way from all the other tourist destinations in LA. It was good to walk around and look at, but it is just like any other fair ground and wants to take your money except it's on a pier near the water which makes it unique I guess..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tanyaw384
40,"Very nice pier, fun for everyone and an iconic spot!","It's not a destination, but it is a very nice iconic location with a gorgeous beach and water view and fun amusements.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dobergirl2
30,Santa Monica Pier.,"Lots of fun to walk around at sunset. But don't use the public restooms under the pier. They are disgusting-- I saw things lying on the floor that I have never seen in a public ""family""bathroom. The bathrooms at the end of the pier by the amusement park were clean! There were workers in there cleaning them 24/7.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/226laurah
50,Fun Place to Visit,"The pier was an active interesting place. There were carnival type rides, including the huge farris wheel, music, lots of people fishing. We mostly enjoyed the view, the sun was setting while we were there. It was beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amazed_12
50,pretty col!,a pretty cool place to visit and a must do for LA! We enjoyed walking up the pier checking out the people and the shops and taking photos of the beaches on both sides. Was very windy so wasn't as pleasant and glad we had jumpers. Plenty of fast food or restaurants options on the actual pier itself so you can have lunch/dinner if you wish.There is a hop on hop off bus booking office there too where we booked our tour. also bike hire and toilets on their peir.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blueflag08
50,A great Time!,"We stopped for a short time at the Santa Monica Pier. The atmosphere was super friendly and laid back, and we saw a great street performance by the L.A Breakers, who were legit and very friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OchoaA03
50,Ride your bike,"Such a nice tour to do, rent a bike at Santa Monica and ride along on Santa Monica and Venice beaches. One of the real beauty of Los Angeles",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/809oliviers
50,Relaxing,"This pier was full of people, food, fun... on our last visit many dolphins swam just out of the beach, with tourists. The Santa Monica beach is one of our favorite in the US, it is always so nice!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mila_k250
40,A good place to see the sunset,"A very nice places with great winds, people performing live music, and a nice place to see the sunset.The walk takes about 15 minutes, the shops are nothing special.Provides a parking for 15$ and a quick access to Santa Monica promenade which is also nice to walk on and has a lot of places to dine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DmitryB320
30,Fun Place,"Great place to hang out and listen to the waves lapping or crashing, live music playing, festival atmosphere. Places to eat, but ask how much your paying as we ordered a lobster roll and it was $17 per sandwich. Next door at Pier Burger we got a great burger for $5. Crowded but a must visit while in Santa Monica - beautiful scenery and carnival rides too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happyladyJD
30,"Nice, clean! Not much to do on the pier.","Santa Monica pier was very nice and clean, however, there were only a few things to do on the actual pier. Restaurants, fair rides and games, shops and a small aquarium. It's great that it's close to Venice beach and the shopping district of Santa Monica. I did expect it to be larger though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/holliep0
40,Great for a stroll,"You have a lot of options once you are there: the little amusement park, shopping, eateries. Also you can see a lot of musicians and people performing magic tricks, very fun to watch.A must see if you are in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliciaMagdalena
10,Santa Monica pier was a disappointment,I was looking forward to visiting the Santa Monica pier and was so disappointed. It was dirty a lot of homeless and really not much to do. Spent about 20 minutes there and left.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/635mariannes
30,Over crowded and over priced,Ok. I get it. It is a tourist attraction. But the crowd is over the top and parking close by required a small loan.I enjoy hitting local landmarks. It is what traveling is all about. But at some point the enjoyment of it is diminished by the crowds and cost. This place is there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Devildog8411
20,Very Touristy,This is definitely a tourist spot. The pier was way too crowded as was the beach. Good for family fun or if it is your first time in LA. Otherwise skip this area and head to Venice Beach or Hermosa. Both are much cleaner and feel less like a tourist spot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/754dianeh
40,LIFE IS A BEACH,"Had time to kill, didn't fly out of LAX for seven hours, so we picked a beach near bye. We had little idea what to expect and was delighted with what we found. The jetty, pier, was a good walk and we also walked the walk way along the beach. Plenty to see and do, but this is not Disney Land, so remember it is a local beach for the locals and you guessed it the tourist, We enjoyed lunch here then walked across the road to a farmers market, a local band was playing gathering a good following, we then shopped a bit along this main road, called a taxi from one of the shops and back to the airport, a truly relaxing day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StephenC799
50,Yay!,"My husband and I ended our Route 66 trip here at the Santa Monica Pier (we started in Traverse City, Michigan!), and it was amazing! We were here both at night and late morning/early afternoon. The afternoon was fun getting to view the pier and watch the fishermen. It was my first time seeing the ocean so definitely recommend! There's all day parking near the pier and I recommend it. It was only $10 and we'll worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adams27010
30,Afternoon walk to enjoy,"A little piece of history along with honkey tonk. A good day, stuck a toe in a cold pacific ocean. Walked the pier and watched people as we all enjoyed ourselves at the official end of Highway 66.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DougG305
50,Great family destination,"This historic destination has something for everyone. Great views, fishing, amusement rides, shopping and lots of good food options. Just off the south side of the pier is muscle beach and the famous rings. Take your family and go to the beach, ride bikes along the bike path and enjoy some amazing people watching",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TerriD373
50,FUN FUN FUN,Great view over Santa Monica Bay as well as amusements galore! A fun place to dine at Bubba Gumps or relax on the beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annajeffreys
40,Good Starting point,"Maybe I am cheating in some way. I lived down in that area in the past. The Santa Monica Pier is a great starting point to check out the area and Santa Monica its self. On the pier you will have entertainers, a roller coaster (not a scary one) a restaurant. From the Pier you will see to the North Malibu and to the south Venice Pier 3 miles south and Palos Verdes further south. It is fun to people watch and check out the waves rolling in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gregh739
50,"Day and night, you will have fun, and great memories!","Lots of people said they always bring their first date here! The wheel is a fun way to start your date, the view is a delight! Fun and food for 2 to 99 years old! Souvenirs, funny photos, and games. They even have a place with very healthy food. Very clean bathrooms!!!! A treat! A gift! A memorie! A place to be!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bips14
50,Nice morning out,"First day in the USA, couldn't check in to accommodation till 1pm, so we decided to come here. Had breakfast at Bubba Gump, which was nice. It's a great place to relax and get over jet lag after a 12 hour flight from Hong Kong! (Jet lagged because we arrived 2 hours before we left)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/201haydenr
50,Fun for all ages!,The Santa Monica Pier has a yummy Mexican resturant at the end and fun rides for family! We were able to watch dolphins from the pier and enjoy the close beach as well. It's clean and has a safe feeling even when it's dark.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelGurl25
40,Beautiful,Great way to see the beach and visit the attractions and restaurants. If you have children you must spend the day there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/francasimone
30,Nothing special,Yes it's pretty but I've seen prettier beaches. Not many options for food. Mostly just fast food. I'd prefer sitting by the beach somewhere quieter and nicer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Voyage596555
50,Great beach!,"I really enjoyed this beach. It's clean great restaurants right on the pier, rides and rollercoasters nearby. Probably one of the best beaches in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sabby101
40,A good walk with your better half,You can walk here from venice beach till here. Its a good 20 min walk but worth it on a good day. You can try the different restaurants on your way. There is also an amusement park at the end.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cinesanky
50,Classic Pier,"This is a classic pier with a great history. It seems to have its own personality. The historical development, destruction by weather, threats by politicians and rebuilding over the years is depicted in photos and displays that are interesting. Places to eat, entertainment and beautiful beaches on the blue Pacific. It seems lots of locals here flock to the expansive sand beaches. Even fisherman are lucky, saw a nice-sized flounder caught right off the pier. And with all the crowds, it is surprisingly easy to find parking and get to it. A great day's or few hours' outing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TexWorldTraveler
30,Worth the walk but don't expect too much,"Its worth walking down to the Pier, its a great place to view the long stretch of Santa Monica Beach, there are a couple of good restaurants - The Albright and there is a Bubba Gump. The amusement arcade is very run down however the kids still had a lot of fun playing the old games. so stroll down and enjoy the sea air.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaneMarika
40,Lovely,Lovely view and had a great time. Was good to see an iconic feature that has appeared in so many movies,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bonnybonnykins
50,What a great day out,"The pier is beautiful it has a carnival with the ferris wheel at the end. The day we walked up we had a seal playfully in the water watching everybody. Beautiful beach just like you see in the movies. They have a great mall for shopping, more upmarket but really good fun to walk through and great restaurants. The food is clean and fresh recommend the cheesecake shop on the Veranda, views are outstanding",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annetten964
40,Old America,"Nice old, pretty simple, not huge, beach was not very clean compared to others in America. Some nice restaurants, worth a visit. Looks like America in the movies for us Brits!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/889SS
50,Culturally pleasing,"At the base of the pier is a bubba gump, nice food, but pricey. In the middle there is a carnival with a heap of food options bordering & lots of public toilets. And at the end are a series of steps you can sit on and eat you lunch if you like or often there is live music.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/623christopherh
50,fantastic place,absolutely wonderful venue to walk along or sit and people watch. Very popular on weekends. Plenty of street art/entertainers to stand and watch,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jetett
50,Amusement Park Over the Pacific Ocean,"Amusement park on the Santa Monica Pier. Plenty of rides and entertainment you would expect, for all the family. Also shops and restaurants on the pier. Can be crowded, and pricey, so think about when you go. It's on the ocean, so weather conditions are a big consideration. Be sure to dress appropriately for the winds and temperature. Plenty of paid parking in an adjacent city lot; don't drive onto the pier. A short walk will take you to the town's walking mall area,where there are many things the see, and Many shops to explore. Plenty of nice restaurants too. An all day adventure at the pier and nearby shopping areas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Oceansidedaddy
50,Cool,"Awesome for street music and local talent trying to make it big and some tourist shopping. Rides for the kids, some food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndrewL944

From the pier you have great views of the ocean and the coastline. It's free and there are plenty of shops to look around in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/348kelleyy
40,Fun couples night!,"I had a blast here! Its cheesy, cute and fun. They have a few restaurants to try and when you are done you can enjoy the pier. We had funnel cakes, played games and rode a bunch of rides. The best rides cost 8 dollars a person which is a bit over price. I loved the roller coaster because you get a great view of the beach. If you go at night, it can get cold and windy so bring a hair tie and a sweater!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/esims04
40,Santa Monica pier,"Fun place for the little ones. Very reasonable and affordable with manyactivities to do including rides, bungee jumping, and good food.Close parking in the parking lot which are just a 10 minute walk away. Partly can be quite expensive however.The kids have enjoyable time there. We always go to Santa Monica pier on her vacation to Los Angeles. And I hope you enjoyParking like easy and one of the buildings parking lot adjacent to the area. A short 10 minute walk to the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferi612
40,Nice place to stop off.,We stopped off here while driving through the area. It was a nice place to stop and look at the beach and ocean. We were able to have a good meal and went the aquarium. We watched the sunset which was very beautiful. I'd suggest stopping off here if you're in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NYC2VA13
50,Always a good time at the Pier,Even if you are broke this is a great place to go and walk around the people watching in Santa Monica Pier is fan freaking tastic!! You can have a great time for hours and hours:),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/globetrottergrub
50,A must see!!!,"I travelled with my 16 year old daughter and her friend, they enjoyed this stop very much. We went in February so it was very peaceful and beautiful weather.There were plenty of street performers, fairground rides and restaurants, as well as the iconic Route 66 end of the line sign, all great picture moments.The pier itself was good for a quick walk up and down and the Farris Wheel is a must do!! You can see forever from way up there!A must visit for visitors to LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jessica499
30,Average,"The concept of Santa Monica Pier appeared fun and exciting.......from a distance. Once on the pier it became a little less exciting, a couple souvenir shops, a few homeless people. Can't comment on the amusement park rides since that don't start until 11am.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rodog27
50,Let The Pier take you away....,"Friendships, romance, family time.. The Pier is for everyone and an absolute must-see experience in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebeccaj925
30,"Interesting Pier, decent place to kill a bit of time","I wasn't sure what to expect when I decided to drive to Santa Monica Pier from LA to spend a few hours. I was pleasantly surprised that there was parking on the Pier itself, and not too expensive. There were a few restaurants and the usual t shirt and souvenir shops. Probably the best entertainment were the street musicians sprinkled throughout the pier, but you felt like you had to tip them if you sat and listened (at least a few of them gave that impression). There were lots of amusements for kids, so if I brought children, I probably would give the pier a higher rating. There is a Lappert's icecream store there, which is a favorite of ours from Hawaii. Other than that, there is not much to do, but a decent place to spend an hour strolling up and down the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovestobike
50,Fun attraction in LA,One of the many stops in LA if your in town. Has the whole fair vibe to it in the beach. You can enjoy the rides and the games or just enjoy the view watch the sunset. Highly recommended!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/461edwinc
40,Back to the 50's !,"Just like the old English piers..... side stalls (with prizes just like those of the 50's !!!) But family fun all around you. Rides, mystics, Carousel, roller coaster, pirate ship and more. Home of Bubba Gump too ! Just watch the sun go down from the pier (take your camera's)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Globetrotski
40,Great atmosphere.,Loved the pier.Great huge beach with lots of sand.You can watch seals come up to the pier waiting to steal fish off the fishermen.The rollerfoaster is great fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulAnthonyC_au
50,Cool pier and good fun,"Came here on a bit of a miserable day (weather wise).. But we made the best of it and enjoyed the roller coaster, played some games and enjoyed the shops. Finished off with a meal at the restaurant at the end of the pier!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahtM3053GR
50,A must-see California landmark - the END of Rte 66,"We took a tour of L.A. while visiting San Diego and part of our tour stopped here. It was a strange day for us because it was 2-3 in the afternoon on a sunny day, but the beach and boardwalk was pretty much fogged in !! Our driver told us he had only seen that 2-3 times before at that time of day. But it was very exciting to be there since it is a landmark! There were performers on the boardwalk, one was a magician who was amazing !! We loved seeing this American and L.A. landmark",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PackerGirl70
40,"Lots of interesting characters, much nicer atmosphere than Venice Beach Pier","My husband and I parked along the beach, only had to pay $8 to park and got to enjoy the beach walk. Very interesting little shops along the way to the pier, lots of options for food and shopping. The carnival was very cool, and even the street performers here seem happier and more appreciative than Venice Beach further south. We grabbed ice cream from the Merry Go round place and walked the pier, great views clean water, beautiful beaches",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrazyIrishChic

20,Grungy,"Santa Monica was very nice, and I would definitely return, but the Pier seemed grungy and old. Not much charm. We didn't have time, but I would have loved to rent a bike to ride along the beautiful path than runs along the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/285maryellenr
30,Nice for a short walk,Iconic spot in Santa Monica. Very tourist oriented with souvenir stands restaurants and a small amusement park. Good for an hour or so. Or more with children.Don't miss the historic carousel used in filming The Sting.You can eat here but there are better restaurants along Ocean Avenue.Bring beach stuff if you plan on swimming or sunbathing. Water is cold!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I3850YNdavidw
50,"It's the Santa Monica Pier, what can I say!",Visiting this place after a 14 hour flight made it a bit surreal. We went for a look and a meal and were presently surprised. The view of the sunset from the end of the pier was awesome.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/936haydenb
40,Crowded,"It was crowded but easy to maneuver around. Lots of places to eat. We stopped by Rusty's (see review). Several souvenir shops and, of course, the amusement park. Walked to the end of the pier just to say we did it. Several street performers on board. Interesting place to spend a couple of hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cnanrw
40,Worth a trip.,"We went on a Sunday evening for a wander down the pier at sunset.It seemed that half of California had also decided to do the same as it was packed, although I suppose this was to be expected. On the pier there were plenty of street performers, fairground rides and restaurants, as well as the iconic Route 66 end of the line sign.The pier itself was good for a quick walk up and down, however the highlight had to be walking along the beach from the pier towards Venice beach. Here we were able to pick up food and sit and watch the sunset over the pier and Hollywood hills. As we got further away from the pier, it got a lot quieter and much more pleasant.A must visit for visitors to LA, although would probably advise choosing a quieter time to go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/736laurenw
30,Iconic,Santa Monica pier is one of those must see things while you are in Los Angeles. Not really a lot to do there on the pier itself. There are a few little shops and a small amusement park. I have not gone in the amusement park it seems like it is more for younger kids. There is nice views of the ocean and to be able to see the city of Santa Monica. Was able to watch some Surfers surfing near the pier. The main thing is the beach and the boardwalk that you can walk down towards Venice Beach. You can also rent a bike and go biking up the coast on the nice paved pathways.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zuma1020
30,Disappointing,"Small, touristy and disappointing. Venice seems much nicer. The restaurant we ate at was not good and it was very over priced. The Mexican place at the end of the pier",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamesD803
50,Before and after Disneyland.,"Spent two afternoons there enjoying the weather, people watching and just wandering around. Parked right on the pier for $3 per hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ianbZ9116IB
40,Gppd Family Outing,"The pier was a great time. Took our granddaughter on several rides. She had a great time. Even as packed as the pier was last weekend, we still got on the rides within a reasonable amount of time. It was a bit on the costy side - $8 an adult ticket (each ride) but well worth the adventure for our granddaughter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/349kents
40,"Touristy, but why not?",I enjoyed a stroll down the pier and back. Very crowded on a weekday afternoon. Very touristy. Lots of people and sights to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miles_semple
40,Enjoyed the Pier,"We enjoyed walking to the end of the pier. There were two musicians on the Monday we went. They were quite good and I put money in their boxes. We didn't ride any rides, but they looked fun snd well maintained. We enjoyed walking on the beach beside the pier. There was a wooden walkway on the north side of the pier for people in wheelchairs to get close to the water. It didn't go all the way down to the water, but it got close enough to enjoy the waves. We loved the gorgeous weather!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fairwayBarbie
50,How can you not love this place?,"If you love great rides, fun street acts and a variety of admittedly overpriced fair food, then what's not to love? It's right on the beach and it's a great place to go with the whole family and have fun. The parking can be a bit traumatic, but for CA it's not bad at all. If you're in Santa Monica and don't go you'll kick yourself, and who needs that?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/780tamaram
40,Good for taking tourists here,I saw my only celebrity ever here. John Travolta was with his family here back 2000. Fun stuff to do and it was in the last Grand Theft Auto game.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeMImages
50,Great views,"Went here for the day, at 1st it looked a bit like Blackpool on a sunny day, but once on the pier it changed, great souvenir shops, and bars and great views over the beach and Pacific Ocean .Walked back up to main road and was spoils for choice at all the sea food restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/116stevew116

50,Loved it!,The pier was fun. Lots of high energy. Many shops and restaurants there and a few rides (which we didn't get to go on). Nice place to eat and walk and shop and look at the ocean!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krashzmom
40,End of the road,"This was my furthest stop West on my great spring break trip of 2016. It was a very relaxing stop as we got out, felt the sun, and dipped our toes in the ocean. Very fun for families I would say, a bit touristy for a group of millenials who require constant pandering. I kid, I feel I'm easy to please!Anyway, parking can be done right by the pier, but I parked in a garage a couple blocks away. Weather was nice so I didn't mind the walk. On the pier however, the wind was quite frigid!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U9062ZHalexanders
50,"Very touristy, but fun.","The ferris wheel is only $8 per person, which wasn't too bad. There were a lot of touristy shops, and people walking around. I think it is something everyone should try at least once. The beach was super nasty and littered with trash though. I didn't want to be barefoot on the beach :/ Florida beaches are better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kayla_Chrisman
40,Traditional pier,"Traditional pier loaded with amusements,food stands and a couple of rides.Very lively and popular venue with some typically tacky elements !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsM3853UC

10,Tourist trap,I only briefly encountered the pier but the mad crush of people - on a Monday!- put me off so I swerved away and enjoyed a much better experience exploring and relaxing on either side. It wasn't even an old school kind of charm just seemed tacky. But the rest of the area all the way up and down to Venice Beach was great,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/748richiet
40,Good Fun On A Sunny Day!,"On Sunday afternoon, the pier was crowded but manageable. This is a fun old fashioned amusement park in a unique setting. The ferris wheel and the merry-go-round were fun excursions into the past. Admission to the pier is free, buy tickets for the rides. There are some nice restaurants nearby so you do not have to eat amusement park food unless you want to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/968kippm
30,Scenic and chain touristy.,"I'm always a fan of a pretty beach view and this did not disappoint. A picture from the beach on the southside with the ferris wheel in the background makes for a nice souvenir memory.It was crowded and we didn't venture to the chain restaurants on the pier or the rides.Tip, take an early exit at the bottom of the street ramp to your left across the parking lot and walk downstairs for beach access to avoid the crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Froggy929

50,So much fun!,Visited here with my husband. We had a great time walking on the pier and then we rented bicycles and rode along the beach to Venice and back. So much fun! Must visit if you are in the area....such an experience. Add your time at the pier to your visit to 3rd street promenade and you will have a full day of fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suek692014
40,Beautiful beach and scenery,This is a lovely location and the original Muscle body beautiful beach.Lots of people working out and having a great time.

50,You must come here once in your life,Great fun for young families and people of all ages . Something for everyone! For more value get there early and grab an unlimited ride pass.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/472raymondb
50,Piertastic,The pier exceeded our expectations. The fishing spots were perfect. We even saw two sea lions or seals looking for a free meal. The singers on the pier were talented and friendly. You must try the hotdog food cart that was featured on Food Network. Delicious! This historic landmark must be on your things to see if you are in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Drivenboss
50,Lots to see,There is a lot to see and do on the Santa Monica Pier. Great gift shops and beautiful view! Fun place to stop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/773ron
20,Area Needs an update,"The Santa Monica Pier is a well known icon in need of an update. We were disappointed. It's expensive to park at the Pier. We had a nice lunch walked to the end of the pier and then drove away. The fun park is for children 3 to 7. There needs to be some added entertainment, facilities updates, to the pier area to maintain its icon status.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ozie4
50,Must see when in Santa Monica,"I absolutely love Santa Monica Pier, best to park in the city and walk to the pier if travelling via car. Parking is charged at a premium on the pier.From rides, good food and the aquarium, Santa Monica pier has something to offer everyone for a morning or afternoon stroll. Why not try Bubba Gumps, shrimping good. Or stroll right to the end and witness fisherman hard at work trying to get the daily catch, or listen to the numerous amateur singer talents lined along the pier.Well worth a visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JolanPW
40,Good for strolling around,rent a beach cruiser bike and cycle down Venice boardwalk until Santa Monice pier. The pier itself offers some rides for kids as well as restaurants and coffee shops. Worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E449QIpeterl
30,Worth a brief stop,"Very touristy and filled with all the things you'd expect to find at such a place, but a pretty view of the ocean and good to walk off a bit of lunch after Ivy at the Shore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hollyk28
40,Bustling pier on gorgeous beach,"Spent an enjoyable few afternoon hours walking the beautiful expanse of beach from Venice Beach (with all the surfers) to Santa Monica pier. The beach gets more crowded close to the pier, which is Alice with rides, tourist shops, and buskers. Had a tasty Mexican meal at Mariasol at the end of the pier, enjoying ocean and beach views as well as live music by pier performers. Recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandyg995
40,Pure California,Lovely if somewhat damp afternoon strolling around Santa Monica.You can't come here without walking down here!Better in the sunshine though!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ianr428
40,Great beach. ...,"It was a very windy weather. ...The huge waves and sea water was a very cold but nice. ...My son enjoy getting our feet wet and walking around the pier. ...The Pacific park was a plus. ...Snack shops was good too. ...We basically enjoy our day. ...No matter what you can win a small stuff toy/s on games. ... my son got a small cat stuff toy. ... Just be sure to get the wrist band for unlimited rides and make time for it. ...We enjoy the funnel cake and ice creams. ... it was so yummy. ... plus love the street performer near our table. ...We can see some people are fishing, some walking there dogs, mostly family with young children playing and some are tourist . ...A very nice place for family with young children. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/224phiav
30,Touristy,"Nothing spectacular. Just a pier with lots of standard carnival fare, food etc. nice views but crowded and nothing particular worth doing. A guess a check off the list kind of thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carync6
30,Not what I expected,"Well were do I begin let's see anyone from jersey will understand what I'm about to say this place is like seaside heights. Nothing special very crowded and over priced. The pier itself is small. I mean it's a landmark which is why we visited but don't expect anything special . The beach though has spectacular views as the sun goes down. There is a bubba Gump shrimp on the pier which is nice. Also lots of homeless in this area and lots of weed smoking you can't get away from it the smell is everywhere when walking to the pier not while on the pier though. The third street promenade(outdoor shopping area) a few blocks down is beautiful, worth the trip for that great restaurants and shops. It's a cool area just not that impressed with the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aimrn
40,Good for kids,Great old pier lots going on here. Funfair at end where children given free tokens to use rides/stalls. Lots of shops and lots of restaurants and places to eat including bubba gumps. Great place to very beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BargainH0lidayHunter
50,A must,We never miss a trip to the Pier. One of the highlights is to walk from Venice Breeze Suites along the beach and people watching. This area is one of the most exciting and never fails to impress. 12 trips in 11 yrs and we never get tired of it. See you soon LA. Roll on September 2016.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackandtone6
40,Nice place!,Great for families! Lots of things to do! Nice walk! Food is not that great! Things can be very pricey just like any other touristy destinations.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/176thuyl
30,Once was enough,We went to Santa Monica Pier because that's what you do when in LA. Now that I've seen it I won't be back. It's not how it's pictured on tv however it was an overcast day when we went. It seemed a bit run down and in need of a face lift.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KobiW
40,Nicer than expected!,We went to the pier on a whim and it was great fun! Parking in the garages are cheaper than at the pier itself.There are plenty of shops and eateries and there are fun rides and games for kids (albeit expensive). The Ferris wheel was a fun way to view the area ($8/ticket). The bathrooms in the ride area were surprisingly clean. A few hours is enough to explore the area (maybe more of you bring kids).The beach is beautiful and clean. We ate at Del Fresco across Ocean avenue. We tried the Lobster first but it was way too loud.There are some shady characters hanging around when it gets dark so I wouldn't stay long past sunset.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annahX2815RQ
30,Great to experience if your in the area!,We liked Santa Monica Pier it's got some great little street venders and has a good vibe. Saying that though we did think that there was a lot of hype over it for what it is. Santa Monica is quite expensive to park your car so if you don't mind a walk park on the outskirts which is free and walk to the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Josh_soph
50,Santa Monica Pier,"Such a lovely place. It's fun to visit The Pier. Good to rent a bike or bring your own roller skates. If looking for a lazy day, just bring your blanket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/152kl_rav
20,Fixer upper,Like a lot of Hollywood unfortunately this place is dishevelled. Would have been great twenty years ago. Now it's just a pier with some tat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stich76
40,Good place for fun and food,We enjoyed this area with our 12 year old. Lots of places to eat (we ate at Bubba Gumps) and the view of the beach area from the top of the Ferris wheel was fantastic. Long journey to Hollywood so keep that in mind.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aleminium
40,Best sunset and dinner,My family and I always come here whenever we're in LA. The pier offers a lot of activities and has one of the best sunsets ever. The ferris wheel is the best way to watch the sunset.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/isteyp
40,Large Pier with a Lot of Attractions,You have probably seen this Pier on TV many times. It is a very impressive structure sticking out into the Pacific. Loaded with many attractions. You will find locals and tourists here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yellowpixels
50,Great day out,"Our first day in LA we jumped on a tour bus down to the pier, rode on the Ferris wheel before hiring some bicycles and riding down to Venice beach. Such a great day out, Ferris wheel is worth the $8 just for the photo opportunity. Don't recommend the milkshakes, not much flavour. But hiring bikes and riding the bike trail is a must do!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matt_narelle
40,Good day,We took the hop on hop off bus to Santa Monica which was a great ride in itself. Santa Monica Pier is lovely to walk along. Lots of places to eat. Definitely worth a trip out to have a look.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/353katyf
30,Pier Experience.,"This was the slowest roller coaster I have ever been on. Designed for younger children as it slow's down but my advice would be eight year old's and upwards.The park closed too early in April in reflection to the rides, as we were on our Easter break.Saying that, their were other areas in the park which were open and we enjoyed that. It was good to see the locals fishing at the end of the pier and see the photographs of it's history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/l0rraine611
50,"A lovely place for singles or couples. Couples, your wife/husband will love you.","The only thing hard about it was the parking. Don't drive!!! Take the bus, or some other type of public transportation. Hear me, if you drive your car, you will be sorry! OR get there early. Other than that, Bubba Gumps restaurant, and walking down the boulevard IS THE BOMB! There are other restaurants and attractions. I rode the ferris wheel and the roller coaster, I enjoyed both. If you are in Santa Monica, get here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Driver_316
40,Visit with Family,"Visited So Cal with my wife and 3 children, from Georgia. We enjoyed seeing the people and activity on the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jrcarragher
20,Just Say No!,"I traveled with a group to L.A. for an event, but with a day of play. We chose Santa Monica Pier for that day and we were quickly making other plans. Maybe it was the weather or the fact that it seemed more like a carnival than a fun outing, but we were so disappointed! We were there for about an hour before moving on. Disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CCCDiva
50,FUN!!!!,"We went when it starting to get dark, early April. It was chilly, but we still had so much fun. My son rode every ride probably 10 times each! He's 5 years old. So much to do and play. Great place for family fun activities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KSpalding33
50,Beautiful Social Center,I visited the pier with my sister. This was my first time to CA and the first place I went when my plane landed. I love CA and I love Santa Monica. The pier was a great place to spend part of the day. There is lots of entertainment on the pier and s great Mexican restaurant at the end of the pier. You will find yourself wished away by the tranquility of the sea and the beauty of the landscape.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jezell
50,Spontaneous walk,After a day with Amazing LA Tours we walked down to the end of the pier.

40,Great views,I've been here when it's busy and when it's quiet. I prefer earlier in the morning before everything opens. Walking on the pier is refreshing and has great views.We saw a sea lion off one of the docks along with lots of guys fishing. Not too many homeless people so you feel safe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelamarie0924

People fishing off the end of the pier...didn't see anyone catch any fish though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JstLv2Crz
30,An interesting place to see,We visited the Santa Monica pier while we were in the area. It was a interesting place to see. There were plenty of shops and amusement rides. There was also a wide variety of different things to eat. It's worth a stop if you're in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H1496FFtimh
40,Crowded and not worth the visit,"After spending 15$ for parking, it is a disappointing location. Not much to do. The food is expensive and not particularly good.

30,Well worth the bus ride,"If you're looking to find where Californians hangout, head to the beach. It took about an hour on a red metro bus down the length of Wilshire Blvd to get to Santa Monica Beach and pier costing $1.75 each way. The beach was beautiful and the pier packed with tourists.

30,I've been to many piers....,"...and this one was not good, reminiscent of many of the UK's piers before many of them got their act together in last decade or so. Rather dilapidated feel, terribly touristy. Amusement arcade contained seriously old machines. Didn't try the fairground rides which, to be fair, looked fantastic lit up at night. If you are in Santa Monica, you will probably find yourself wandering on to it at some point, but go with relatively low expectations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonnyc350

Santa Monica Police have a station on the pier so you are safe and unmolested. We enjoyed the people watching, souvenir shopping and riding the Ferris Wheel!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Larry-Crystal
30,Always fun for the kids,"Fun rides and games for the kids. Beautiful scenery for adults. This is an LA icon and should be visited at least once. However, like most tourist destinations, things are overpriced and the businesses are very run of the mill touristy (i.e. Bubba Gump Shrimp Company)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ponderosa72

40,Great atmosphere and location,"Loved the pier and its rides - the big wheel and coaster being the highlights. Bought wrist bands for us all spent an hour their in the morning, returning later that day for sunset (great photo opportunity) and an authentic night time fun fair experience.

50,Great rides and atmosphere,"Carnival food. Carnival rides, priced a little too pricey at $8 a person a ride but get the $20 unlimited wristband for savings. Lots of local musicians and fun. Restrooms. Access to beach. If you go on beach be ready for tar. Bring baby oil or cooking oil to get off. Two blocks from the pier is tons of shopping.

50,Adventures on the pier,Took a walk around and down the pier! It is a touristy spot but I love to experience everything at least once in my life!The views are pretty awesome.

40,Spend an hour or so,"You have to come here because ... Well... It's the Santa Monica Pier! It's pretty standard as piers go with beach shops, fast food and some small rides. It is also right next to a nice beach so you really could hang out for a while. Parking is pretty easy and not too expensive but can get backed up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StefJax

Great place to sit back and have a spot of lunch and watch the goings on in the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dvdr1971
40,Just like the movies,"A buzzing pier at the end of Route 66. Small trinket shops and a boardwalk with panoramic views of the beach, city skyline and surrounding rolling hills.

Parking is available on the pier at a very reasonable cost.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blakeherbert
50,Must see-especially at sunset,We loved Santa Monica pier-visited on our first night in the country-made it just in time for a gorgeous sunset.

40,"Um, Who Doesn't Love the Beach?","Had some free time to hit the coast while on a business trip. Had never been to Santa Monica. The pier was just as cool as it seemed on TV/Movies. Loved the old board walk makeup of it. Lots to do, see, and eat. We mainly took in the views and people watching, as well as grabbed an ice cream cone. We also hopped down onto the beach for a little bit, so our 6-month old could check out the sand, and get his feet wet in the Pacific. All in all a nice place to relax for the day. Next time, I think we may even try out some of the rides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KyleA2402

40,Famous pier worth a look - parking caution,"We heard that this was the famous pier we'd most likely recognize from some TV/movie sightings and that it was worth a visit. It was. But perhaps because the day was so windy, it was good for a stroll out and back and that's about it. No huge time commitment needed, unless you wanted to lay out, eat or go to the ferris wheel or shop for trinkets. Great photo opps, including at the sign noting the end of Route 66. Note that parking is available off a lower road right at the pier. We drove in from the south and jumped at a hotel's parking lot on the coastline road above, which cost us several times the $6 onsite fee. Ouch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amesman96
40,Nice little stroll,"To get my family of 2 teenagers to enjoy themselves on a family vacation is something of a joke. We didn't ride any rides or even touch the sand, but we didn't kill each other, had fun with a magic pier performer when my son was called up to help, and had an ice cream.

40,Very Crowded- Fun Sightseeing Stop,"Visited on a partly cloudy weekend day and was surprised by the number of sunbathers and swimmers on the beach- it wasn't particularly warm! The pier itself was very crowded. There are street musicians along the pier, and other typical touristy kiosks and shops. The rides and Ferris wheel at Pacific park are neat to look at and make a great backdrop for pictures. We didn't ride due to time constraints but they appeared to be well maintained. We had a decent lunch at Pier Burgers- the shakes were phenomenal!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/226rebeccat
40,My son insisted on going,"This isn't a must see when visiting LA. I had my son with me and he wanted to ride the rides. There are a few souvenir shops, maybe a restaurant or two and about 5 rides. The Ferris Wheel has some amazing views and you feel as though you're on the Pacific Ocean. Don't go if you're afraid of heights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AtlRealtor
40,Fun but were there on a cold day,Definitely something to see. Unfortunately were there on a cold and windy day so we didn't stay long. I think it would be great on a pretty day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/franmom
40,Cool,Enjoyed visiting the most famous peer. Lots to see as you walk the entire peer. Street artist are very talented and enjoyable to watch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wfdeacon
50,Great fun on the pier,Lovely old fashioned feel with the benefit of newer restaurants and the rides and attractions. Very busy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katheriner878
40,worth visiting but gets very busy,"We did this as part of the hop on hop off bus, it is worth a visit as long as it is a nice day and you have a few hours just to wander, look at the shops etc. If you have the time you can do the amusement park. Most of the food places had lines but did turn around food pretty quickly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolinedK4224QY
40,Nice day visit,"Lovely pier with interesting attractions for a pier (games, restaurants and a theme park). Pretty heaving though, and traffic is a bit of a nightmare.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pinkelpoops
50,Fun afternoon,"Ideal for fun afternoon, nice walk, lots to see, happy atmosphere, kids will love it, nice restaurants, range of stalls to shop from.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flaassens
40,So much to see!,"Nice beach, nice pier! So much to see like little shops with souvenirs, people who sell self made souvenirs etc, musician. Many people who walk there. We saw seals playing in the water!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alex333berg
30,Nice tourist attraction to spend an hour or 2,"Been here a couple of times, most recently on a family vacation. There's something for everyone - video arcade, amusement park, souvenir stores, food stands, restaurants and of course view of the beach and waves. Pleasant way to spend a couple of hours, nothing much more than that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KhimLee
50,Fun. Must see.,"The iconic Santa Monica Pier is a must see for tourists and locals alike. Plenty of things to eat on the pier. From the latest trendy food on a stick to more traditional sit-down seafood restaurants. Street performers and artists line the sides and local fisherman at the end trying to catch a little sum-sumthin for dinner.Then, of course, there's the entire amusement park. Rides, midway games and an arcade. Major family fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jtlerman
40,A must see,"The beaches were beautiful! Pier was just what I thought, awesome. Would be a fun day trip with kids. Even saw see lions at the end of the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marieb959
40,The Main Attraction!,"This jewel in Santa Monica's crown is fantastic. I've been to a few seaside fun park/piers and there's a nice authentic, timeless charm about this one. Irregular (but sturdy) planks, quaint fairground attractions that need to be seen in the evening as the light show is impressive and half decent food joints make this well worth visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeeC5
30,"The place is beautiful, but","So expensive!! It is $8 per person, per ride to ride the roller coaster and that price is regardless of age. The place becomes very expensive very quickly. The lights of the pier are absolutely beautiful as an addition to looking out at the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plancarte307
40,Lovely place to relax,"I sat here on the pier just to enjoy the sights and sounds and eat some lunch. It wasn't too busy at this time of the year, and there was some unusual activities you don't normally get at a pier (eg the Trapeze school).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HuzKa
50,Stroll before dinner at Blue plate,My family has been here 4 months ago. I was last here over 20 years ago. So impressions then was pretty hazy. The huge wooden boardwalk was charming and as the evening sunsets it's teeming with crowds on a very chilly night out. Lots of small stores along with live music entertainment. Artistes and bust carvers on hand to custom anything for you. Lots of ice cream and sweets peddlers and the carnival park for rides. It's worth 2 hours without food and could be a lot more if you include rides and a meal. Good view of the coast lines before dark and the night view is great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/854colint
50,Kids loved it,"13, 11 & 8 had a blast just goofing around on the attractions. It's not a super polished, super-smiley theme park but it isn't really meant to be. Just go with an open mind and with the intention of having fun. Kids especially thought the big tyre dodgems was brilliant and couldn't get enough!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aussie_possie
50,A must do!,We love going to the pier every time we visit LA.It's not going to be for everyone as there are lots of people and kids.But it's a must do for your bucket list if you're in town.I like the carnival type food that you can purchase on the pier.Also lines for the rides are very reasonable.Let's not forget the spectacular view!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hearty_Traveller_11
30,A tourist attraction but a bit of fun.,Quite touristy but a bit of fun. The beach is very nice.We found it easy to get there on public transport.The walk along Muscle Beach to the pier is fun. Lots to see. Hiring a bike is a nice way to get along.The pier is colourful and has the usual souvenir shops and food outlets.Some good photo opportunities here and the kids love it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brisdi
50,Love it,"We stop here every year on our spring break trip. Love the family friendly rides and vibe. Just a really cool visit. For better food and prices, stay off the pier. We ate at a tiny little joint on the street at the end of the pier. Super reasonable, fast, and great clam chowder and also chili bread bowls. Wish I could remember the name.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J7792ZQjulieb
50,Cool place!,"Cool and fun place to go to during the day or night! Fun place for people of all ages! Either to go on rides, enjoy food, enjoy views, or shops! A must go when in the area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darynkag
30,Extremely crowded,It was extremely crowded place with zero romantic feelings as I though when I was watching to a photos on Internet. This is too commercial place. Manhattan Pier is MUCH better!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blechaluk
30,Touristy arcade and pier,"Since we were staying up the road, we figured we would visit the Pier to see what was going on. There is a small amusement park but mostly it is just a touristy area with people selling wares and performing. There were 2 sea lions right in the water swimming around and looking for food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andym207
40,Must see,Santa Monica Pier was a lot of fun. Great people watching. Went and it was a bit cold but over all a must see when you are in LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ausjaz1234
40,A historic pier that charms all,"Built in 1909, it is certainly a piece of history that charms you the moment you step onto it or rather set your eyes on it.Take a stroll, watch people, gaze at the sea, eat and drink or simply ride on the historic wooden horse carousel, you can do all these and probably some more.A great place to spend some time.......",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kent19
50,Crowded but still fun!!!,We've got there mid afternoon and it was packed with people but still fun. Worth the visit id you like people watching. The weather was fantastic!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertoG835
40,"Good, but expensive...","We thought this pier was a great place to visit, but the rides were really quite expensive!! $8 for one ride! I know you can get a wrist pass, but if you only want to go on a couple of things it makes it a very expensive visit.The parking on the pier was good, being up higher from the sand blasting of the beach area.We walked from here in to the main shopping area.I found out that this pier was where the idea of Popeye began, love things like that!!My children loved the arcade & the balloon popping game, lots of fun to be had with those games.Carole : )",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaroleScott
30,Too crowded!!!!,"This place is full of people! Food is not so good. They advertise they have a lot of food carts but I only saw two kinds. hot dogs and churros. They do have Taco bell and 2 more spots of burgers and pizza and maybe some icecreams and creps, but nothing WOW! Food is not a good thing here. just som fun for kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VeroMP
40,Great people watching,"We spent about 30 mins walking up and down the pier last Saturday after spending an afternoon at the beach. Lots of ""interesting"" people and attractions. Very fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrstats69
40,A pleasant area.,"We arrived early, around 10am and things were just opening up, it was nice to have a stroll along to the end and see the fishermen, we had a coffee then took the kids down to the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soniaE_12
40,So Fun!!,"Great people watching place. Lots of things to do. Don't miss the inside carousel at the beginning of the pier for a very affordable ride. Lots of places to eat, music to listen to and shopping. Parking available on the pier. Go - it's really fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theheatonfamily
50,Great experience,My first time in California and so happy I got to experience Santa Monica. The views are amazing. Lots of people and very busy. But worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leeleemarie81
50,N trincilla,My kids love it here. Al day wristband is $30. Not that many rides but the rides that are there are pretty fun. And the view of beach is great too,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/levytrin
40,Wish we stayed longer,This iconic location was a priority for me. Nice area where you can do a lot or just relax by the beach. I could see that parking would be a problem in busier months though. Hopefully we can come back some day to spend more time there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patlv23
40,Worth the walk,"To start the weather was windy and in the low 60's. The pier is nice to walk out and take pictures. Places to eat had good and bad reviews, some are a chain. Looked like kids would like the actives on the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleysN2586TR
40,Nice walk on the pier,Nice walk on the peir but very windy just as well we wrapped up warm the rides were very busy and cost between 4-8 dollars per ride you buy a wristband for unlimited use we decided just to walk because they were so busyPlenty of food outlets although a little expensive again they were crowdedLovely views down both beaches,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Legoman1958
50,Awesome atmosphere!!,"This pier makes you move back into time.. And that's how we started our trip on the Mother Road aka Route 66..The pier is dotted with shops, kiosks, eating places. The atmosphere is fun and joyful. Souvenirs too are not exorbitantly priced.It's a good place to chill and hang out all through your evening.Take a few rides on some old time rides and let this time machine of a place take you back in time.Loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/51rashmim
40,Busy but cool,Long weekend and Spring breaks made for a busy pier but the weather and attractions made up for it. Plan to arrive with some time to get in and down there. It's a longer walk than it looks like from Ocean Ave. especially when you have a bike and/or littles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mjames2016
50,A unique experience of California style enterntainment.,"The place is just great in food, scene an plain fun. Great place to go with kids and adults. Don't miss the restaurants and the games.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/677ricardoa
50,Fun,"If you're on Santa Monica visiting you have to go to the pier! Fun area - rides for the kids, a little shopping and great views. Highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TH0718A
40,Unique place,"Loved the ambiance, the beach, the park and the restaurants. Very good stores close by. The pier is a great place to spend the day and relax. Loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/347SandraM
40,Fun but overcrowded,The Pier gets mobbed on the weekends and very crowded later in the day taking the fun out of the place. If you go I would go as early as possible on week day when you can enjoy its low key family friendly charm.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spirited-wanderings
40,A must do!,Do it ! Eat at Pier burger ; ride the new Ferris wheel and just be that tourist family for a few hours around sunset !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hotelchik

50,Fun fun fun,"A playground for all ages, a must do is the Ferris wheel, the view is phenomenal. All day entertainment provided by the buskers, crowds and fishermen. We enjoyed a Mexican lunch and just to make the visit perfect a sea lion put on a show in the ocean by the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samanthawD2713FB
40,Great on a lovely day,A very pleasant place to visit... great backdrop and scenery surrounding it but the carousel is gorgeous and a real attraction... the end of route 66,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigBrank
30,"Worth a visit, but not a destination","The Santa Monica pier, is a good part of a day trip to the California coast, but it is not the sole reason to go. The pier has a lot of cheap clothing and souvenirs, a few interesting rides and some great views of the beach, but would not entertain for a whole day.It is however an icon of the area and must be visited, and is located on miles of beautiful beach which makes it a must for any tourist looking for a real feel of California life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rockkevin6
40,Not as exciting as I was expecting!,The day was beautiful but not warm enough for us to take a swim so we just walked the pier and took in the scenery. It was a really beautiful beach and there were heaps of people on the beach and on the pier but it just didn't have the carnival atmosphere I was expecting. There were a couple of shops and some buskers but nothing exciting enough to keep us there for more than an hour or so. After Universal studios the rides didn't compare so the kids weren't interested. The thing we got the most amusement from was seeing the Zoltar Fortune Telling Machine from the movie 'Big' and telling the story to our teenager.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/20grace13
40,Fun,Great to finally walk the pier. We all rode the Rollercoaster. Good fun great view.Spent some time on the beach. Was already very busy in March.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ciaobaby40
50,A must visit,"It's hard to describe why this is a must visit attraction. It's like a carnival atmosphere when lots of people are there, an amusement park with some quality cuisine on offer. The night time is certainly pretty with lights and rides for the children (and grown ups alike). The day time was relaxed with good buskers and activities to watch. It's not a huge place but certainly worth a visit to see the historic carousel (or merry go round), the trapeze school, Ferris wheel and roller coaster. Grab a selfie with the Route 66 sign too. Lots of Pelicans about and a great view up the beach with the iconic life guard structures in this great open space makes for wonderful photography. We dropped by twice for the burgers there, they were busy but worth the wait. Seafood seemed a popular choice too, and a gaming arcade appeared popular with the younger people. A good range of souvenirs available and access to the walking track if you're up for a stroll.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geoffc967
50,"Beautiful at night, shopping in the day","We went with our kids at night, we went to the arcade and amusement park and burritos for dinner. Before hand we went to the shops. Great walk and atmosphere with buskers playing great music.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bthorn88
40,Nice place to visit,"This was our first time in Santa Monica, and the pier was great! We spent a long time just looking at the turquoise waves rolling into the shore and crashing into squealing visitors. The only downside was that the beach was BUSY. And by that, I mean REALLY BUSY. The whole shore was covered with visitors and bright umbrellas!We took a walk along the pier, seeing many people singing, caricaturing, drawing and sculpting for money. We also got to see a big brown seal bobbing up and down in the waves!This is a great place to go in Santa Monica, but make sure to bring jackets - it can get pretty cold down there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Homelover69
30,Nice way to watch the sunset.,"We enjoyed walking on the beach, heading to the end of the pier and watching the sunset. It was a little busy and crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zolnier2
30,Touristy: Beautiful view of the ocean and sunset. Otherwise dated,"I take visitors to the Santa Monica Pier because it offers a beautiful view of the state beach, distant mountains of Ventura and a stunning sunset. Plus the state beach is right there with free admission and dozens of volleyball courts in one area of the beach. It's free to board the pier and walk up to rides or restaurants, but riding requires tickets purchased on site. The arcade accepts cash on site. The restaurants are chains, so I eat at the Promenade instead. **Parking is $10-20, so try to find cheaper street parking across the pier or near/behind the Promenade and walk over. There's a great board walk on the land, just above the beach and before the pier--it's great for strolling or running. Head back to the Promenade after for shopping, dining and people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coryk422
30,People are Crazy,"If you like watching people, go here. If you want a casual stroll, don't. The highlight of this last visit was coming across a young man getting on one knee and proposing to his girlfriend! Pretty neat to witness.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brian-Pamela
20,TOO TOURISTY!!!,"Over crowded. Overrated. Nothing worth buying or eating here. Nice view of the beach though! And I guess if you like to ""people watch"" this place could be considered interesting!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cynthia562014
50,"i loved this place, wooden walkways great shops, fishermen, and games for kids","I saw this on food network so i wanted to go see it and it was very enjoyable from the people singing on pier for tips, fishermen trying to keep the sea lions from taking their bait, amusement parks all very fun and enjoyable. Crowded but alot of fun !!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gatorhans

50,Couples trip,My husband and I from FL visited Santa Monica pier during our trip to Pasadena. We really enjoyed the pier. Lots to see and do. We enjoyed the local vendors who were selling art work. We actually bought a piece as a souvenir/gift for a friend back home. Beautiful views at the beach. We have a lot of stunning photos from the sunset we experienced. Nice place!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DiHoss413
30,great for the kids,We were in town for 3 days and found sunday the best as the Pier was full of stalls.Great place for the kids with the old amusement rides ... too bad the height restriction stops us from going on them !The beach is nice to stroll down (even when windy).Some of the stores look tired.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/w00fies
40,Must see,Watched the sun set from the pier and it was awesome! Lost of food and rides. Great for kids families. Must see attractions. Stay away if you don't like crowds and dirty beaches.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charthomas3
50,Spring break in California,"This is our first time here... Vey busy place with plenty to do for everyone of all ages. We went to the amusement park, but I feel it's a bit expensive for such a small place.. About 27.00 per person unlimited rides . On the beaches there are trails for walks and bikes and many other things that have wheels! Beautiful beaches with mountains to the side...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/448JulieP448

40,Quintessential Place to Stop,"Hey if your driving past you have to stop.First stop on a long road trip from LA to San Fran after getting off a 14hr flight.Great pier for a walk, we were really early hence didn't go to any of the attractions but had a lovely crisp morning, walked the pier and fuelled up on some coffee and burgers (which were great).I imagine this place would be pumping in the summertime, we were there in January, but actually thought it looked beautiful in the winter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MattGG
40,Main attraction in Santa Monica with great atmosphere,"I think this place was not too special. But what made it special was the atmosphere and the crowd! People came from all over the world just walking along the pier, taking pictures, eating, enjoying the amusement park. Such a great crowd! And I was one of them.... I came at the right time in the afternoon just before the sunset so I could enjoy it. Not a perfect one but it was great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlbertNoers
40,Essential SoCal visit,"I haven't been to the Santa Monica pier since I was a kid. We were in the neighborhood and stopped by for a visit. Lots of tourists, super busy place with a carnival type atmosphere. A few places to eat, but more than anything, a great place to people watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rockshaun
40,A people watching spot,"It was about 30 celsius when we visited Santa Monica so a visit to the pier was a perfect chance to sit enjoy the sun and do some people watching.It is such a busy place with so much going on - restaurants, music, hawkers, kids, couples, olides and a fun fair. There really is something for everyone and everyone really does visit. It looks quite old and worn in places but there must never be a quiet time for any renovation to take place.We grabbed a coffee and sat and listened to a musician and watched the world go by. Not sure there was a lot there to make a day of it unless you combined it with a day at the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pogwig
50,Rainy day is still okay...,Was only in LA for 36 hours to see Kobe play before he retired. Chose to visit Santa Monica over Hollywood and I couldn't have had more fun!! I was about half way down Santa Monica Pier when it started to pour with rain. I took cover in Playland Arcade and played video games for the next hour...such a great time!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H606BLdanb
40,Great day!,"We walked around the pier at 10ish, then rented bikes and rode all along Venice and a little further. If you plan to rent bikes, rent them under the pier ( $20 for the whole day!!). Parking along the beach is only $6, but hourly up on the pier. Lots of fun shopping, goings on and people watching. We ate at Simzy's in Venice beach. Fish tacos were excellent!! And they had an ever rotating board of beers! Great find and our server was great! Kids had the stuffed apple pie donut for dessert! Mm, mm, mm! We hit the beach after and played in the waves, so fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/6ettin-out-there-
40,Good clean family fun!,"Fun small amusement park... I believe there are some good coupons on line,bso check thosebout. Most rides are $8, so of u plan 9n going on more than 4, get the wrist band pass.

50,Day and night excitement!,"Old fashioned carnival with games and amusement rides, a variety of very talented musicians and singers abound, fishing off the pier, great for people watching, down below on the beach or on the pier itself, interesting history of the pier told through pictures. neat place to visit! The pier is free, but the amusement park rides and games are not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dhvh

50,The Pier followed by walking the 3rd street Promenade is a perfect day,"Santa Monica Pier is a great LA Beach experience. Lots to see, rides, attractions. Then go down to the sand, and after shop and window shop at 3rd St Promenade. Lots of fantastic stores, along with amazing street entertainment You literally can spend the day and night here, and find so many great places to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyFi18
50,Beauty on the beach.,"I was lucky enough to see Kazaa, the Cirque de Soleil show on the beach in the tent. It was truly amazing watching these incredible athletes and performers go through their stunts and actions. Multi talented with amazing skills. Cirque shows are to be savoured like the food and the service at the adjacent restaurant the Lobster. First class service and you have to have the Caesar salad with your steaming hot lobster. I will always remember my wonderful experiences on the Pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spirit6victoria
50,My Favorite Beach,"Santa Monica beach is by far my favorite beach ever! I love the vibes, the people are so nice and friendly, the pier is amazing (there's so many shops, rides, games, food, etc.), and more. There's so much to do I never end up swimming in the ocean I just hang out on the pier. It is crowded, but so worth it. The view and sunsets on the pier are so amazing. Also, the pier lights up at night, which is so beautiful. Make sure to bring a camera for sights and money for games, food, and rides!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelaHutchison
30,Enjoyable Stroll,"While staying in nearby Venice Beach, we walked up the well-designed sidewalks and walkways to the Pier.It was mid-afternoon on a sunny Wednesday and the area was packed with tourists and locals. The pier itself does have a few rough spots, being a real wooden deck, so you do have to watch your footing while dodging strollers and street artists.It was fun to walk along, feel the ocean breeze, and see the ""sights"" but I wouldn't recommend spending any money. There are better restaurants in Santa Monica and more fun to be had (for free) playing in the sand along the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcast27
40,Not exactly what I expected,"It was my first time going to the Pier and it was a weekday night. It was kind of cool, but also kind of underwhelming. It wasn't very crowded, and going to the end of the pier was nice with some guy playing some cool music. However, the park part of it all was kind of underwhelming and a little trashy. The roller coaster looked quite boring and there were only 2-3 people on each round. No wonder.. the prices are insane for a boring ride. If I did any of the arcade/ rides thing, it'd be the ferris wheel. If you are in the area, I'd suggest going in the early afternoon to spend time at the beach, have dinner and then watch the sunset from the pier. I wouldn't make the trek up here if you are are staying in Anaheim for Disneyland, etc. Can be cool, just not worth any hassle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kdub_lewis
40,Ok,"Not my thing really but lots to look at and a few places to eat.It is very popular, always loads of people there.Felt safe enough, just not my thing",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mafco
50,Great walk,Inviting atmosphere and beautiful weather. The restaurants were a little too pricey. But it is fairly crowded. The beach is open and large.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hakymr2016
50,The pier,"Really cool spot , the pier is full of little shops and food stalls with a fun fair at the end that's seen in so many movies so great to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindsayC599
30,Sight seeing and dinner,Good visit for teenagers. Food was OK. What you would expect from fast food places at a fair ground. Bring a jacket as it can be cold in the evening.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Family-Photog
30,Crowded,"Living in the hostel on 2nd Street I took the walk the first evening in Santa Monica. Crowded like nothing. You have a great view and maybe get some nice pictures at dusk/dawn. Itherwise it is very touristy, overpriced and who knows the quality.I was mostly hanging on to my purse not to be picpocket...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelelg
40,Interesting Place,"As the end of Route 66, this place has historic, scenic, and entertainment value. We brought a group of college students to spend a couple hours enjoying the various entertainers (pigeon man, magician, singers), shops, and activities (beach, ferris wheel, etc.). They enjoyed their time and found the ""people watching"" to be fascinating.The only downside is the traffic. We were there on a weekday at midday. We found very reasonably priced parking right at the pier, but getting there (and out again) was a bear. The one expressway approaching it was jam packed and the surface roads were equally awful. That's LA, I guess.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlumniGuy
40,Iconic sight,"The pier is itself is very nice and offers lots to do and see. There's restaurants, street vendors, street performers, rides, and more. It is very busy however and very touristy. We also had a very hard time finding parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmabJ4719EC
30,Nice place,Its lovely and stunning but very busy and expensive. Its really cold on a night so wrap up warm!I really recommend going on the ferris wheel.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleighnicolem
30,Iconic...but not a must see,"The worst thing about LA is the traffic...getting to the Pier will take you the better part of a day. Once you arrive, parking is easy enough to find in the parking structure and there are things to see on the Pier, but it isn't a must see. The food is overpriced and it's crowded but if you are there for the ocean...it's a nice stop! The beach had great sand and you can't beat those waves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmgart
10,"Dirty, needs up keep","For all the times you've probably seen this icon on TV or have driven by it, I think you might want to actually pass on coming here especially if you have small children. This area has so many homeless people asking for money, rowdy adults, and dirty trash all over. Instead, maybe a stay on the promenade will serve you better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamezn2014
50,Loved it,"I loved that walk at the beach and after that to go to the pier to see all the attractions and things I had always seen in TV. It's worthy going as you cannot go to LA and just miss this. It's a must, whether you like it or not, that's none of my business, but it's an amazing place and at night is really cool with all those lights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/14paum
30,Ok for a while.,Went here on a trip and stayed for a while it was alright but not great.Most of the stalls were closed and the fair was half closed as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/168terenceg
50,Had a blast,"Had a great time on the pier. Bought the unlimited ride wristband and enjoyed the rides. If you are looking for a thrilling roller coaster this is not your place. The rides were exciting enough though and have a great view. If it's not too busy they let you ride twice. Plenty of carnival type attractions, shopping and food for every one to find something they enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Love2hvfun
20,Not for people with ornithophobia,"Seagulls are EVERYWHERE to be seen and almost felt. They fly right above your heads. In this time of the year it is cold and windy, so maybe you should weat jeans and a sweater, which is something uncompatible to go to the beach... I went in the afternoon and I'm guessing it looks better at night with all the lights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mqueliz
50,Magical Place,"within easy walking distance of down town Santa Monica,.. Bristling with eateries, & bars, and souvenir shops,.....Free musical street entertainment,.....and the amusement park,. and great views of the beach,...A Place you will remember for ever",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aultz
40,Fun experience,"Interesting, fun things to see and do. Neat to see the end of Route 66. Great beach access just off pier. Was a fun experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EAPiscool
40,"Good Mexican Food, Better Funnel Cake","This is a place that you must visit if in Los Angeles. Although it may seem similar to other piers and can be crowded, the Santa Monica Pier is a destination that you'll want to say you visited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristianSamuel
20,You only need to see this once,Very touristy and grungy. Not enough nice shops and food places. Can take some nice pictures of the coast from the pier .. But not much to do other than that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TobyMaxie
40,Standard pier,"This place is very busy and I can only imagine how much busier it can get in the summer! One of the places to tick off the list when travelling to LA. Parking was a breeze, great views of the coastline from the pier. Definitely worth a walk down the coast once you've been here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BradCymru
10,Its just not cool,"First time visiting the peer, must say i was not at all impressed, from the access point to the end. They should have kept it clean, without shops and carnival style rides. Just go to the beach instead and stay there.That's it folks. Hope you Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denisd147
50,Seems to be in a tv show,"The pier and the beach are exactly as seen in movies and tv shows, especially during weekends. The crowd walking around, young people playing all sorts of sports, the ocean, the sun...everything contributes to the wonderful atmosphere you can breath there. It seems you are dreaming...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Antonella2007
30,Touristy but still a must do,We went with two teen daughters on a Thursday night. We parked a couple blocks inland for free and walked to the pier. Seemed very commercial. Typical street fair stuff. Nothing special as far as food or entertainment. Still worth walking through and taking a couple pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/havefunh0ust0n
20,Not worth it for most people,"Fun to read all the five star reviews - there are plenty of beach piers with rides on the east and gulf coasts that are cleaner, nicer and not full of panhandlers and homeless to the extent this is. I get in Southern California this is a bit of an iconic attraction but it goes in the same book as the Holywood walk of fame or manns Chinese theater. Just drive by it and you'll be just as happy. If you're from western states where these things are a novelty than caveat emptor. Really I think the city should put some money into it and clean up the vagrants and peddlers. I'll not ever need to see it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KMR042
50,Beautiful,"Awesome! Fun pier - we parked the car and walked around the pier. There's restaurants, shops, theme parks, etc my favorite was a guy playing a guitar by the sea",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariagR5849ME
50,Can't wait to go again!!,"Visited for the first time yesterday & me & my daughters LOVED it!! It was the highlight of our vacation. My youngest is in a wheelchair & they were extremely courteous & understanding to us. They allowed us to enter the rides via the exit, which really helped when it came to dealing with the wheelchair. Definitely planning another visit soon!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tccooks84
50,Beautiful paradise,I visited this on my way back to LAX and I regret because I needed a full day unrushed. It is an absolutely beautiful place to spend the day. Will make some time next time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenthebem
30,Quick and easy - basic amusement park plus food and bikes,"Fun rides, some games, but this was an easy fun place to visit. Decent food selection close by including a Starbucks. Sit down restaurants as well that are fair to decent dining choices. You can rent bikes close by and bike around along the beach path.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DylanJ944
50,Absolutely just as I remember it from when I grew up in L.A.,My review is a little late. We took our kids for my oldest 9th birthday. We couldn't do Disneyland or Knotts due to financial reasons. But decided to get them to experience something different. Boy did this trip bring back some wonderful memories of growing up in Los Angeles. Being that we're from San Diego. We have nothing like this. My daughter braved her fear and got on her 1st coaster. My boys did the alligator ride. But the highlight of the trip was the shark museum. I do apologize to the employs there. My kids were a bit to excited and tried to grab on to one of the sand sharks. But wow. What a wonderful day it was. Hope to make it back soon :0),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TereG_12
50,Must see,It was a great day to go.. Loved the people watching going on. Love that so much diversity. If you get a chance well worth the drive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jc302015
40,You can't come to LA and not go to the pier.,"Visited the pier, it is a must see on any tourist list. Okay during the day, lovely at night with the attraction lights on. Typical tourist spot, nice views of the beach and overpriced souvenirs but very glad we visited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cherylmC491IA
40,Nice,Great place beach needs to be maintained though there was lots of trash wish there was more dining close by with easy parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/378vanec
50,Fun place to get your kicks,"Located at the end of Route 66, the pier offers a vast array of family entertainment. A Ferris wheel with breathtaking views of the pacific, a roller coaster, the buccaneer rise, and lots of midway and arcade games. Very clean, not rowdy, and plenty of places to eat (ristorante and bubba gump). And don't forget to get funnel cake at scoops!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danfriedmanmd
40,"Fun, but....","Took our three year old granddaughter out to the pier to ride the rides and see the sights. An all day pass is almost mandatory for anyone wishing to play on the rides; we bought a single adult ticket for Grandpa for the ride where our grandchild was not quite tall enough to ride alone. There are about six rides suitable for young children, and she rode them all, many twice and had a great time. There was not a lot of time spent waiting, and the rides were about the right length of time for short attention span children. The park attendees were friendly and helpful and all was good. When we went to get some snacks and some ice cream things were not so wonderful. Pricing is ridiculous, bordering on price gouging, and the service was unbelievably slow at the concessions we visited. Seating space was barely adequate even for the relatively uncrowded day. Plenty of parking--we parked in the short term lot for a dollar an hour which was a steal but there is an all day lot as well for those with more stamina. Overall a good score, but the quality, quantity, and value of the food concessions needs to catch up to today's standards",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Electric2
40,Wonderful walk on the beach...must visit,"We drove here after a day in UCLA, touring the school. The traffic was long but it's all worth it. People are just enjoying the day swimming or just relaxing. Its a good place to visit, to relax and just enjoy the sound of water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WOW_mom93

40,Busy but fun,Has to be done if in Santa Monica but a bit like all piers - full of tat and busy resturants. The big wheel was fairly crap - ages to load up and then just a couple of turns,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WestSussexGooner
50,A lot of fun with family and friends,"Loved this pier. Have a lot activities to do. I liked the rides and wheel wow what a view of the city. If you go in evening the lights on the wheel are awesome.Lot places to eat, games and vendors. If you have time to visit only one beach and want to have entertainment this would be the beach of choice.Walk to the end of pier for a good view of ocean and u might get to hear some live music.We sat on the steps facing ocean quiet scenic.The beach is safe as they have police patrol.Off course beautiful beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TadA232
50,Great place,Really enjoyed the pier and pier area. Nice/clean/felt safe. Visited during the day and at night. Looks beautiful at night all lite up. Very nice area on a great beach. Worth a visit. Don't forget to get a picture of yourself at the end of Route 66 sign!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SUXDSM
30,Chaotic but fun to see...once,The pier is iconic to Santa Monica. You must go out just to experience it.We ate at the restaurant on the end. We grabbed a quick bite to eat with fajitas and drinks.We did not ride any of the rides..but would have if we had time.It's a carnival scene packed with people..but worth seeing once.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HoneyPopWallis
50,Pity about being so full,Wanted to eat at the end of the pier but the wait was over an hour. When you haven't got that much time you can't sit around.We also saw a pelican sitting in this pier - a great find.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chantellehowes
50,An annual must,My grandson visits every summer & this is his favorite place to go & I do not get tired of taking him. He started going when he was 6 & & at 14 still asks to go. Beautiful setting on the ocean. Typical small amusement park rides but the atmosphere is fun & upbeat. Of course for this grandma the Ferris wheel is a must.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ConnieL1950
30,Predictably Tacky.,"Very nice views and that's about it. Very tacky, much like an amusement park. Not even any good restaurants along the pier",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dwmv65

50,Must visit!,"The Santa Monica Pier is an icon you have to visit when in LA. We had the opportunity of taking amazing pictures, and be prepared to be surrounded by giant seagulls. There's a carnival, lots of food, great little shops and spots, and great sunset views. You will not regret this experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ameliareal
50,Santa Monica pier,"Really good place to spend a few hours, end of the famous Route 66, indoor carousel, and roller coaster with plenty of places to eat. Right on the beach that takes you to Venice beach , cycle, skateboard and surfboard hire close by.Don't forget to take a camera 😎",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Malc1996
40,Last stop on route 66......,"This is the last stop on Route 66. This is your typical pier boardwalk with restaurants, shops and vendors. They have this Japanese hot-dog vendor that sells hotdogs with seaweed and other toppings. You have to try when you get there. Also there is a churro vendor that is delicious. You have to be careful when eating though as the seagulls will take your food from you right out of your hands. They also have a mini amusement park with a Ferris wheel and other rides. This is great for families with small kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/masonalpha9603

30,Just ok,"The place looks good, and it's nice to see the ocean, but there isn't much to do in the pier (may be good to families with children because of the little amusement park on the pier).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Assaffri
40,Amazing views and feel,Loved walking the pier on my recent visit. I was pushing an infant in a stroller and it was a bit bumpy. The shops and drinks from the vending machines are really overpriced. But the pier and view and weather could put anyone in a good mood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SKramer2014
50,Great Time!!!,"You cannot go wrong visiting the pier!!! Lots of rides, games, food and great for kids. Beautiful view and beach too!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/673deba
50,a great place to visit with a great view of the ocean,"There is nothing like the santa monica pier. Its not even expensive like going to an amusement park but it will give the kids and you the same fun.A lot of rides , games, food and the view is outstanding. Its clean and efficient so lines move.The crowd is not rowdy safe to bring the family in. The kids would love it. I take my grandson there as often as I can and he loves it. unlimited rides ticket is the best way to go. Weekdays is the less crowd. I hope this helps.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mcarm

50,road construction and expensive to park,Road construction and we were new to the area so we overpaid to park $20 Cheaper parking around the area so look for it. We paid $8 the next weekend in a different location. Entertainment scattered along the pier and we say a cute sea lion,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShanaG_11
50,Must see in LA,Pier full of people. End of Route 66. Beach wide and nice. What else do you want when you travel? If you want a quiet place don't come here. Just on the left of the pier is the Santa Monica muscle beach. Go and enjoy people having fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Me74126500
40,Fun,Fun place to go with the kids. Roller coaster was fun but ended quickly. Parking lot is hard to get to if you're coming from the south. You have to do a U turn and backtrack.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/warreng999
50,Santa Monica pier,Had great afternoon at the pier. Kids loved the carnival and rides. On a warm day the beach would be great. For fans of Route 66 I recommend visiting the Route 66 kiosk on the pier as they have some great information and facts about the old highway.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/402brendanb
40,Fun,"It was cold when we were here but it was a lot of fun. Walked up and down the pier, rode the ferris wheel, very romantic. I got an ice cream cone and it wasn't very good. I would love to come back when its warmer and go down to the beach. I could see this being a very crowded place in the summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lucks729
30,Nice bad sad to see so many homeless people,"What a nice city and the pier was excellent to see. Well worth a visit for everyone, only word of warning is to be prepared to see a lot and I mean a lot of homeless people, which was truly sad and some change goes a long way, only wish the US government would help these people more",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PNMO1978
50,Always a Treat... beautiful sunset here.,"I absolutely love the Santa Monica pier. Unobstructed Pacific Ocean views are the highlight when you reach the end, with all kinds of great people watching, vendors, food (including great funnel cake), an amusement park and entertainment along the way. Also a wonderful place to watch the sunset. must see for any visit to LA. Recommend parking (off the Pacific Coast Hwy) right under the pier which was reasonably priced at less than $10.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theOneiricTraveler

40,Much fun!,"Have been here many times. There are plenty of carnival rides to go on, carousells, and food to eat on the pier. Even if you're not interested in these activities, it's still fun to go and hang around particularly on a nice day. This is located near plenty of interesting things in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rduinc
40,Relaxing,"I had some spare time one of my days in LA and I decided to come here after I've heard about the place.Place is well kept, clean and organized to a certain extent (not many people were there). I walked around the pier enjoying the view and ended up staying at the end of it for a good 30 min enjoying the water with some great background music (street performer).I just wish there weren't so many performers in the area. To much background noise from their performances. There was one every 10 meters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luiscX4398ZK

50,The Jersey Shore of The West Coast,If you love carnivals and the smell of the ocean this is the place for you. We had such a good time!

30,Great for a change of pace,Arrived at Santa Monica pier on the hop in hop off bus which I must add is a joke if trying to locate stops throughout route ... Anyway the Pier has lots for all ... Fun rides great dining and an awesome Route 66 stand the guy is the most knowledgable on this iconic route ... Cheers,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrevHoltham
40,Bike Ride around the pier,"One of my favorite moments on our trip was the bike ride, we went on, from one side of the pier to the other side. A young man with a 2 seat cart drove us to the area where the food and entertainment were, and gave us his phone number to text when we were ready to return back to our vehicle. It was a fun, and exciting to catch a view, of beach without the pain of walking miles across and walking back, since I am not big on walking too much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/118lizc
50,Great day out!,We used uber ($30) from Hollywood to spend a day at Santa Monica pier and it was one of the best days during our visit. Weather was perfect and the atmosphere was great. Also a great spot for fishing. We enjoyed the rides at pacific park (had a coupon for 20% off unlimited rides which was a bonus) and walked to Santa Monica Place (shopping centre) for lunch. There were plenty of food options at the pier too. Would definitely recommended to others headed to LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Samarrr
40,Nice views and great photo ops!,"The pier is a pretty standard tourist attraction, from what I could see. You can grab a burger and ice cream, buy some lame souvenirs (tacky tshirts or California state license plate magnets with your name on it), and ride some carnival rides. We didn't do any of those things though. We simply walked out to the end of the pier and back and enjoyed people-watching and the views of the waterfront. The ferris wheel does make for some great photos. I also loved seeing the Route 66 sign. I'm from Chicago and have seen the starting point of Route 66 and now the ending point at Santa Monica Pier. If only I could find the time to drive the whole way! :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/392heathers

50,Great place!,My family stayed at The Viceroy hotel just a few blocks away. We strolled the promenade nightly for restaurants and shopping but always ended up at the Pier. The sunsets are amazing to watch whether you are atop the Farris Wheel or dining at the Lobster restaurant! There are endless activities including an indoor arcade and amusement park rides. This place is great for a first date or a family night out!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stayinntheknow
30,can find nice magnets and a decent place to eat,"you're better of going along ocean drive or santa monica strip to find a nice place to eat, the pier is just like your typical fun fair with popcorn stands and hot dog sellers - overall it was very crowded in march so i can't imagine it in winter but it's a lovely idea as it gives you something to do once done at the beach. AKA people painting your picture, nice souvenirs and a quick place to eat if you're into fast food or the whole day at the beach/fair experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deoblack

30,Strolling Solo,"I cruised down to the Santa Monica Pier early one morning before everything was open. I noticed a restaurant at the end of the pier, a Mexican joint, it looked like a place to eat while waiting on my husband to finish business meeting that evening. I had high Hopes of a fun pleasant time while he was busy. The walk to the pier was pleasant. The actual pier and surrounding at the evening time was vary carnival like. I didn't feel comfortable solo and the Mexican place I thought would be great was ran poorly. Such a waste at that location. I sat at the bar for 5 min and no one acknowledge me. I was thankful after the observations while I waited. I was not in my element. I like clean bars/restaurants that are ran in a higher standard. I left and walked across the bridge to Del Frisco's. Like I mentioned it was a pretty walk to the pier with the Farris wheel lit and the roller coaster ect. Just getting there came the realization of a low class carnival.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toniw9669
30,Over-hyped atraction,"I have never been to the Santa Monica Pier before, so we went to check it out and check it off the bucket list.I was a nice walk to the end and back, but there's not a whole lot to do there. There are some food concessions and a Bubba Gump restaurant, and a number of amusement games and rides. There were a number of buskers performing - the violinist was really good, while the old man was singing his own songs. As you get closer to the end of the pier, you'll see a number of people fishing.The S.M. Pier might be better for families with younger kids to enjoy the amusement area.

50,Walk from Venice,"Great exercise nth walking and biking to the Santa Monica pier. Food Vendors only take cash. Nice trapeze set up with catch option available - fun! Pipes still there, great steps at the end of the pier to sit and watch the waves or throw your fishing line off the end of the pier. Fun for families, reunions, cousins, dates",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/959gailc
40,Santa Monica pier,"A must see place for tourists when visiting Santa Monica! I loved my visit to Santa Monica pier. It was great to walk along the pier and take in a very different view to what I'm used to. The rides were a bit more terrifying than I thought they would be, but then I'm not used to rides! The pier also has an interesting history that I was previously unaware of, going back to 1909. There are also lots of places to buy all the usual touristy things, arcades and plenty of places to eat. Not to mention the beach is right there! It was a nice experience for a couple who just met.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelcookie23
40,Touristy but a must see,"Stopped by on way home when most shops were closing but was worth to see even in the dark, especially since someone was feeding a sea lion and we dont often see one",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dolphan39
50,A Los Angeles must,"A visit to see the end of Route 66 is a must for any visitor to LA, a walk up the pier and along the beach to Venice is a nice way to pass a few hours. Lots to do on the pier as well a fair, arcades, shops, takeaways and restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wrongjon
40,Fun times for a lone traveller,"Came here nearly everyday during the week I stayed. Always something new to see or do. Buskers, market stalls, food and drink, the beach. What more could a girl want?Travelled from Melbourne Australia and it felt a bit like home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/802donnam
50,I do love a pier,"A highlight of my LA trip and well worth a visit. Play a tacky arcade game, grab a Coke and watch the sunset. There is something for everyone and well worth a visit- especially at sunset",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JS5071
30,Upperclass Blackpool,"It's tacky, touristy, full of tat and terrible food. Worth a walk to the end to spot the surf.Theme park looks alright. Definitely a place to get your fridge magnets and Route 66 garbage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jambri01
50,Family outing,The pier is fantastic but the crowds are huge and aggressive. Parking is a crazy nightmare. Once you've parked the activity is great. Lots of fun for families but you MUST keep little ones close. It's just that busy. We were lucky to see an amazing sunset. I'd suggest you go but be ready for a crazy crowd.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FlowerLover117
40,Very touristy but worth a visit,"Santa Monica Pier is another one of those obligatory sites you have to check out while you're in LA. It's a great scene with beautiful views, but incredibly touristy. Everything is kind of expensive and samey, but I'd recommend a short visit if you're a tourist in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WoozyBanker
40,A Landmark!,"How can you visit Santa Monica and NOT go for a walk on the pier. Sure, it's crowded and busy, but it offers one of the best views of the bay, beach and mountains. Definitely worth it to walk all the way out to the very end for some spectacular views! I think the best time of day is around sunset, but there really isn't a bad time to go.We did not eat, drink or buy anything, but there are plenty of places to spend your money if that's what you're into. We mostly enjoyed it for the people watching and the great photo opps!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandBAtlanta
40,Good place to enjoy the water!,Having heard and seen this site in so many television shows and movies we had to go see it for ourselves. It is a great place to either stroll the pier or if you want to go in the ocean the public beach is right next to it. Great views of Malibu and Venice Beach on both sides of the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Texhusky75
50,Recommend watching the Sunset!,Make time - to visit Santa Monica! (my favorite place)Watched the sunset on my first night on the Santa Monica Pier.Took a bus from West Hollywood (about 45 mins.),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Peterfrt66sea

50,Sunny & Breezy Weather Amazing,Hands down this was a special treat for the day during our tour of Hollywood will definitely visit again. Traffic wasn't too bad coming into the area in the boardwalk it was a lot of shops to buy nice souvenirs and keep sake items for memories there were people painting and drawing and just all kinds of stuff. The ice creamand funnel cakes are amazing definitely a place you should visit once in your life!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/greendoc25
40,"Lovely Pier, but very busy","Lovely Pier, and loved watching the friendly seal at the end of the pier who clearly is used to the public ! Very busy I assume because of television publicity, but definitely worth a visit. Beautiful to watch the sunset here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yvonnesL3466UJ
50,Bucket list item.,"Check off my list: Ride the ferris wheel at the Santa Monica Pier overlooking the Pacific as the sun sets. Other than the awkward walk thru the smelly homeless park to get to the pier, this was an experience I will never forget. The rides, the food, the people, the views...all come together perfectly at sunset. There is city parking only a few blocks from the pier and better than average bathroom facilities. We also caught a tour leaving from the pier and saw dolphins in the water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GwenParmer
50,Great atmosphere,"Yeah it's a bit tacky and yeah it's very touristy, but I really loved Santa Monica pier, unfortunately we just missed the last ride on the big wheel (which closed strangely early for summer at 5pm) but we had great fun in the arcade and watching the buskers at the end of the pier. The whole place just had a really nice chilled out atmosphere that reminded me of UK seaside holidays as a kid.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/380matm

30,It is what it is,"We kind of always expect more from these kind of experiences and places. This one is more about history than anything special today. Nothing is about quality yet somehow you want to see it and be part of it for a short time.Yes it is cheesy, run down and has a bit of a strange feeling to it yet at the end it ends up meaning something to you.It is really part of the California history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharingIsCaring2013

Views are wonderful at the end of the Pier and there are plenty of places to eat, whether you choose healthy or junk!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Justmijas
40,Popular Weekend Attraction,"Great view of the ocean with carnival type atmosphere. A couple of restaurants on the pier premise and plenty of food stands for funnel cakes, churros and ice cream. We went Saturday evening around 6:30 pm and it was very crowded. Pier parking was full but if you look carefully there is convenient inexpensive parking on 2nd and Broadway. Traffic is terrible but manageable. Several rides but long lines. I would not recommend for very small children - too congested.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngShue

50,Perfection in every way!,"What's there not to like? Santa Monica Pier has to be one of the highlights of my PCH trips because it's what I have expected from SoCal: Beautiful, relaxing, and festive! Lined with so many shops and restaurants of various kinds and price ranges plus a mini amusement park, you can be here for any reason to eat, shop, or simply stroll. Santa Monica is already a beautiful city, but I think this pier alone is definitely what made me love Santa Monica as one of my favorite cities in the world!Whether you are on a PCH trip or a LA getaway, you cannot miss this famous pier!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jayyen93

40,Nice atmosphere,Went one evening. Lovely place to visit. The big wheel has mesmerising lights on and the whole ambience of the boardwalk is lovely. There's touristy things to buy but also you can just walk along the pier and enjoy sights and sounds,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CRGrove
50,Fun!,"We had so much fun on the boulevard! We road the ferris wheel and my daughter road the rollar coaster. We took pictures and walked around. It was fun to people watch. There are games and rides for everyone, including little kids. The beach is right there so you can walk or sit on the beach. There are plenty of places to get food and there is an aquarium. It is worth the trip! Parking was not a problem for us, although we did go on a cloudy day. It looks like there is plenty of parking. You need to pay a small amount to park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ASLOV
40,Don’t Miss to Take a photo of the End of the Route Sign.,"The 106-year-old Santa Monica Pier with the Pacific Park, a family amusement park with Ferris wheel, is reasonably popular with visitors. You can also find all kind of seafood restaurants, cafés, shops along the pier and Ocean Avenue. Beaches populated with surfers and sun-tanning lovers come here to spend a day and neighborhood. Santa Monica Pier is the location of the end of legendary Route 66. Don’t forget to take a photo of the End of the Route sign. Route 66, which ends its 4,023 km (2,500 mi) journey a few blocks away at Olympic and Lincoln Boulevards.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jameshuang

40,Mother Daughters trip,"We visited here as part of our SoCal stops. It was chilly to start the day but cleared up. The pier us very busy and a typical ""tourist trap."" It's famous, so we went. It has a lot of little souvenir shops, arcade, etc...the boardwalk along the beach was nice. Unfortunately, we were there during a marathon and leaving was a nightmare driving!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LISaaah_13

Can easily spend a day here, take your time and walk for miles down the boardwalk to take it all in. Lots of fun snack type foods, go ahead and indulge!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngLanePhil
40,Visit Bubba Gump,Super friendly staff at this store! The pier is pretty boring after 8pm as everything is closed but the arcade is fun it's just pretty expensive about $1 a game. The churros are good but it's cold at night I highly recommend going during the day there's also very cheap parking $2 an hour by the pier and there's a heavy police presence so it's very safe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sportygirl1772
40,Beautiful,I had time to kill after a cancelled flight so jumped on the flyaway bus from LAX to Santa Monica. The bus stops right outside a shopping centre with lots of known name shops including Tiffany. I walked from the mall to the pier along the beach and its stunning. It is a little sad also due to the large amount of homeless people around the area. The pier itself is great with amusement rides etc.The beach is spotless and I highly recommended if you are in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stagmouth
40,Lovely place for a stroll,Great place for souvenirs and even has a cute little theme park. The best time to go would be around 5pm to catch the sunset as it's simply stunning. The typical Cali scenes with the seagulls and orange sunset.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marissapereira
10,Not a place to go king crab not open properly,Bad review all the way. Not much in deserts. Hair in the bread even though reply was that they got them from outside but v r having it at their Resturant so I don't care where they r coming from.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/136imrana
50,Such a beautiful place !!! Don't miss a tour or visit,I really didn't know what to expect as I have always seen it on television but thought it was too good to be true but oh my gosh it was so amazing. Unfortunately we were on a tour so we only got an hour we did the Ferris wheel which goes around so many time they were very generous and the views were spectacular. We didn't get to go to the end of the pier as weWe're short on time but the run up the bridge for the pics and back down for the sights of the beach on each side was breath taking. Honestly don't miss this if you can go make sure Santa Monica is a definite a stop over.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maleya
40,Peaceful place amidst the crowds,Took my teenage niece here for her first view of the Pacific. Gorgeous day. Fun people and relaxing time in beach.Despite the crowds there is real peace here.Also took a walk to Third Street Promenade for food and shopping. Nice day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pjhahn
40,Nice little stroll,"The pier was like many piers I've seen...with the exception of an amusement park! Aside from the rides, lots of shops, street vendors, solo music acts with an open guitar cases and tourist trap restaurants. Can't deny the beautiful view of the ocean, beach and seaside...pretty incredible. I'd recommend anyone going here to watch the sunset. Glad to have said I've been here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lagerhead814
40,Loved being at the end of route 66,"The pier has something for everyone, it is really family friendly and I was shocked at the public toilets...immaculate, so clean, tidy and smelt nice too.

40,Sunny Day Fun,"My husband and I devoted an entire day to Santa Monica and the Pier. We arrived early, before many of the other tourists had arrived. The Pier is probably the best at this time of the day. Not to hot, not too busy.There is a lot to see and do. Shopping, food, sand and surf. The crowd can be a little overwhelming at times, but that seems to be LA in general. There was also a creepy looking Minnie Mouse mascot hanging around which freaked me out.Would recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/200ashleys
30,Great sight,The pier was nice but very busy. I also felt like it was dirty around the pier I liked mission beach pier in San Diego better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlbertaWanderer
30,Typical pier attraction,"Expect the regular beggars, barkers, and buskers. Nothing to aggressive but still somewhat off-putting if you're not used to it.Parking is $6 at the pier for all day but no in and out privileges. This is a good deal if you want a quick in and out. Across the street it is as much as $15 but can get cheaper further inland. The pier is rough for small wheeled strollers but doable. You can walk all the way out to the end for free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Care13bear
40,"A must visit, just because it's there!","Visited my son who lives in Irvine so we made the trip to Santa Monica Pier. I'm glad we did. Such a lovely old pier with a carnival atmosphere of old. The smell of the ocean, the kids running around having fun, the seagulls and oh, the seals up close and personal! We sat on the pier and watched the cutest seals just hanging out and being friendly while the fishermen caught them lunch. It was lovely! Watched the sun setting over the water, grabbed an ice cream and just relaxed .A must go to when in Southern Cali.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KenmareLisa
40,LA/Hollywood,Great time on the pier with two early teens. They loved the rides and snacks and all the action. Wish there was better options for renting chairs and umbrellas for the beach once you are tired of the pier attractions,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SKE95
50,Drinks very good at Mariasol,We walked the pier and stopped in at the bar for drinks. I asked the bartender to make me a Bloody Mary but not to make it so spicy. It was perfect. We had chips and salsa with our drinks. Not very expensive for a touristy place. Next time will stay to eat. Looks like a nice Mexican restaurant serving freshly made guacamole table side.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chikitaaa
50,Classic Santa Monica,"You can't visit Santa Monica without a visit to the pier. There is parking right on the pier (a little pricey) and lots to see and do. Old fashioned arcades, street performers and great carnival like food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LizC1509

40,Monica pier,Nice view of beach and surrounding area. Older wooden structure but seems sold. Looks like fun rides and arcade for the kids. Feels a little scary later at night without activities or lights,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanP175
50,"Nice Pier to eat,drink & shop","We rented a car for the day and drove down from L.A. It was a nice day so we parked the car in the large lot and walked up and down the pier. We stopped and grabbed some lunch and people watched. Quick little walk after lunch and we were off. There were many pier performers set up playing lots of music and vendors selling nick nacks up and down, as well as lots of people tanning,playing volleyball on the beach,and fishing from the pier. Nice little get away from the hustle of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bnjb33
40,Great walk but avoid during weekends,"The Pier is a very entertaining place and hence can get very crowded during the weekends.We enjoyed our walk on the pier thanks to the different entertainers (singers/musicians), little shops, great view of the beach/ocean, restaurants.For a first time in Santa Monica, I'll definitely recommend it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/princessvania
40,Iconic California landmark,"Santa Monica Pier combines amusement rides, food stands and restaurants, souvenir shops, street musicians, fishing areas, and the terminus of historic Route 66. The attraction we liked best was the classic merry go round beautifully restored in its historic building complete with an old fashioned soda fountain. You can ride for the antique price of only $2. We also rode the Pacific Wheel, more of a viewing platform than a true Ferris wheel as it turns so slowly ($8). People-, bird-, and wave-watching add to the fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MerrillC_12
50,I love Santa Monica,"I love Santa Monica and it's Pier! It's such a great place! Lots of people from all over the world, and so cozy! Love the beach around it! And the Pier has a few nice shops!

40,Well laid out,The rides kept my kid well amused. They are well laid out taking up every possible inch of usable space and still permitting easy access.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tudela1130
40,Stunning view...,It's Sunday afternoon and we decided to go for a walk at the Pier. The little amusement park is really great. I enjoy the peaceful sound of the waves. It's nice to walk barefoot on the sand watching the sunset. A little downside is it's too crowded and it's hard to look for a parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suzette1223
40,"literally watch the sun set. Beware of ""public parking"" by Sears, cheaper spots closer in.","The sun sets very quickly, and you can actually see it go down!. Definitely a highlight of our trip. Beware of the shady parking in the Sears parking lot, it's $15 dollars, while the esplande is a dollar an hour and is just down the block.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johndoe13
10,Way way to busy on weekend,"Visited Santa Monica pier on the weekend . That was a huge mistake if you don't like massive crowds , bumper to bumper traffic etc. Had to pay $20 to park at the Sears three blocks away , took me over 30mins to get to the pier once off hiway and it's only 10 blocks away , it is just chaotic. Not sure what it's like on weekdays that may have been a better option for me. Definitely would never go back on a weekend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShaneM_12

A must-see if you're in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/balhui
40,Relaxing,"The Santa Monica pier is an icon of the LA area. That is not to suggest I would put it first in my list of things to see and do, but it would make the top 10ish list. There are places to eat, some better than others and some not worth your time at all so be sure to check out reviews before ordering a meal. It is a relaxing way to spend a few hours enjoying the coast and people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tkwitt
50,Excellent,Such a great place to visit. So much going on. Definitely worth a stroll down the pier and the coastal views are spectacular.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adammawright
30,Best for families - not so much for solo travellers,Santa Monica Pier has a festive atmosphere and some very good food but would be most enjoyable with family or friends instead of solo. Plenty of activities on the beach and be sure to rent a bike from the Pier to ride to Venice,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FranzA848
50,Great for Tourists!,When we come here we stay just across the road at the Windham and love coming across here in the late arvo to have a stroll past the shops and stalls.

50,A must go experience!,This is an iconic piece of history built around 1910. It's free and houses a fun fair and loads of eateries and ice cream parlours etc etc. You can even park your car here and they have their own Police Station! This is the final stop of the famous Route 66! They are currently doing some engineering work there but you must visit and be able to tell your friends your were there! Remember to take photos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheFlyingFrock

40,Stuff to see and a nice walk,"As piers go, the Santa Monica pier is probably rather ordinary. Theres an amusement park section, a few restaurants, a variety of carts pushing souvenirs and stuff and perhaps the best thing of them all, a spectacular view of the bay.

40,Fun diversion,"This was our second time visiting Santa Monica. It's one of my favorite areas in California. The Santa Monica Pier has a fun carnival feel. There are various rides including a feriswheel and coaster. Various musicians perform on the boardwalk and artists create caricatures and other works of art. The end of the pier has a restaurant and many fishermen (although the health dept discourages anyone from eating fish caught in that water). The Santa Monica Pier is lauded as being the end of Route 66. There's great people watching on the pier. We were there the day of the LA Marathon (which ended at the beginning of the pier), so it was an interesting mix of tired runners, families, and foreign tourists.The bike path (south to Venice Beach and north to Pacific Palasades) runs underneath the pier and there is a large parking lot on the north side.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mojo_Sailor
50,Wonderfully fun afternoon!,"My friends and I spent the afternoon at Santa Monica Pier after a super stressful week working in LA, and we had such an amazing time! It lived up to all our expectations from movies and tv shows. It was a sunny day, the water was this gorgeous shade of blue, we could see surfers on all sides of us, and even spotted two seals at the end of the pier! We only rode the carrousel, but it gave us such a perfect view of the pier and memories we will never forget. It was so cool walking up and down the pier and people-watching. There were tons of places to eat, and get crappy coffee, and lots of cute little gift shops. We also used the photo booth and surprisingly got such a nice set of photos, I highly recommend!Santa Monica is definitely worth the trip!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C5057LTnicolaf

50,Everything A Pier Should Be,"Returning to Santa Monica after several years, we made sure to revisit the Pier. It is everything a good Pier should be, over the sea, noisy, colourful and full of happy people. Food outlets in variety, musicians, fun fairs and well supplied with seating. We spent hours enjoying the ambience and the general feeling of goodwill created by visitors making the most of the day. Go if you have never been, and go back again if you have.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bsandrs
50,Best Pier!,"Without a doubt this is the best pier on the west coast complete with amusement park, trapese academy, indoor carousel, various lower level fishing piers, restaurants, shopping, and views of the beaches. Parking is available for the day or by the hour. You can also walk to it from Santa Monica if you decide to visit the sights there, e.g. Third Street Promenade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LUCKYME72
50,A must visit for first timers,There's so much to do at the pier. You can just people watch or enjoy the food and activities. Pacific Park is fun for the kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foblex
40,"Touristy, but a must see while there.","Fun visit, nothing terribly unique about it but definitely worth seeing. Can get crowded and the walkway over the bridge is narrow, but again, a fun way to spend an hour or two.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/db2011
40,I had an amazing hotdog!!!,"I went to the pier that was of course full of people.. However, I didn't feel crowded or overwhelmed. We walked up and down the pier people watching, looking at the waves and taking in the ocean breeze.. I had an amazing guacamole and onion hot dog from this stand. (please forgive me I don't remember the name.. I'm sure they are there everyday). But beware of the seagulls!!! One swooped right down stole my friends hot dog right out her hand.. lol.. Please visit and there are also some great shops in that area too..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/255meghanm
30,Nice Old Pier but needs some TLC,Only a few shops. Interesting acrobat school to watch and the fishermen at the end of the pier are nice. A few rides and restaurants. But everything looks a little too run down. Beautiful ocean to watch though!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ItsUsInLux2011
50,A pier like no other. ..,Santa Monica pier is such a great experience. From the carousel to the restaurants overlooking the water...there is something for everyone and you won't want to leave.

Cause you surely gonna see a lotOf them.Nice colourful pier at night, quite chill during December (which is good reason to hug your better half)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shiko_m
40,Cool place,"Was a nice place to walk along. It's a beautiful place to see the ocean. Though it was very overpriced. We were after a coffee and was almost double the price, so we ended up going elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebeccarH9114OH
50,Beautiful,"We had a great time on the pier and determined we will stay in the area when we return. There is a lot to do for kids, but as an adult couple we had fun too. We enjoyed the musicians at the end of the pier while watching the sun set.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrystalAnn56
10,Under-whelming,"There is literally nothing about this pier that makes it stand out in any way. There is nothing charming, no decent places to eat, the fair-ground is rubbish and it's packed. The only redeeming feature was that the parking was not as expensive as I expected (I think it was $6).There are tons of tourists milling about taking pictures (of what?) and anything there was too expensive.I can't believe all of the glowing reviews for this entirely below average place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshleyZB1
50,Worth an evening visit.,We were amazed at the number of cars parked on the beach and wondered where everyone had gone. We found out. The pier!Having just eaten it was a relaxing end to the day. Interesting and entertaining.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sweeperman

50,Love this place...,"I loved the Santa Monica Pier. It was one of the best things about my visit to Los Angeles. There is so much to see and do on the pier. There are performers and music and there's a little amusement park, akin to Coney Island, but on a smaller scale. Great fun. Definitely give it a visit, get some sun, sea and fun all in one spot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shacheb75
30,Busy Busy place!!,"We were there over a Saturday, right after New years ... so many people it felt as we were just being pushed along in a mass. A must-see place but not somewhere we will go again during peak holiday time. My mom (she is 5'2"") felt intimidated with so much activity around her - didn't find it relaxing or enjoyable. Bad on us for going at the wrong time. Good for people watching though!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buzz101
20,Too crowded. Too expensive. And nothing special.,"Have you ever been to a county fair or crappy amusement park? Then you've been to the Santa Monica Pier. Do you love waiting in line for 20 mins to go on a Ferris Wheel? Then this is the place for you. If you're idea of a good meal is Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, then hooray for the pier.The beach is beautiful. But I'll be skipping the pier next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dcalibanh
50,Great classic puer,Took a pier walk on a picture perfect day. Cool and breezy. Lots of fun activities. Be sure to Ride the historic merry go round! Or just sit and enjoy the people watching.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JonCUBuff
50,The fun on the beach,Santa Monia pier is a place you must visit. Although don't go thinking its alive with action in Jan as its winter so its slow and most was shut down. I have been in summer and the place was alive and vibrant and was electric with rides food atmosphere.You must go if you are in the area if you don't you will miss something unique and wonderful. It really has a life of its own and having been there when its going great to quiet its seemed sad in a way as you knew what it can be is like and i so wanted to show others my experiences and it wasn't the same.But go see it the colours sound and music are brilliant.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glennb164
30,Typical tourist thing to do,"Came here last night. Walked the pier and played some games. Not a lot to do on the,pier unless you want to take a nice stroll. There are a few rides and carnival,games as well as some restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nailcutter
50,GREAT ADVENTURES...,I was so glad to be able to ride the antique merry-go-round. The last time I was on this pier was 40 years ago & it was closed but I could see the stilled pretty painted horses beckoning to me inside the long time locked up building. I remember feeling sad at the time...But not this time!!! I rode six times on the pretty antique merry-go-round and got off 'swimmy headed'... lol..then for a nice walk to the end of the pier . I'm glad the Santa Monica Pier was brought back to life...it made me happy...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzanneg271
20,Nothing special,"The famous pier needs some work. Its basicly a bunch of souvenir shops, artists and jesus enthousiasts all trying to get your attention. The ferris wheel is fun and the view at the end of the peer is nice, but skip the rest and have your food elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nelis010
20,Underwhelming,"I was expecting more from this pier. I was disappointed. It was run down and somewhat boring. The view from the pier was awesome, however.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/boosa3mu

40,Photogenic beach area,Nice beach area that's really photogenic. It's a bit touristy but still fun. There's a merry go around for the kids. A Ferris wheel and other rides for kids or young at heart. A few stores selling souvenirs and such. We brought a hot dog from Japadog and a coffee to warm us up at the coffee and tea leaf. Love how this place lights up at night. Can be quite romantic to stroll here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Avrilx
40,Santa Monica Pier,"No trip to Santa Monica is complete without visiting the Pier. Its not to everyone's taste but its worth a look. Either ride the iconic roller coaster, play in the arcades or walk to the end of the Pier and watch people fishing or watch the sun set or rise. It just gives off a great vibe especially on a summers night!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/snsimmy23
40,An enjoyable evening doing not much of anything,The Santa Monica Pier and nearby third street promenade create an enjoyable evening of simply wandering. I can't see there is much point to it - we aren't big 'carny' folks and so the rides and games are lost on us. But the beautiful weather and people watching turns it into a nice walk. The end of the pier gives you some great views of the shore and there always seem to be street performers on the pier and the promenade. And there are lots of restaurants on third street to satisfy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/802KenT
50,Classic tourist area… worth the visit,Fun place to experience. A west coast Coney Island.Beach access from the pier. Easily accessible washrooms.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YVR_Traveller_9

We saw lots of great birds and made friends with a seal one evening when we watched the sun set at the lower fishing dock.There are rides, shops, restaurants and street (pier) entertainers.

50,Fab pier and really kitch,A walk along the spare is a must for anybody visiting Santa MonicaIt is really naff with all sorts of rubbish she stands in shops located upon it but this all adds to its uniquenessIt's a very lively place and well worth a walk to the very end where you will find the fishermen in abundance,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Teesdalepark
10,Left us uneasy,I guess I had bigger expectations. I was very disappointed and nervous on the pier. Not what I thought it would be. I will never go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xpro13

40,A Little Amusement Park on the Pier in the Ocean,"We had never been to Santa Monica before and so we were delighted that our hotel was within walking distance of the pier. There is an entrance to the beach to the right of the pier with a place to wash sand off your feet for when you are leaving the beach. There is a Mexican restaurant at the end of the pier which is good for lunch as the view of the ocean is better during the day. They have a small roller coaster and Ferris wheel with some other rides and games. There are stores, restaurants, street vendors and street musicians everywhere on the pier. It is a long pier and a good walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mouse1999
30,What you expect - geared toward kids,"The pier is fairly crowded but in the morning it is quieter and a lovely walk. It has the end of Route 66, which is cool, and has the usual carnival style food and a Ferris wheel, but almost everything is geared toward kids under 13. Definitely for families rather than friends. Oh and don't go on the Ferris wheel at sunset - the sun sets into the Ferris wheel so you are basically blind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurensP4779BM

30,Nice.,"Well I've seen this pier dozens of times in movies, tv series , videogames, my first feeling was that it was smaller than I thought, I was walking along the pier until the end, the view from there was nice, Muscle beach and Venice beach, and front of you the Pacific Ocean,then I walked toward to the amusement park, I was surprised that the attractions were not cheap. Finally I was eating at Bubba Gump Restaurant, nice views and nice food. Well, it's a nice place but honestly I expect something more, it's wrong to idealize a place before visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J8131APjoseantoniom
50,Beautiful end of a LA tour,"We went there as part of day tour and it was great. The sunset, the ambience, everything was excellent.

The street entertainment around there is always so entertaining and enjoyable.The views are spectacular. Especialy if you take a ride on the big wheel. It's so amazing at night time. Breath-taking views.The best part by far and a memory that will never leave me is watching the sunset from the beach - such a warming glow covering the entire area.

This was the first time any of us had touched the Pacific Ocean; it's a beautiful sight! We even saw a couple pelicans just hanging out on the railings.

30,Best admired from the distance away from the crowds,"Having just driven the Route 66 we felt obliged to spend some time on the pier and, of course, have our photo taken under the ""end"" sign; that is, once you've battled past the hordes of tourists. Crowds of tourists aren't really our thing, so this put us off spending too much time here. If you love GTA5 then another bonus is checking out the pier for its gameplay similarities. It was really fun, like stepping into the game. Mostly, this pier is best admired from the distance in the evening. Take a lovely walk down the beach, away from the crowds, and enjoy the beautiful lights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KateP968

50,The Sun Worshippers Delight - Santa Monica Pier.,"The 106 year old Santa Monica Pier on Ocean Avenue in Los Angeles is a tourists delight. The wharf out onto the bay on Pacific Park has just about everything - amusement parks, rides - the Santa Monica Looff Hippodrome (carousel) is a historic landmark. You get a splendid view from the top of the world’s only solar powered 130-foot ferris wheel. There are games, excellent sea food, fun stalls with all kinds of souvenirs – T-shirts, guide books, entertainment – we saw a fat albino snake slithering around a person’s neck, and ofcourse, the gorgeous fiery sunsets. Just below the carousel is the aquarium - home to more than 100 species of marine animals and plants. You can even learn to fly! The legendary Route 66 ends it 2,500 mile journey which cuts across the U.S. a few blocks away at Lincoln and Olympic boulevards - take a picture at the End of the Route sign on the Pier. You can spend an entire day on its endless beach with tanned bodies of muscular body builders, sun worshippers and surfers. There are wooden walk-aways along the beach that take you right to the water. The Santa Monica Pier is well connected by road – the Big Blue Bus and rail – so have fun in the sun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/812jp

40,A must do especially on a sunny day,"The family and I stopped at the Pier mid morning and thoroughly enjoyed it. The view itself of the pier as you walk from the street down is really cool. Then as you make you way down onto the old wooden pier you will find a heap of things to see, from people busking too a few different places to eat and drink.It is a must do on a sunny day as the beach and coastline looks great from out on the pier. Its awesome to stand out on the pier and see the waves roll under and the surfers trying to catch a few. There are a heap of great places to take some really good photos of both the pier and coastline.The rides are a bit pricey but other than that it was well worth the stop. Whilst we parked a block back in a public car-park the parking along the beach was reasonable cheap as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattmboom
50,Beautiful........Plenty to do.,"There is so much to do. You have one of the most beautiful beaches, food outlets, walking trails, Route 66 sign, fishing, relaxing, shopping, amusement park and much much more. We had so much fun here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GSTAA5
30,"Haha, Okay","This pier is kinda lame in of itself. But if you're into campy stuff, I do recommend it. Has a mildly creepy aura, which is the best thing about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KamranNezami
40,Nice view,Nice place to see the ocean and the beach where baywatch was filmed. Street musicians adding a bitter sweet flavour to the pier which kakes it very special,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/398muhammedb
50,Christmas Day at the beach,The pier was everything we thought it would be charming and classic. live music on the end of the pier on Christmas Day was just fabulous,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Worry911
40,Pretty cool,"Lots of fun and entertainment. The amusement park is fun and cute. The views of the end of the pier are beautiful. Sunset and evening are by far the best times, the food stalls open up and the place comes alive.There are street performers are,, interesting. Some are good others should not be there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spookikiwi
50,Great fun!,"We visited the puer on our trip from Australia and thought it was wonderful! The atmosphere and variety of thibgs to look at and do was amazing. The beach is also lovely, a must see when visiting LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/612ashleyh
50,Beautiful beach day,This was the best place we visited in Los Angeles. Lots of public parking a block from pier. Enjoyed the shops on the pier. Beautiful views of Pacific Palisades mountains. Also nice walk from pier to Venice beach. I suggest to rent a bike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/494williamr
50,Walk this place,Make sure to come with walking shoes and be ready to walk. This pier is best experienced on foot. Watch the people; enjoy the water.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LV_Lee
50,Fun walk and rides,My hubby and I went to Santa Monica pier we walked along the beach and everything else was fun! We also rode the Ferris wheel and it has a beautiful view of the entire beach and the pier I recommend this beach to family's specially because they have a mini adventure park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cvh3
50,Merry go around,"Being a Santa Monican I hope I can give people an insight what this pier really stand for. Its fun and exhilarating and youthful. This pier has been here for all children since I can remember, it's the summer destination of all Angelenos. You would see picnics all over the surrounding park, children enjoying the arcade games and Ferris wheel,Which I might add was recently replaced. Its the Westside version of east coast Coney island.The adults have their choices of restaurant, and if you're a healthnut, running along a beach should be a treat. The Pacific ocean does have its beauty... After all who could resist that?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/355charitoa
50,A Must See!,"A must see in LA, parking can be tricky (go early) and many cool dining spots for lunch either on or off the pier. A good morning walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoadSage1
30,Iconic place to visit in LA and you must stay for sunset!!!!,If you visit Santa Monica parking at the pier is EASY and cheap at $8 for a whole day. The pier itself has some food and coffee places (fairground food don't expect amazing choices)It's a fun place to visit. If you park here I would recommend hiring a bike HERE and then riding down from this point down to the main Santa Monica centre. The bikes at this end are much cheaper than anywhere else (having walked past a load of of much more expensive hire places)Food choices here are not so good.... But the experience is 'funfair'. Only fun when it's sunny.....and leaving the car park after the sunset has gone is a bit slow so be patient!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G2654PSddj
50,Special place,"Beautiful place, specially at the sunrise and sunset moments. The seagulls are the attraction, besides the park and the view. If you are in Santa Monica you have to go there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deborahd582
50,So much fun,We love the Santa Monica Pier and all of the surrounding area. This is such a fun place to go. We love to walk on the boardwalk and this time there was a great violin player which we watched and in the back ground watched the sun set. Doesn't get any better than that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happyandretired318
40,Love the churros,Very happy. Wish my hotel was in this area. Good for families. Tons of food and shopping. The rides were pretty fun too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/938kimberlya
40,Interesting collection of stuff and people,"While on our trip up the coast to eventually get to the Getty, we stopped off at the pier (or son had been there the day before with the marching band). We didn't have long to stay and despite it being December in California, it was colder than the locals would have liked, and it actually lightly rained for a moment. Many of the street performers and artists on the pier were kinda cool to experience. Now I can say I've been to the end of Route 66.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D1938JLchrism
50,One of a kind experience!,This area was unlike anything found in the South...truly a one of a kind experience! Out visiting my daughter and we had a blast!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SherryB_12

50,Santa Monica Pier,"This place is nice, really worth the visit. There are some good restaurants there, some place to buy gifts too. You should go there in the sunset, the view is amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jfsg89
40,Fun family destination,"Family and out-of-town friends for a stroll and a snack. Fun crowds, nice picture opportunities and walking distance from the beach (obviously) and the Promenade. Gret free concerts during the summer season (Thursdays?)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/508henric
50,Beautiful Beach & boardwalk!,"I've been to santa Monica a few times and always make it a point to go to the santa monica pier & walk on the board walk. There is a ferris wheel, games, booths with souvenirs, etc. The view from the boardwalk is just beautiful.The beach is clean and it is a short drive to marina del rey & Venice beach!There is a lot of parking nearby in case you dont want to park on the beach (can't remember the price). There are meters you can park at for $2.00 every 3 hrs.Highly recommend this beach for a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ttbarlow11
30,Ok,"We walked down to the pier because, well its Santa Monica Pier. I really wasn't impressed. Didn't seem like much more than a pier with a couple rides, restaurants and souvenir shops.Now the view was stunning so I was glad to walk out there but it was a quick peek and that was it. Everything is super expensive on the pier.Quite a few homeless people around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/244chuckl
50,Beautiful place,"My son loved it. I went during the winter and the rides were closed, but the weather was nice. I rented a bike and rode around the pier with my son, which was nice. The route 66 sign is a must for pictures. I made the mistake of parking away from the pier for $20. As I walked to the pier, there were cheaper parking garages and inside the pier it's free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianamP6140CZ
50,Loved it,"Great place to spend your afternoon. It has nice views, good food and fun. Go all the way to the back. See the muscle beach too ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/451janad
40,Escape from LAX,"5 hour stopover on trip from NZ to Aspen. Nothing much at LAX, so taxied out to Santa Monica pier. Great afternoon in winter sunshine; meal at Bubba Gumps; few ""kids"" games on pier... Didn't try Roller coaster due to kids apathy, but looked pretty cool for the pier! Dipped ankles in water, and took lots of photos! Had thought of going to closer beach for walk, but worked out fine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrMikeNZ
40,Nice excursion for an hour or two,"Lively Boardwalk with interesting people watching, shopping, gamEs, and food. Great views of ocean and beach, if a bit windy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/255jeannej
40,A great get away and fun place,This was close enough to Vegas for a day trip. A great opportunity to visit the Pacific Coast. A fun place to visit/experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brianc180
40,Iconic and good food,"Overall, I had a good time. It's definitely an iconic place to visit in Cali. There is much too see and explore. Many food options; the funnel cakes were the best. We didn't go on any of the rides, but could tell people were enjoying themselves on them. At night, it's even more lively with people playing music and people fishing off the pier. If you're in the area, I would give it a try.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrianVilayvanh
40,Fun place to stop and site see!,"We were traveling down highway 1 and stopped here at Santa Monica pier. Fun place to stop and grab a souvenir for people back home. We enjoyed some ice cream as we walked the pier enjoying the vendors working for tips. Beautiful picture options along the pier and we even took some videos of vendors. Now we can say when we see this setting on a movie, that we have been there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/casscamp
30,An interesting distraction-but not a main attraction,"I remember coming to the Pier as a kid and this visit brought back some memories. Not as grand as I remember, a bit gritty actually. If you want good food, eat at the places near the Pier not on it. Great place for some nice views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElkGroveChris
50,Iconic,Great landmark to check out and do some serious people watching or chill out. Good for family or individuals! Check it our,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brad945
50,End of Route 66,This pier is a lovely place to go for the day. Plenty of places to eat and a fun park on the pier itself. What's more it is the official end of Route 66,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karos1
50,Santa monica pier,A must do if visiting LA. Beautiful beach and a walk along the pier at sunset was breathtaking. Include a wander to the local shopping mall for great prices with loads of variety.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aundreabb
30,Make the most of it going to the machines !,"This place is good. However, I will not give it 5 stars because there is not much to it other than some restaurants, the aquarium and the machines. The machines were fun, we bought the tickets that included all of them (cheaper this way). If you buy them separately, they are about $8 a ride, which is ridiculous. it is a good place to take pictures and walk around the beach. after a few hours there is not much to do. i do recommend this place though. visit everything the pier has to offer and don't just stand there looking at the ocean.their funnel cakes are actually good and BIG. 1 funnel cake is good for 2-3 people.great place to take tons of pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VeronicaTrias
40,Pier and 3rd street promenade,Lots to see and do. Good shopping and eateries. The rides on the pier are small but have a great view. Rides are VERY expensive. So be prepared for $8 rides.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MJArenal
40,Good entertainment for kids,"As grandparents, we take our 5 and 7 year old grand daughters to the Santa Monica Pier occasionally. It is great entertainment for them, and the ride operators really do care about the kids. Recently, our 5 year old grand daughter got onto a ride, and became very frightened. The ride operator saw this, and stopped the ride to allow her to exit. The ride operator then re-started the ride so the others on board could enjoy it. We recommend the SM Pier as good entertainment for families, and the all day pass is a real bargain.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikejuha
50,Beautiful!,"Very beautiful place with lots of things to do, restaurants, shops, cafes and everything else. Parking is also no issue, however be prepared to spend a lot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ggiourtz

50,A must!,"It's one of those things, when in Santa Monica you need to visit the pier! It really is worth a wander, or maybe a burger, or even a ride on the roller coaster. And at night, it looks very special from the beach, all lit up!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wheelfam
40,Holiday,Very well maintainedLots to see and even if it was hazy it was worth seeing itIt is good for young and old and lots of room so you didn't bump into each other,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N2860SUdianes
40,Great spot for families,"The rides on the pier were family based or for younger couples, no high thrill rides. But it was lovely just to walk along the pier checking out the sea gulls and eating some funnel cake.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keets88
40,Must see when in area,The parking right on the pier was very reasonable at $2 an hour. Much better to park on the pier than walk up the ramp. Nice view interesting thing to see on pier. Many performers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillF157
50,Life and buzz of Santa Monica,"Santa Monica Pier is a hive of activity. Famous from so many TV and movie shows, the Pier is the official end of Route 66. Packed with people and fun and games at Pacific Park. At the end of the day, there aren't many better spots in LA to watch the sun set, whilst the fun at the Park kicks on into the night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jdmiller83
30,The county fair suspended over the waves,"An iconic location made famous in movies and television. And you probably need to go there once in your life. If nothing else, to take a photo under that famous neon sign. You may also discover that sometimes things look better on the screen than in real life.Expect lots of tourists, trashy vendors selling souvenirs , carnival rides, and junk food. Exactly like the county fair suspended over the waves. There is a nice view of the beaches all the way up to Malibu from the end of the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoctorM
40,Great half day place,Plenty of parking in the lot right next to the pier and beach. Car parking is a reasonable $8 all day. There are many food places to choose from. Rides look great. A nice place to people watch and see street performers too. Lots of clean restrooms on the pier. I think a half day on the pier is plenty of time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pacundo
50,definitely worth the visit,"I wasn't too fond of Los Angeles, apologies, yet coming out to this side of the area was definitely giving me a clue to why ppl love this area. Relaxing area and nice scene. Not too crowded. I'm not sure where all the parking is , but the main pier had a parking that you have to pay I believe 3 bks every hour. Put this on your to-see list!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mcseven
50,Day trip from LA.,It's always been a dream to drive to Santa Monica then take the coast road to Malibu. Hired a Mustang Convertible and done it. The pier is well maintained and the beach spotless. It's obviously combed every night and the weather was stunning (21 with real feel of 23) so it was quite amusing to see locals in woolley hats and coats. A nice location for the bucket list.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonymc47
40,A great spot for lunch,"We had fish & chips for lunch and walk along the pier. It's a scenic place to visit with nice restaurants. There is quite a few things to do, bike hire & amusement park, but we didn't do them so can't comment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DizzieLizzie19
30,"Overpriced and packed, but nice view","If all you're looking to do is people-watch and take in the view of the beach and ocean, you'll be okay. But if you plan to eat, do the rides, or play games, be prepared to over-charged and disappointed. We were bummed to find that many of the boardwalk games (skeeball, whack-a-mole) were really beaten down and not working correctly any more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jenny_in_Palo_Alto
50,Loved loved,If you plan on making it a day make sure to rent bikes for a couple of hours and ride down to Venice Beach. The ride is about a half hour one way and is amazing :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PerryDanese
50,"""Family Fun At Its Best""","We made several visits to the Santa Monica Pier during 2015...and, without a doubt, the beautiful carousel, located there, became a favorite of our two (almost four-year-old) grandchildren! The carousel is beautifully restored and featured the wonderful music that was meant to go along with it. As I recall, the cost was a reasonable (for California!) three dollars a ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryjos833
40,Strollin' and chillin',"We went just after Christmas, and it was chilly and windy, but sunny. The pier is great for just taking a relaxing walk, seeing all the people and some musical performers, or having one of the several calligraphers create a piece of art out of your name. We enjoyed the ferris wheel views and did a couple of simple easy rides (coaster and rocking ship) with the kids to relive the joy of a few years ago when the kids started on these fun theme park rides (they've since graduated to the super fast thrill rides). The rides were expensive, but surprisingly, the coffee place (Coffee Bean?) was reasonable (I think). As expected, pretty crowded and tough to get parking, but going early on a weekday helped us during the holidays. Just a quick couple of hours having fun doing nothing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/20854Dave_K
50,"Great Places to visit because it's close to Venice Beach, shopping, food and restaurants bike riding and much much more.",I just love the sights sound and smells at the Pier - along with Restaurants Venice Beach and the street stalls that offer all sorts of amazing gifts and souvenirs.Great atmosphere 😀😀😀,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Clawed1
50,Always wanted to go. And didn't disappoint.,"Our visit to SMP on NYE 2016 was great. This place has been on my bucket list (I live in Australia).Lots to see and do, and we have the souvenirs and photos to treasure. We opted not to go on any attractions at Pacific Park, purely because of price (we were heading to Disneyland the next day and that would be enough amusements I think!). Even though it says ""California's only admission-free amusement centre"", it was USD$8PP for the ferris wheel - and for 7 of us in the early evening (read: dark,a bit windy & getting cold) was not justifiable. We ended up having a great wander after some time on the beach, and then enjoyed a delicious dinner at Bubba Gump's.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/superj1978
50,People watch and enjoy yourself!,Such a great place to visit! Plenty of things to do and also plenty of places to sit and do nothing but relax and people watch!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/953carleyb
30,Cheesy,"Very crowded, even on a rainy day. Full of cheap junk and bad food. You may want to stop here if you have never been to Santa Monica before, but dont' make a day of it. If you have kids, they may like it more than adults.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CookGirl-CA
30,"Famous pier, not sure why?","Its got a little theme park on that isn't very good. There are a few cafes on there too but other than that... It's just a pier. It looks really good for a photo but in terms of entertainment, it'll be fun for 5 mins.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darrylgreen
40,End of the road for Route 66,"What an iconic location this is for fans of Route 66 or the Forrest Gump movie. Forrest Gump famously ran to the end of the pier here and turned around and went back across the US. A great location for kids as it has the pier amusement park and a number of novelty type gift shops and eateries. For a lifelong memory, make sure you get a photo underneath the famous Santa Monica Pier sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/warrenw41
40,So much fun on the water,Great arcades to keep the kids entertained indoors to get a little respite from the sun (but I don't know why someone would do that). Great views and enjoyable atmosphere all around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/css1983
50,Awesome place for families!,"We spent 5 hours on the pier and had a great time.Food at bubba gumps was yum, but a little pricey ($US 100 for a family of 2A/3C) we're not big eaters and only had 1 drink no dessert.Rides were great fun $8 for bigger rides and $4 for smaller rides",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rox0881
40,Another Californian Pier,"Just a few minutes driving from there and I was already in Santa Monica’s Pier. People love piers here in the US and I still don’t understand why every single beach has one… I mean, a pier is something nice and useful, people can park small boats, fish, they have restaurants and amusement parks (as they have here in Santa Monica)… But why do they need to build it in every beach? Whatever... Stayed there for a while, enjoying the beach and finally getting into the sea water for the first time! The water here is so much colder than in Panama, but it something I’ve promised to myself I would do! And I did, on the last day and one of the last things on my trip, but the mission was accomplished!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robertopelomundo

50,Amazing,Excellent views from wheel and local artist busking was amazing seeing so many different talents. While family enjoyed the day there,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/libbygirlGoldCoast
40,Nostalgic and entertaining,"By day or by night the Santa Monica Pier never disappoints. The magical lights on the ferris wheel, the rides, the pop-up vendors, and all the different people. Spend a few bucks or just walk around for free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/611joed
40,An Icon Worth The Visit,"We went to the Pier on a weekday. We went about 10:00AM and it was overcast all of which contributed to it not being very crowded. It was a relaxing pleasant visit. The price of food and souvenirs was outrageous, but we expected it to be. There were two musicians playing which added to the atmosphere of the place. We walked from our hotel, but parking looked to be difficult to obtain and expensive. We had a hot dog and garlic fries at the place that suceeded Inkies' Harbor Grill. The hot dog was OK the garlic fries were horrible, too much grease. We fed them to the pidgeons which aggressively encroach on all Pier diners. The place is truly and American icon. Visit the merry-go-round.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShakerRon
40,Fun place to visit,"Great place! Entertainers, funfair, places to eat and drink with fabulous views of the beach. Added bonus of seals as well. Worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/394jow
50,"Fun, lots of action","A have to visit when you are in this area, the walk out to the end of the pier is beautiful. Lots of buskers but no one gave us a hard time. We never got on the rides but they looked fun, great visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Resq28
50,The breezes off the pier was great!,"There is really a lot to see and do on the pier. There is an amusement park (that I did not visit), a few restaurants, vendors, entertainers, fishermen/women, people clamming and a couple gift shops. The gift shops are overpriced (as I would expect), I did not eat at any of the restaurants (however Pier Burger smelled the best) but I did stop and smell the air. I watched the waves crash as the sun went down, I watched sail boats and surfer/body board riders, I watched kids splash and parents laugh. It was a great place to relax, that was until I went back on Friday night . . . it was more like Disney. LOTS of people everywhere; it was difficult to navigate your way to the end of the pier. We did stop and get our picture taken at the end of Route 66, so that was pretty cool. Overall, I strongly suggest that you see this at least once while you are in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wsr0224
40,Fun with kids...,Ordinary pier - which does have some movies credits to it's name. Fun if you have kids.Very crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarbaraS803

30,Crowded And Iconic,"The Santa Monica pier is totally overwhelming and overkill. It seems to attract everybody, period. It should be checked out on a weekday and make sure that you spend more time on the beach than the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RangerNate

40,Cool Stop,This is a great stop for photos. We went early and beat the crowds but we did not get to see the carnival or vendors in full swing. Still we had a good visit. I took a photo with the Zoltan fortune teller machine from the movie BIG. We also bought a kite to fly on one of the many beaches along the Pacific Coast.FYI There is an $8.00 fee for parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thetravelingmx

40,Nice to look at ocean,This was a nice spot to look out on the ocean. I've been on piers with more restaurants and things to do so it wasn't the best pier ever. However the view of the beach is neat and in the back a cool viola player made the mood. Would be a romantic night for date night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lovecruising04

40,All the fun of the fair,SM pier has it all lots to see and do day and night. Wonderful views afforded by the big wheel or try your luck at the stalls on offer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BuddyBrooke
40,Great time at the Pier,Santa Monica Pier is where is action is.... Be it street performances or street shopping or great food this is a one stop shop for all your needs..... We had an amazing time at the pier....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/598rajivc
30,People watching place,"The one thing that stands out about the pier is the fact that this marks the end of Highway 66, which ran from Chicago covering a distance of 3,940km. Apart from that, there's nothing technically spectacular about the pier as it's just a structure that juts out into the Pacific Ocean. However, the city successfully turned the pier into a great public place-making, making it one of the must-see places in California. Among the activities that people do here are to visit the amusement park, aquarium and fish. Or you can just sit back and people-watch. I did just that and I thought this is what defines the Santa Monica Pier",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/faris144
30,Just visiting for the day,A good place to go and check out if spending the day waiting for a flight. pretty easy to get to with bus.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/360waynel
40,Fun visit,"Fun visit today, easy to park at the mall and then walk to the pier. Plenty to see, eat and do. It looked very crowded but by the time we got to the end of the pier it wasn't crowded at all. No charge unlike other piers we have visited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luckyno39
50,wonderful time,we spend a wonderfull time at the Pier and saw the most beautiful sunset. Also the nice Mexican Restaurant is worth to visit with many delicious dishes. We would like to go back there!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/573JudithB

50,Fantastic,Spent a few hours on the pier. Loads to see and do. Well worth a visit. We went as part of a day tour and found it to be well worthwhile,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P4329MRmattc
50,Just the place to wind down!,A lovely place to wander and enjoy the scenery and people watch. You can spend a lot or nothing and still have a great time. Watching the sun set over the Pacific Ocean was beautiful - particularly since I usually watch it rise over the Pacific Ocean. At the end of the pier are bleachers to watch the sunset. Obviously everyone else enjoyed the sunset too as most clapped as the sun disappeared.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/303benee
50,the best place on Earth!,"Amazing place to go with children or on your own. One of the most famous places thanks to various movies. Great rollercoaster - lots of fun! amazing ocean, lots of activities to attend to. Love this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shyanp2015
50,Fun for the teens,Spent an afternoon here on our recent trip to California. It was New Years Eve so it was very very crowded. But my teenagers loved it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PMFANDME
50,A MUST FOR FAMILIES!!,"We are a family of 4 (10 yr old boy & 13 yr old boy) this was our first trip to California. 3 full days and on the last day we went to Santa Monica Pier. It was wonderful ! If you only have 1 day in California Santa Monica Pier is a must. There are so many amazing things about this place, everything you dream about visiting California is here. Our boys loved it more than any other destination & Hollywood Blvd is about even. We live near the gulf coast but this beach was amazing!1. Everywhere you look is beautiful !2. The pier is filled with amazing people and talents! ( & yes some homeless but that is common anywhere around these areas)3. We loved eating at the Mexican food restaurant at the end of the pier.4. Seals can be seen swimming about5. The rides were great and worth the $30 all you can ride bands!6. Popeye was a real guy from here!7. Loved Zoltar from BIG at the game room.8. The ice Cream was soooo GREAT !9. People watching was entertaining10. OH & then theres the Beach, no matter how cold take your shoes off and dip your toes into that amazing water & sand!11. even though we had our kids with us it felt like we were on our first date together. Laughing , playing in the arcade & holding hands. When the kids are having fun so can the parents!Even if its chilly take an extra jacket because at night it get cold.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JDF3854IV
30,Great views of the sunset,"We almost didn't come to this place, but the timing was right, close to sunset, so we made the trip.A few tips: Come on to the pier and park on the left. That parking is on a half hourly basis. Parking on the right is flat fee.Bring an additional layer of clothing, it gets cold.There is a lower deck all the way at the end that is closer to the water and better for pictures.Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BuckCRNA
50,Beautiful,Absolutely beautiful. Can't describe the sunset--you need to see it for yourself. It's unforgettable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petuniablackbird
40,A fun day in sunny California,"The pier is lovely, you start walking to it from the famous ""Santa Monica Pier"" sign on the boardwalk and start your way through people, bikes, musicians, artists, the sign of the ending of ""Route 66"" and at the very end you'll have incredible views of the sea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrPaulagrace
40,Fun Day Trip,Went here with my boyfriend on our LA vacation. It was very beautiful with a lot to see and do. Definitely worth a trip if your visiting LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tibeamon
30,Santa Monica Pier,"Beautiful yet very touristy area of SM. Rides are fun, food nothing special, but the views of the ocean, ah, gorgeous. Weekday visits are best.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nspoylo
50,Great place for the whole family.,"A must see if you are in the LA area for a day or an entire summer. Its the old time carnival that I remember as a kid surrounded by ocean. Cotten candy, fired dough, corn dogs and everything that is bad for you if only for a day. Worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I759XQmarkd
40,Cool place to be but mostly fun for kids,We visited in December when its cold so there's not many people playing at the water except for near the pier. However the pier was more lively. The pier offers a cool view of the bay and ocean especially at the tip and also from the ferris wheel at the amusement park on the pier. The amusement park at the pier mostly features fun for kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jiachaol
30,Very average,"Didn't really find anything special about the pier, it's ok for a walk along, but nothing to get excited about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sparkster7
50,Fun place,"Last day in L. A. And took an uber down to the pier. Small amusement rides, ice cream, vendors, restaurants , merry go round. Fun! Worth the time to stop and enjoy this with the shops nearby. Put it on the list! Oh yeah, forgot the beach😀",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dvbreck
50,Riding a rainbow,"Honestly! Feels like riding a rainbow! Let you inner kid out and have some good fun! No matter if coming on your own, with friends or family - this will be a memorable experience to make you smile long time after your visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eugeneb498
50,Christmas vacation,Always a fun place. Always seems crowded but nice. Always a tourist favorite. Parking can be difficult. Nice place to get right up to the ocean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/928jenw
20,Stay away from the Pier.,just look at it from afar...way too many people for a few little rides. it's a total waste of time. food choices are minimum. view from Ferris wheel is probably only reason for going,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ypat
40,Fun for our toddler,We had fun on the rides at the Santa Monica Pier. Perfect weather. Our toddler had fun on the rides. We even had a brief conversation with a movie star there with her toddler.Plenty of parking. We went on a weekday about noon time. View is great. Ocean is beautiful. Plenty of bathroom facilities. Musicians playing music on the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeachbumHB
50,So much more then we expected,"We have been to many piers in California. Santa Monica actually had a lot of action going on. A little amusement park, an arcade, an aquarium, shopping (very little) Lots of food vendors. Best of all some incredible views and great place to people watch.Parking is fun because you actually can park on the pier.. It is $3/hr I believe but it was really simple to find parking.We walked around and took in the beautiful view of the ocean. Didn't really partake in any of the amusement stuff. Got some food and walked along the beach. Not much in shells in the area, mostly muscles from the pier and a few oyster shells.A few people were walking around with metal detectors. So this seems like a decent place for that.Great views, nice beach, lots of food, and a little bit of shopping. Makes this a nice place to visit. Though families with younger children (mine is 18) may benefit more from the amusement park aspect of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LVgabeg
50,I LOVE Skeeball,"This is a proper old time beach pier. My favorite part is the arcade with skeeball, air hockey, and other fun games, but there's also a cool old carousel, musicians, beach food everywhere. Even a little drizzle did not deter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ken0739
30,Not sure it quite lived up to our hype but still a pleasant experience,"The pier was busy and quite commercialised. I don't really know what I was expecting but for some reason it didnt really live up to my expectations. I think our highlight was watching the kids paddling in the ocean thinking its amazing they are on the other side of the Pacific ocean now. Parking was relatively easy and the pier itself was quite busy. We didnt go on any rides but the kids admired them. Dinner was a choice of any quick greasy cuisine on the boardwalk or we could have waited for one of the restaurants. All in all, I'm glad we visited. I think next time I'd take some time to explore the other beaches in the area and sample a slightly more upmarket restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haylis335
40,Lovely place to visit,"Lots to see and do. Many eateries. It was very crowded the day we were there. It was a beautiful day, so people were out and about. Some were swimming. Lots of activity and lots of people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joaniemaria
50,Beautiful,It was very windy and cool while we were there the 1st day but the pier is fun and the views amazing. It rained the 1st day and most of the shops and places were closed. The 2nd time we went over there it was sunny and many of the places were open. The pier is a lot of fun and a must do if in the area! I bet in the summer this place is really amazing!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cheryllsr
50,Fun walk with lots to see,"Restaurants are touristy but this is a tourist place so you get what you expect. Lots of street performers to look at, trinket stores and you can walk on the beach when you are done.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kiwig14
50,Fun to visit,"Great scenery, fun, full of life and full of people. I had a hotdog there, unique and delicious.Full of people that make the place alive!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ahmed-AlOzairi
50,Beautiful scenery,"We visited this beautiful place at the beginning of December 2015 & I have to say it is definitely one of the most loveliest scenic places ever. We made our own way there rather than getting a tour bus and we took our time and looked around . We found it was the best way to do this than worry about a tour bus and the time restrictions they put on you. We spent the majority of the day enjoying all the ambiance that Santa Monica has to offer .The pier itself is very clean, their toilets are also clean and the views from wherever you walk on the pier is absolutely stunning . Going around in December to the pier , we were lucky that we missed having the huge crowds that you see in their summer season & it was so much better in December. Even though it is winter the weather was hot and sunny and without the huge crowds shoving and pushing . There are a lot of souvenir shops, restaurants and an adjacent fun park catering for the young and old. If you are a fan of the movie Forest Gum, they have a huge store called Bubba Gum ! You can buy all then souvenirs relating to the movie. They also have the famous Route 66 store and in there you can buy all the original clothes made in USA and various souvenirs relating to the famous Route 66. Don't forget to stop and take a photo next to the end of the road sign ""Route 66"". There are people busking playing music instruments or singing . It is a lively place to visit. If you are in LA you have to put Santa Monica Pier on your list of sightseeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulettea621
30,Fun to watch people and waves,It is very close from the downtown and has the pier.Kids are having fun at the small amusement park.It is a nice place hang out for a while.Parking is $3 per hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theworldanddaniel
40,Very nice during summer time,We visited Santa Monica when we were staying in Long Beach. The traffic was a disaster but a walk in the pier makes you forget about the traffic. A nice view and while we're lucky since there was a sail competition going on.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/family-van-den-Berg
50,The best sunset ever!,"I had the opportunity to watch the sunset at the Santa Monica Pier, both were during the winter but both were perfect! This is such a nice place to be with family or friends, they have parking lot, a lot of restaurants and souvenirs stores.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C3203ZQcarolp
50,Love it,"This is such a fun place. Lots of people and there is always something unexpected that happens. Great food and good place to bring kids to, they have ride there and other child friendly stuff. I just love being able to go to a place like this that by the sea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Radhakrsns
50,Schmaltzy but very California,Very very crowded at sunset but heck if you are visiting CA Go. We were serenaded by a wonderful musician with classic 60's music while we waited for sunset. There are bleachers to watch from. The sun slipped over the horizon with polite clapping from the crowd. We rode the Ferris wheel $8. ea then hightailed it up the ramp to wait for Uber. Of course it was surge but so was the crowd and we were happy to leave,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susaninstlouis2014
40,A Famous Land Mark...,"This pier is another famous Land mark.Like any other pier its having all the fun filled activities like rides, dining and shopping.Great fun for kids and of course burgers are great .Also good for spending time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NaureenY

50,Place Is a buzz,"Lots of people, great to visit. Really enjoyed going there and having a look. Big pier with plenty to do. Travelled Aug 2014.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mickcharleafe
40,Fun Day at The Pier,"My husband and I were visiting from Illinois. So of course Santa Monica is beautiful. We spent quite some time walking the beach in the morning. Then we walked to the Pier. The Pier looked like a great place for families. They had plenty of food choices, shopping places, clean bathrooms and fun rides. We never felt crowded or unsafe although there was plenty of people. We spent about 2 hours walking around looking at homes down the beach and then walked up to the street where the hotels and restaurants were. Too many homeless people everywhere once you walk up to the main street making the vibe a little more stressful and less safe. But i'm sure its that way in most big cities. But nothing like that at the Pier. The beach and Pier were beautiful. We didn't stay in Santa Monica because of the high prices but if I had to do it again I would. Just too beautiful to pass up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ab162
50,Must do late afternoon,"This is a must do activity. Walk, take photos and watch people. The crowd is half the fun. We played old fashioned pinball machines and watched fishing by locals. The buskers are quite good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jen-JMelb
50,Always Fun on a Nice Day,"It can be a bit crowded, depending on when you go, but it's always fun. There are street musicians, shops, and, best of all, the pier itself. Great views at the end of it, and you just may see a seal or two.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davemh333
40,Without peer,"We always enjoy the pier and for us no visit is complete without having a Pier Burger, in my opinion one of the best burgers around. People watching is always fun. The carousel is exceptional and the kids love it. If buskers are your thing there are lots to choose from. The rides are also fun. If you go to Santa Monica you need to visit the pier at the end of Route 66",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/383grahamd
30,Churro,Had a great time. Go listen to the water. It's so powerful. Make sure to spend time with the artists there. They have so much talent to offer this world. Was able to pick up some one of a kind pieces that I will cherish forever. Also tried Churros for the first time. Find someone to split it with...they are massive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikkiD23
40,"Iconic spot, good fun","Its really fun to walk about the pier and check out the shops, restaurants and unique people who make LA such an interesting place. The ferris wheel is fun and reasonably priced. Plenty of photo ops!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AussieMike37
40,An enjoyable place to spend a couple of hours,"There are some fun Route 66 landmarks at the pier as this is the 'end of Route 66'. We are big Route 66 fans, and we enjoyed experiencing that aspect of Santa Monica. There are lots of little souvenir shops on the pier, restaurants, bars, and the amusement parks to entertain you. The ocean views are lovely and the breeze keeps you comfortable. We visited the pier during the afternoon and later at night when the ferris wheel was all lit up. It was quite pretty and added to our Santa Monica experience. The vibe on the pier is laid back and fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SouthwestRoadTripper
40,Family Fun,"It was neat to see the pier, kids would love it, but as a couple it was ok. Nice to see the ocean and view all the people. They have some shops and a great bar/dining place below the pier that is awesome! (Can't remember name right now).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angel627
30,Such a busy place...,"...but worth a visit. The restaurants are a little expensive, as are the rides and it is usually quite crowded but it's a fun time if you go on some rides, eat and hang out on the beach a bit. The roads are very busy so one must have patience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunnygirlC
40,Nice Evening Stroll,"We came here after dinner in Marina Del Ray. Parking was $6 in the nearby lot. We strolled along the pier to check out all the attractions, vendors and restaurants. This is a great place for a family, friends or a couple. It was lovely all lit up at night. It also is a great place to people watch. It felt like we were at the local fairgrounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kpatters
50,See the beach and all its splender.,The Pier is fun for the whole family. Its a place to take people who come and visit from other countries. On a clear day you can see the Palos Verdes Peninsula and Catalina. A must to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YvonneU17
20,Trashy meets touristy,Go to a trailer park followed by a creepy arcade in Florida instead. I'm half kidding. I guess there's some kitschy flair but I wouldn't consider it anything other than a waste of time. I know - what a snob ;),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brenncc
30,Fun but expenseove,Nice stop off the board walk but it's not a destination I'd seek out! It's $8 per ride on Ferris wheel or roller coaster. We didn't eat there -- food didn't look good or healthful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolinenyc2015
30,Ticked off a tourist attraction,"Good to see, nice stroll, interesting to watch a film crew filming a part of a movie down below, nothing spectacular but worth a visit if you are in the area",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SebbyCait
40,Visit to the famous landmark,"Short morning visit to the pier, beautiful day. Had a ride on the roller coaster which gave a great view over the beach.Mainly went for the view and to get some photos. Worth the visit if in the area",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattf780
50,Help the Homeless and Stranded!,"We met a young homeless girl there. Very sad situation, she was going to jail the next week. She had on someone else's clothes, five sizes too big. Her name was Jessica. She was someone's daughter, someone's sister, someone's friend, maybe someone's mother. Please don't act like she is invisible!!!! We sat and and bought lunch for her. Don't just stare!!! Please don't notice the amusement parks, the beach, the boardwalk, But notice your fellow human beings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Realtorondemand
30,Alright visit,"Just a famous pier with tonnes of people, the iconic rollcoaster, restaurants and people selling stuff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelJT19
40,Fun Day at the Pier,"We had a great time at the pier. They have a smaller amusement park with various rides, ferris wheel and a roller coaster plus games. The ride passes were reasonable and the line ups to get on the rides were no more than about 10 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/onip1969
50,Lovely place!,"Such a lovely view. Went on the Ferris wheel ride and merry go round! Fun and busy place! There are amusement arcades, places to eat and drink, and gift shops!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saleha3
40,Sunsets,Although it was very windy and cold when I went I enjoyed a nice walk at the pier. There's plenty to see but I especially went there to see a beautiful sunset. It's just the perfect place to go see one. To bad I was cold because I would have loved to go on the ferris wheel or roller coaster. If you're hungry there's little food shacks that you can choose from. Everytime I visit Santa Monica I just stay long enough to see the sunsets!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gigi_love715
50,Get Your Kicks at the End of Route 66!,"Santa Monica Pier is a great place to spend some time with family or friends. I've been here twice. Once with family and friends and more recently on my own. There are shops, restaurants and for the young and young-at-heart, there is Pacific Park with a roller coaster, Ferris Wheel and lots of other fun rides. Movie buffs will remember that Forrest Gump ran all the way to the end of the pier and then ran back to the East Coast again. Of course there is a sign calling attention to the fact that old Route 66 ended at the Santa Monica pier (which everyone likes to have their photo taken with). And if just remembering that Forrest Gump ran to the end of the pier is not enough for you, you can eat at the Bubba Gump shrimp company restaurant or just buy a souvenir at their gift shop! And as Forrest so famously remarked, ""And that's all I have to say about that.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GRANDDADGREENGO
50,"Cute fair, tasty treats!","The pier has games to play, a few rides to enjoy and delicious food!We had the japadog stand and it was so delicious! It's a Japanese hotdog and the flavours are out of this world.It's a cute date night idea if you don't want to spend a lot of money but are looking to get out and do something.The water itself is actually really clean. While it was a bit too cold to go swimming while we were there in December, we put our feet in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raykz

50,Stunning from the beach at night,"Come down to the beach at night and watch the lights on the ferris wheel, it is just beautiful. Also fun to ride at night!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GdeL8785
30,See the crowd,"The pier and the adjacent playground did not offer me anything unique or new. However, there were four things that seemed appealing: 1) the Sunday exhibition of the veteran peace makers next to the pier on the beach. It is very informative and it gives an inside-out picture of war against terror from the American people's perspective. 2) trampoline and bouncing experience with training 3) getting your name written on rice grain by the Latino artists 4) buying an unbelievably realistic finger and brush painting on mirror and glass (don't hesitate buying your Santa Monica Pier souvenir there from the Latino painters starting from USD 5.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mehrdad-Moloudi
40,Open Christmas Day,"My husband and I were in the area and stopped by on the way to see family--what a neat attraction! We were surprised that parking was available on the pier. There are lots of little restaurants and shops, in addition to the affordable amusement park area. Great place to take photos and selfies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheRonsWife

40,A nice afternoon out,"We were here for the afternoon and went to the aquarium, Bubba Gump for lunch, rode the carousel, and walked under the pier. The amusement park was too expensive for us but it was a nice time out in the sun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllisonHyatt
50,Great place,Free to visit and lots to do and places to eat. Amazing sunset pictures and great picture opportunities of the coastline. Lots of history and of course the end of the line for Route 66,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hoss_13
50,It is wonderful place for people watching,"The Santa Monica Pier is one of the better places for people watching in Santa Monica. Several restaurants, gift shops and a amusing park. Love just watching the people on the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Estjwm
20,Not sure what the big deal is!,This was our first trip to Santa Monica. Based on recent reviews and hearing about this place from others we decided to stop by. Not sure what the big deal is. First of all you have to pay $8 to park. Then the pier was so crowded we walked half way up and back then left. No need to go back here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Familyoffourplustwo
50,a must do,Great venue for families. Rides that offer unlimited rides possibilities or a single ride. Artists that watercolor your name and portrait. Photo opportunities with many views. The Route 66 ends here sign was one huge attraction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/71deanp
40,Nice Attraction,"This was a nice attraction. Although I had already been here, it is nice to come back to, especially to see the sunset from the pier. The rides are fun and there is plenty to see, do, and eat right on the pier. Do note: towards the afternoon and near sunset, the pier does get very crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/629brendanp
50,Romantic getaway,I was there for 1 weekend and it was awesome. Going in the big wheel at sunset is one of the most romantic things one can do. Truest worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cityjump3r
40,Typical but nice,"The pier was not amazing in any way but nice to walk out on. Our hotel was right across the street, so we came out at various times. Fun people watching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ckster
20,Quiet place in winter,"We came in Dec and pretty early in the morning so the area was quite a ghost town.But we liked the quietness, just walking along the pier and the beach. It's a few minutes walk to nearby 3rd street promenade and Santa Monica place. It's definitely a nicer shopping experience on a weekday morning when there was no crowd. :)Tip though! Don't park at the beach. Parking is free for the first 90 minutes at the parking structures 1-6 for 3rd street promenade. Park there and walk to the pier!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/984panx
40,Feel good vibe,"The vibe was feel good all over the place. The carnival was a good place to start. If you're not a fan of the rides, taking pictures against the backdrop will do. I love that there are several acts performing along the pier. Musicians, singers, magicians... The musicians have actual cds you can buy.It's a good way to spend the weekend with kids or just hang out with friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mercury0601
40,Santa Monica pier,A lovely place to stroll along and soak up the atmosphere. Some quaint shops and interesting places to browse. The most fantastic place to enjoy the amazing sunsets. Enjoyed strolling around the ambient carnival and even had to have a go on the roller coaster.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cazd2016
50,A cliché - and a good one!,"I am a sucker for hotdogs, beer and carnival rides, so it is hard to give an unbiased review! Just a fun place to be and soak up the atmosphere. Well worth a visit. Walk to the end of the pier for great views of the pier activity, ocean and Venice Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JYNZ
30,Ok for a short stop,"Neat to see an old style California attraction but was too touristy for us. Recommend go to end of pier climb up to enjoy view, then leave and eat elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PattyB789
50,Great Landmark,"The Santa Monica Pier is a must do.It cost nothing to walk out on the pier, but you must find a place to park, which might cost a few bucks.There are many things to do and see. Talented street performers are everywhere.It is a great place to catch the sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/korndogizard
40,Fairly entertaining,"Parking is reasonable and convenient. The pier has several rides for kids, which my 3 year old enjoyed alot. I would recommend watching each ride first, a couple were more aggressive than they looked as they were stopped. Free entrance into the park. Rides are between $4-$8 or you can buy an unlimited ride pass for $16-$26. Several restaurants and shops along the pier. Nice views of the ocean and the beach is easy access. Beach is huge and seemed clean. Water was too cold at the time to go in. L.A. water is best in summer and Fall for temperature.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Charliecheeto2012
50,Teen first visit to Pacific,We were staying Hollywood and wanted to visit here.The tours of homes often make a stop here as well. We just wanted to visit the pier and dip our feet in the ocean.We chose public transportation (bus) and it worked great...only one transfer.This area is beautiful!We did not ride any rides but enjoyed the carnival like atmosphere.The beach was perfect!Of course the water was cold this time of year but we had fun wading for a bit.Would not hesitate to come back again!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hawkeyetob
50,Stopped for a few hours while passing through,"The Santa Monica Pier is pretty cute. It's family friendly or great for solo travelers like myself. There are a few public parking ramps nearby. I was pretty surprised when I found that the parking ramp only cost $1.00 (which I think was for the first hour or two) and even after the first few hours the prices were incredibly reasonable.The pier is filled with shops, rides (roller coaster, ferris wheel, etc. ) and plenty of food choices. There are several street performers, mostly playing music and/or singing. There are a ton of restaurants all within waling distance of the pier as well as coffee shops and some shopping.There were public restrooms just before entering the pier, although they were not super clean, they worked. I think you can purchase day passes for the rides on the pier (around $25) or you pay around $8 per ride. The ferris wheel is 9 stories high and runs completely on solar power. There are nice views from the ferris wheel.All in all, a good stop if you have time to kill or the family wants some entertainment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CeceN_13
40,Must do,Just a nice place you must do if you are nearby. It's a nice pier with a lot of amusements and restaurants. Worth spending a hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/perhedelin
20,I guess it's okay if that's your sort of thing,"Went between Christmas and New Year's and it was packed!!!!! with tourists. Typically cheesy, overpriced boardwalk-type stuff. But worth it just to see the sign where Route 66 ends. The beach is nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carilovestotravel
40,Fun place to visit,"A good place to visit with family and friends. People enjoying a walk along the pier, waiting and watching sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/uniqueisland
50,End of Route 66,A definite tourist trap...but a check the box attraction when in LA. Great people watching and a nice view as well. Worst an hour or two. You can also visit the 3rd street promenade which is also fun ! Make sur to walk up the stairs and get an overall view fron the second floor of the building at the end of the pier. See my picture....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Love2Explr
50,What fun!,"On pier parking. Excellent! Enjoy the people watching and the great little shops, food and coffee carts, and restaurants. Great ocean and beach views and some street performances create a nice family experience. Great place to spend a day without spending much money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steven858
40,Like a Movie Set,"This has a carnival setting. Lots of street performers lining the pier, which made it fun and entertaining. Plenty of places to eat, like Bubba Gump's, which was a good place to go. If you go early in the morning, not much is open and there are lots of street people, but that could be said for anywhere in Santa Monica in the morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JRD222
40,A great walk with lots to see,"We spent 1-2 hours walking down the pier. We saw a fantastic magician, looked out on the beautiful ocean, and our kids rode the merry-go-round. Very cute. A nice experience. Highly recommend if you have a few hours to spend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ushma
30,A bit underwhelming,It was nice and pretty but nothing fantastically special. Nice place to stop for some food but not to spend loads of time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/370rachelp
40,Lovely walk,"We have been to LA a few times, but never walked to the end of Santa Monica Pier. Its a lovely walk, buskers all along the way of all kinds of music, a variety of fast food places and rides for people. We just walked to the end and back and really enjoyed it. Early morning walk is less crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craigeelinks
50,The place to go!,"Excellent food, great shopping, but mostly great people and activity watching! Been going to Santa Monica for years, and always spend a few hours enjoying the atmosphere of the Pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeterLorenzo
50,Fun but really for young kids,Gorgeous views and something to see but no rides for adults. Street musicians great people watching and eateries a definite must see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hisharel
50,Had a few days in LA,"If in LA this should be on your list. The aera is nice, clean and beautiful. Has something for everyone. Shopping at 3rd st. Promenade is only blocks away. Great beach and picture taking opportunities. I recommend not driving get the metro card and take advantage of LA great metro train and bus",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/34amire
50,Classic attraction worth visiting,Forget about all the touristy stuff going on along the pier. Just take in the views of the Pacific Ocean and coastline from Santa Monica to Pacific Palisades.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Raboff
50,Full of Fun,"Santa Monica Pier is a must see if you are in SM. There are plenty of car spaces available close by, the pier has an aquarium, small theme park, carousel, restaurants, buskers, novelty shops and amazing coastline views. It is free to walk along the pier, we also took a ride on the ferris wheel ($8 each). They allow you to take your camera on the ride so you can get some great shots from the top. So many talented buskers along the pier as well, worth stopping by to admire their talent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EliseH9
30,Must go to tick the box...,"Worth a visit. For the pier itself you can count on an hour and a half. There's parking right by the pier for 8 Usd or you can use others parking lots close by for a higher price but closer to the walking areas.View is nice, you can see lots of different people visiting, there are coffee, restaurants and souvenir shops. There is a mini theme park but the rides are not ready worth it. Its mostly for younger kids to enjoy. All overpriced but considering the location it is as expected.Moving away from the Pier you can take the beach walkway that will take you all the way to Venice beach.In the start of that path you can see a lot of people practicing all kinds of exercises which is quite interesting to watch. Its a combination of gymnastics by using bars and handles and doing some really interesting routines...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grbr07
30,Fun,The Santa Monica pier is one of those places you want to see particularly if you have seen the film Big. It's nice and it's fun but small and the movie makes it to be far bigger than it is. Not a lot to do some street vendors and performers we had lunch at bubba gumps. Very touristy thing to do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dani_Matt
50,Pier Sunset,My family and I never get tired of this place. It's always a good idea to watch the sun go down and people watch here. There's almost always a singer or musician at the end of the pier. Yesterday was a violinist playing the Titanic song. We park in the parking structure off Colorado before 2nd Street and walk straight onto the pier. It's cheaper than the parking lot at the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valerien532
40,A great experience,"I had a great first experience here. It's very clean, there are amusement park rides, places to eat and shop. We just walked around to sight see. We even saw a celebrity walking around there. You never know who you might see. The only negatives I noticed were all the homeless people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soccerman4000
50,Must See!!,Our family loved Santa Monica walking the Pier and beach and eating at The Albright which is pricey but super quality food which everyone loved!! Place was clean and trendy and very very good. Eat here. Visiting Pier and beaches in late December so dress in layers although it was an amazing sunny day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Farleymon
50,The real US melting pot,"This is one of the most famous spots in America and I would say the real US melting pot where all come together, regardless. Great place to come and see all living in peace.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrazilACA
50,Relaxing,First time to visit the place and all I can say is that the place is relaxing. One can also indulge in having a food trip while walking or dip in the beach just a few meters down the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/louhanselg
40,A Must,"Santa Monica Pier is a must if you're visiting LA. We came in late November and walked from Venice Beach to the pier (which took about an hour) and watched the sunset. Bring something warm to wear if you're here this time of year. The Pier has many shops, great restaurants and rides for thrill seekers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Firey3
50,Cute,"Loved the pier was on holiday with my 8 friends. Weather was beautiful so we had a wonder round and went on the big wheel, followed by going to bubba gump",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Indiarose1
50,Just like the good old days,"Good, clean family fun, just like fairs and fun parks used to be before technology took over. A gorgeous walk along the pier with plenty to see including albatross, seals and fish. The rides are old and cranky but fun nonetheless. Beware of pick pockets!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LilH_11
30,Bit tacky,Okay for one visit stalls for retail not great food is mainly fish not much choice but I went seen it had a good day couldn't go everyday if I was on beach holiday Venice beach lot better,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2marilynb
50,Great day on the beach,"We made a run over to Sant Monica from Vegas for the day. The pier is a must see attraction. we enjoyed the walk out to the end, heard some good street music and loved the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/626JimR
30,Santa Monica Pier,"It is nice place especially due to near the Pacific OceanI saw firstly an oceanAnd beach is very long, I want to be here in summer holiday :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vozturk02
20,Just a fairground,Not much here other than rides and rubbish food. It does have bubba gump shrimp co which was funny. Not impressed better stuff to see,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/144LisaB144
30,Amazing space in tacky culture,The Pacific against the backdrop of the mountain and curve of the shoreline just opens your heart but try to ignore the signs about all of the contaminated fish that you can catch but cannot eat. And look out to sea away from the cras human mess of tacky joints nearby. I expected better from a major LA landmark.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marycN2457KJ
40,Fun and Nostalgic,"So happy places exist like this. Carnival rides, games, fishing dock, novelty shops! Just nice family fun. We even attempted to win a prize or two. Whac a mole is still the best game. Be sure to ride the iconic Ferris wheel. Expected better local food selections, mostly chain food like Taco Bell and bubba gump's were on the Pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drjpepper64
40,Great place to end Route 66,"Although not the original end point of Route 66, it is a special place no less. And there are a number of Route 66 gift shops on the pier. Talk to the guy in the Route 66 booth midway along the pier - he is full of great travel stories and a great range of Route 66 gifts - even a completion certificate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonybJ4656PN
50,Come at night!,"The breeze was cooling at night. It was extremely colorful and lively with many street games. For those coming to LA, please do visit this awesome place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tom8787
40,Picture perfect,"Super fun vibes on Santa Monica, lots of homeless beggers which is a shame because it's an awesome place, just not ideal when people keep asking for money!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B6277SIemmac
30,Touristy but still a must walk if you have not been there,It is very touristy and better looking from afar but still a nice walk through and people watching; wouldn't eat or buy anything there ...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Toyo3
50,Beautiful Beach With Nice Views Of Homes,"I liked seeing the homes along the coast. The Pier was clean, safe and fun although limited with number of shops, etc. It would be a great place to just sit and relax while watching the Pacific. I liked it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trjeff1
50,Fun!,"Great amusement park on the pier. Rides a little pricey, but it's the experience. Nice walk down the pier, a few places to eat. West end of Route 66 too.Nice beach area too.Recommend to spend at least 2-3 hours ( shorter if not going on rides). But worth the stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Movingalong1234
50,Lovely old pier.,Spent day at Santa Monica and enjoyed both the pier and the beach very much. The pier is free to access and has many attractions such as a Ferris wheel. There were also buskers adding to the festive atmosphere. Food and drink expensive but you could take your own picnic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nola103
50,Wish we had more time,"We visited Santa Monica Pier during a group tour. Wish we had more time here. Amazing scenery from the beaches to Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. Everything was super cool. Lots of places to eat, lots of things to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ohhseannyyy
40,A Fun Wlak - Must-do Sunset Experience,"An amusement park is an amusement park wherever you go, but, if in Santa Monica, this is a must-do activity. Very clean, very family-friendly and not at all seedy, it is especially neat at sunset, offering many wonderful photo ops from the pier itself as well as looking back at the pier from street path above.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/westsidecouple
40,Must be in your to do list,"You can't go to LA and not visit the Santa Monica pier. But I have to admit it's a lot smaller than I expected. If you're not into fairs and stuff, it's a max 30 minute walk around and you're done. But I suggest you look around, take in the breathtaking panoramas of the coast, get your compulsory selfies with the Ferris wheel, and visit one of the restaurants or cafes. I went to Bubba Gumbas for a beer and prawns. I didn't do the aquarium because I'm planning to come back and take the family, who'll be a lot more into all this than I am. It's a must-do as a tourist, but don't expect too much of it.A good tip: it's close to the airport. You could do it on your way to or from the airport. I went on my last afternoon before I had to fly home later that evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kiwigirl341
30,Too tourist orientated for me,"We returned to the pier for a repeat visit. It allows for good views back to Santa Monica, but had nothing rally further to offer (probably more child orientated).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnTravelsAgain
50,Always fun and something to see,"Nice place to visit during the day or evening. Plenty of parking and 3er street promenade is close by. There is a rollercoaster $8 on the pier. Restaurants, shops and arcade games.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lxjuarez
50,The Great Pier,"Our recent visit to the pier was so much more than we expected. Walking distance from downtown to pier. Be aware steep hill to climb down or up. Lots of great places to eat fresh seafood and other things. Vendors play music of different genre as you walk. Plan you trip to end at sunset at the end of the pier, well worth the wait. Beautiful. We went on a weekday night so it was not crowded. A really fun place to visit and some great photo opportunities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4428KatieL
50,Great place to hang out,"The Santa Monica Pier is a great place to sit and watch the sea, the scenery, and the world go by. Great eats.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GersonS851
40,Good place to unwind,It's a major fair! There were a lot of rides and games. We only did the games as my partner hates rides. We enjoyed the view of the ocean too. A lot of souvenirs can be bought at the place as well. You have to make reservations probably 1-2 hours before sunset at the restaurants so you get the best seat and view. Careful though with your stuff. There's a police precinct but not much police visibility.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizd621
50,Must visit.,"I played a game called GTA, it looks the same! Beautiful, and i even saw a dolphin near the dock where people were fishing. They even have mini roller coaster.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seungb_13
40,Fun way to spend a couple of hours,"Beautiful view, fun atmosphere. You can watch Pelicans dive for food, buy art from vendors, listen to people sing, eat, go on rides, spend a little money, a lot of money, or nothing at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappiTravelerchicago
50,Cute and iconic,"Came here in November 2014. The weather was surprisingly warm and we managed to come at a great time when there was barely a crowd. Very family friendly and plenty of places to eat. Not a huge place, but rather a cute pier where you can spend the day and enjoy a couple rides and the beautiful beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/17jamiej
40,Great for First Time,"I think all visitors must visit this place at least once. But it has a romantic feel to it... It's a nice place to return for a quick meal or merely a funnel cake while enjoying sunset or watch tourists go by or just enjoy the singing of the baskers.If you are lucky, you might catch a glimpse of a sea lion in the waves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrizLim
50,Scratch one thing off my bucket list,"I am a big fan of Route 66 and I have always wanted to visit the Santa Monica pier because that wad the western end of Route 66, the Mother Road. I loved the large sign designating the end of Route 66 and found it to be a beautiful place. It was enjoyable just to walk around & visit the shops. I also was impressed with the quality of street musicians on the pier. I listened to 3 and they were all very impressive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ABoomer48
40,Fun Park wth View $$$,"This is a fun, but not very large amusement park. Views of the ocean and city are great, but ride passes can be pricey since you pay for each attraction, and parking isn't cheap, either. Worse case scenario, you'll pay $25 for a multiride package per person and $10-$15 to park and walk at least a quarter-mile on the beach to the pier. I loved the place and had fun, it was just more expensive than I expected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debbier339
50,Very touristy!,Classic icon known world wide! Always expect to see foreigners and tourist groups here. The pier has enough entertainment to easily last a full day. Don't forget to watch the sunset from the pier!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevinsoun
40,"Been around for a while, but still great","This one has been around for a while but it still has the magic. Wth the beach right there and all the rides, food available on the pier and all the pretty girls this place is heaven on earth. I didn't try any of the restaurants on the pier because there are some absolutely wonderful places to eat on the other side of the street. This is a great place to relax and spend the day, and I highly recommend you catch one of the bonfires on the beach after it gets dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tom24527
40,One of the few left.,"The Santa Monica Pier is one of the few if not only oldstyle piers left in California. A few decades ago the pier was going to be torn down and the citizens of Santa Monica thankfully stopped it. The pier still has an old fashioned fun zone with skeetball and cotton candy. Also has a ferris wheel, roller coaster and rides for kids along with the usual pier food. No fancy restaurants unless you consider Bubba Gumps fancy. You should visit if you're at the beach. Very busy in the summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/morrisk446
50,Amazing Sunset views,"This little boardwalk brings excitement to your day. It boasts amazing views of Santa Monica from the pier, as well as amazing views of the Sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jgrimsle
30,It's OK,"I wouldn't call this the most fascinating place in Santa Monica. It's fun to visit maybe once or twice. Mainly just gift shops and a few rides, and a couple of restaurants. Good thing is it's right by the beach so you can visit both at the same time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krystalxpink
20,Over crowded and not sure what the fuss is about,The lines are very long for anything. The boardwalk is partially outdated and needs to be replaced. There are too many people that is is uncomfortable. Don't waste your time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tahirihcc
40,Fun in the sun.,"I took my friends here to check out the fun things the pier bendirs have to offer. Although the parking is not the greatest, once you get on the pier, the sound of waves and seagulls calm the nerves and melts the stress. There are many street enrertainers on the pier and we felt safe at all times. We did not get on any of the rides, but we did eat. The food was like any other carnival like places including the prices. This is a great place to get away for a while even if just for a day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/31sylvaniam
50,After a paddle in the pacific a walk on the pier,"Always wanted to paddle in the pacific, then we walked along the beach to the pier and walked down the old wooden pier. It was lovely. We then had a meal in Gumps on their which was great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juiannec
40,Beautiful scenery,"This place has beautiful scenery from the streets of palm trees down to the beach and the pier. Its got loads of restaurants on the ocean avenue strip and the pier is full of laughter, fun activities, shops and musicians. A violinist was playing 'my heart will go on' - celine dion and it was beautiful. So pop down and you might see him!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F3870YFalessandrac
30,"Looks nice, but one visit is enough",This iconic area is a bit of a let down. There are a couple of restaurants and an out dated theme park area. There is little shade and nothing to actually do if you are wandering. From the beach however it looks interesting and is great for photos.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nlhere
30,Fun but quiet in winter,"We knew it would be quiet in the winter, so we weren't disappointed that there was no 'hustle and bustle'.We thought the views back toward Santa Monica were great. The historic Carousel, games arcade, restaurants (especially Bubba Gump), ferris wheel and information on the pier's history and lookout at the end of the pier were great.Worth a visit any time in our view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gavinh799
30,Must Do Tourist Spot End of Route 66??,"We decided to take Big Blue Bus #12 from hotel in Westwood for $1 to see pier & beach. Must say it's pretty in pictures and overhyped; however, I'll always have good memories of having been there. It was worth it. Yes there are beggars & handlers, but that's all tourist spots. We just went with clothes on our backs. I just thought it was bigger based on pictures/TV, so you can easily see it all in under 2 hours. We didn't ride the rides as I'm currently unable. Learned pier is supposedly the official end of Route 66. Nice since that's the only part I've been on! Restrooms were big disappointment as they looked like they had not been cleaned in months.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Belleprogrammer
30,Fun place with a good atmosphere,We took our 13-year-old twin boys here. Being from the Jersey shore the boardwalk/Pier had very little to offer in the way of games and rides.It was a nice walk with convenient parking. They were vendors and musicians along the pier. Most of these people are very talented. Pier also offers fishing. We were lucky enough to see a seal floating in the water. It appeared to be looking at all the people that were looking down at it. LOL,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dalep524
30,Nothin special,"Personally I didn't see a great deal to attract people here , reminded me a bit of Blackpool !! Only warmer and without the rain , lol, still nice to stroll along though , felt safe enough too ,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/915artp
50,quick look at the Pacific,"Love this place! Clean and fun. Great access to the beach, could have sat there all day and watched the waves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrishAdvisor39
30,It wasn't what I had expected,I guess when you have constant images shown to you on tv it can sometimes be disappointing. It was way too busy and crowded which made it so hard to move and see things. There were so many people begging for money and food which was sad. It was more enjoyable to see it from a distance at night with all the beautiful lights...gave it a slight romantic look!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kozmohiggins
50,A nice stroll by the Beach,This is a nice pier. It has tons of stuff to do for everyone. The mini amusement park is great for families. It's good for couple who wants a nice stroll by the beach. There is also and area dedicated for fishing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/celin_sv
30,Kinda Dirty Tourist Trap That for Whatever Reason You Feel Obligated to Visit,"Maybe the best way to experience this pier is to view it from afar, while chilling on the beach, soaking up the warm rays. The food is what you would expect from a tourist trap, the rides expensive, and each inch regulated to someone trying to sell you something. If you can push through all of this you can get right to the end where you can take in the ocean. But then again you can do this on the beach as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattlL2974HR
50,Fun,"I don't know why people would give this such a bad rating. Ok, you may see a couple of hobos, but they won't hurt you. In fact my friend and I laugh when we see hobos doing funny things, they don't harm. The rides are fun, with nice restaurants. Ocean views, rides, food, and just a good place to hang out with performers and arcade. Great place. Don't listen to the bad reviews.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lngtraveler123
40,Perfect amusement park for our family,"It's small enough that you don't spend a whole day, or a whole pay check. The people are nice and it's in the center of everything so there is lots to do in the surrounding area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y2403JRstevend
40,touristy but a must do.,"if you are in Santa Monica this is a must. a stroll down the pier through the carnival getting a fake tattoo or eating some peanuts. watch the fishermen and the other ""ecentrics"" and enjoy people watching while waiting for the sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aggietraveler1976
40,Stop over from LA to SF,We passed by Santa Monica Pier from LA to SF.. The night view is nice and we enjoy the cold breeze while walking there.....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joelo4
40,Great for sunset,A bit dated and cheesy but we went on the big wheel at sunset and it looked beautiful. Went to watch the buskers at the end of the pier afterwards which was nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ben_blt
50,Love this place for sunset on the pier,"I feel alive walking the boardwalk of Santa Monica Pier area, watching the weird and the wonderful people with everything from wacky bikes to interesting characters on the monkey bars practicing their tricks on the rings. The surfers surf, the dog walkers mix with the skateboarders and it just reeks of life being lived. People chilling, doing what they do. I usually offer to do a photo or two and meet some nice people. The pier is good for a stroll and there's the usual tourist tat to buy, but some of it is fun, the singers on the pier are brilliant to listen to, and my favourite is being there for the sun setting at the end of the pier. Magical. You can see that people have fun in the Fayre ground too, not my cup of tea really but it's great to see people carrying round massive teddy bears they have won on the games in the Fayre. Always a great afternoon when we go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/353VanessaA
40,Its all about the day you pick.,"I am just saying it right away, I loooove this tourist spot. It is still nice to visit from time to time even if you live in LA. I would take a stroll on the pier anytime, good weather or bad weather (LA bad, no rain, tempertures above 60 etc etc). Parking and crowds is the issue, stay away on high season saturdays and sundays, and also holidays. Parking is not a problem out of season, just use the lot next to the pier, it is quite affordable out of season too. Enjoy and take pictures, enjoy the sunset if you can, make time to walk on the bike path a little bit to, its really nice!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vindensskygge
40,Iconic and touristy,"The Santa Monica pier is pretty much what you'd expect, it's what you see on the movies tv shows etc. it's made and run for tourists from bubba gump shrimp to souvenirs to the iconic Ferris wheel everything is there.. It's not something to spend a whole day at you can be in and out within an hour or soo and seen and done everything there is to do there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevenwF4804ZP
50,several times,There's two crowds today crowd and then the evening crowd the evening crowd is a little more fun sometimes they have concerts in the summer on Wednesdays but it's a good family place to go if you especially if you want to bring your kids and ride some carnival rides,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/320prestonc

There are also many rides, shops and restaurants on the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xena2542
50,You have to visit this place,While you are closer to Santa monica of course visit the pier and breath deep i loved it with surfers and buy some gifts drink some on the pier,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mammutside
40,First time here,"Even though I have lived for a few years in San Diego, I had never been to the Santa Monica pier. It was interesting but will definitely not go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaulGA
40,Iconic pier,"We were coastal cruising the west & stopped in Santa Monica. It was pretty chilly outside (being from the south anything below 60 is cold) so that was slightly uncomfortable. The pier itself was cool though! I didn't ride any of the attractions, I just walked around and checked out the different views & kiosks set up. The views are gorgeous out there. It's an iconic stop that should definitely be made by anyone passing through!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/acberrondo
50,Santa Monica Pier,"Visited the pier from the Hop on Hop off bus tour. A must see, plenty of food avail and fantastic beaches.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karinnas_11
30,Evening stroll along SM Pier,"No doubt about it, The Pier is looking a little tired but for some family fun and glorious night time views, this is a nice place for an evening stroll.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ponatahi
50,Fun place to visit,It is a very nostalgic place to go. Funner when the kids were younger. It can get crowded so I try to go on Thursdays and Fridays and avoid the weekend. Love eating at Bubba Gumps even though the food is average. The view from the pier is amazing and the beach is the best in the USA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Markjmco
40,Quick Stop,"I stopped briefly at Santa Monica Pier as I was about to start a roadtrip. The pier is clean and there's a lot of live local artist that sing and do small performances. There's a few places to eat and as you look back towards the street, you see the mountains neighboring the ocean and it's truly beautiful. It's just a simple pier, but the atmosphere feels very nice. The parking was $6.00, and if I were to suggest something, I'd say to park here and rent a bike to take to Venice Beach to have ease of parking and a quick adventure. Would stop here again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Racheyyyy
30,"Ok, not much to do","The pier itself is ok just like any other pier with rides, fairy floss and carnival games. The kids will love it. Your wallet won't. Lots of buskers singing and making ballon animals. Ocean views are nice. Venice beach about 15 minutes up the beach. Again famous for its name. The pier is Good for an hour walk around. Head up to Santa Monica itself now that's worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fisher1962
50,"""FUN TIME FOR ALL"" Santa Monica and the Santa Monica Pier.","Santa Monica is definitely a spot to be saved on your ""Bucket List"" of things to do on your travels along the Pacific Coast. About 20 miles from downtown Los Angeles, Santa Monica is just like you've traveled to a beautiful far off resort somewhere on an exotic, tropical island. Yes, it's kind-of touristy but that's just what a far off island would be like, take Oahu, which is a good example. Santa Monica is a ""laid-back"" trendy beach town with loads of shopping on the 3rd street Promenade as well as the ""Santa Monica Place"" which is an outdoor sunny shopping Mall. Nice classy stores to shop in and ""browse"" around in. It also has several fine eating establishments on the second level where the restaurants not only vary in price but you have a wide array of food to choose from. Ahhhh yes, what a way to spend a sunny lazy afternoon with so much shopping to do!The Santa Monica Pier, which is just a short jaunt from the ""Santa Monica Place"" and the ""Third Street Promenade"" it shares a panoramic view of the Pacific Ocean where one can choose from an assortment of restauants that reside on the pier. And If you are a connoisseur of seafood, BUBBA GUMPS' SHRIMP COMPANY has the best seafood gumbal that ""SHAKES RATTLES and ROLLS"" to the sounds of the crashing waves along the sand. Also on the pier is ""Ocean Park"" an amusement park for the kids and ""ADULT-KIDS"". Carneval types of games as well as rides that are fun for those who likes a little ""exhilaration"" high above the pacific ocean! Those that are less enthusiastic over the ""Scary Rides"" will like the slower pace of a beautiful restored carousel.Yes... you must visit Santa Monica if you come to California and for those who live in California who haven't been to Santa Monica for a while, Santa Monica has changed a lot and you need to re-visit it as well!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrianL368
50,A must visit,"Before entering LA from the North, stop off here for a fun filled few hours. Beautiful beach, plenty of places to eat",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atp1006
40,Touristy fun!,"I'm not one to do lots of ""touristy"" things when I travel, but this was really fun. Although crowded, there are great views AND lots of Route 66 stuff (it ends nearby). Beaches on either side also have a paved path for walking, and it's just a few blocks into Santa Monica. Well worth an hour or two. Parking next door, but not cheap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marftrip
40,Back on the pier🏄🏾,"For me, coming to LA means going to the Santa Monica Pier. Beautiful beach, beautiful day, great way to take in the sights!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/surfdesign
40,Worth to visit once,"It is part of Santa Monica's scenery so it is worth it to visit once. But in the end it is only a wheel, no need to come several times, it's enough to have it around on pictures",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcvdinhdo
50,Traditional pier end of route 66,"Loved it. Very traditional old pier steeped with history. It has an old rollercoaster and ferris wheel, that lights up the skyline at night. Old wooden pier (the beams do not show the water below. I know some people are afraid of that) with amusements and a restaurant/bar at the end. We spent a couple of hours here which was enough but could easily have stayed longer. It's free to go on the pier.It has a lovely indoor carousel at the entrance. I found a Zoltar machine (from the movie ""big""). Bubba Gump Shrimp clothing is here too. This pier is the end of the line for route 66.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndyHouse
20,More nostalgia than pleasure,"very underwhelmed at this experience. all the standard stuff, over priced poor rides, ferry wheel and slots. if you want to say you've done it go ahead but don't get too excited. Zoltar machines and Bubba Gump shop hint at enough memory of Tom Hanks but apart from that, save yourself a walk",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/17stevej
40,Come at night to see the led ferries wheel,"For a change of scenery, come at night to beat the day crowd. The pier lights up and the pace slows to a more relaxing atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Donaldinc

50,best beach,"I was there during a week-end in LA and this was the best part of the trip! The beach is huge, the sand is soft and ""gold"" and the ocean is amazing even though you can find some seaweeds. Furthermore there's a bridge just on the ocean and some rollercoasters and bars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertalora
30,Santa Monica Pier,"Spectacular view of Pacific sunsets. There are rides on the pier for kids. Drawbacks are that it is very touristy and homeless people everywhere. If you're in the area I suppose it's a must see, but I'm certain there are more serene beach locations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/966jona

50,A pier into the Ocean,"I was in Santa Monica on business and took time to visit the pier for an evening meal and a beer. It's quite atmospheric and reaches out into the sea, so has a lot of different attractions, not least the very talented buskers who pitch up regularly. We had dinner and a beer which were God value for us hard pressed Euro currency travelers. Well worth a visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShaunS417
40,Spend an evening,"It has a kind of charm attached to it that can be experienced only when you visit the place. The crowd is beautiful. Lots of places to eat sit and unwind. Infact during my stay of 2 days on LA, this was one of the places I loved the most.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sriramagrawal

40,Santa Monica Pier,"I was cruising around Santa Monica and came accidentally down to this area. It was early sunday morning and there was police just going to close the pier. They said someone made a big mess there during saturday and they had to close it for cleaning. They kindly let us walk to the end of it and then quickly back. I didn't see anything unordinary though but have to be thankful for the kind policemen.Apart from that unfortunate thing, this place has nice ocean view. I would definately go back there next time I'm in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Timo_FIN76
40,Nice rides!,"Me and my cousin and our family went for a short one hour trip to the pier, it was crowded, (it was close to Thanksgiving, so we knew it would be packed) the rides are nice, wish some of them were longer, the shopping was great, and we had a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hopes316
30,It's a Pier! Go on a Weekday. Avoid Holiday Weekends.,"Been before and it's a lovely place to visit. We travelled from Minneapolis to visit family for Thanksgiving and stopped in at the Pier. It was very packed. Our daughter and her cousin were able to ride the coaster without an exhausting wait, so that was good. We've been several other times, but Saturday after Thanksgiving...not a great idea. However, stthad fun for the hour we could handle the crowd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/353shannanl
40,An L.A. Experience,"Something for everyone; Beach swimming, amusement rides, music and restaurants. The really young ones will love the beach and the teenagers will dig the amusement park. Music performers line the port and there are many restaurants to choose from. Worth a long afternoon visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HammerJr
50,Awesome views,"I've never been to the pier and I am now kicking myself for not coming sooner. Parking was simple, right on the pier $10 for the whole day. The beach was easily accessible with a great walkway if you don't want sand in your shoes. The pier itself has a nice little amusement park that can be done in a few hours and if you subscribe for coupons not too expensive. The food was normal stuff but pricey. The entertainment was interesting. The view at the end of the pier was worth the cold breeze. It was picture perfect. Great place to not spend a lot of money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeDude
40,Fun,Very fun! An evening well spent! Rides and some fun games. Had a great time walking around with my cup of coffee.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/waunderlust_forever
40,Nice walk!,"Since we live in the Midwest, far from the ocean, any chance to walk on the beach is enjoyed! Lots of little shops with touristy items , a small amusement park & a few restaurants are all on the wharf. It was cool and windy the day we were there, so not as pleasant as I am sure some days are. The Route 66 end at the end of the pier was a fun piece of trivia!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rphnd
50,Sunset views,This pier is worth walking to the end of as everyone gathers there to watch the beautiful sunsets. People fish and we also saw seals as well. Lots to do on this pier including rides. Stay until dark as the Ferris wheel lights up with such pretty colours and patterns and is worth staying for. Lovely food as well at the Mexican restaurant at the end of the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nomad5522
40,Neat attraction,"The pier is a nice place to spend some time. There's a small amusement park and a few restaurants. Views of the Pacific are great. Unless you're dining there or doing the amusement park rides, it's probably an hour long visit, more or less.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkM354
50,"One of those places you need to see, just because it's there.","I have so many great memories going to the Santa Monica Pier. As a teenager in the summertime, to the time I went with friends when I was 35 years old. the attraction for the crowd, the noise and of course the ocean air is something everyone has deep within them",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deb4life
50,Ferris Wheel!,"Awesome! I haven't been on a ferris wheel in years!!! This was so worth it! I did this on my very first day within 2 hours of being here... I stayed at a hotel on the beach right next to the pier, so it was easily accessible!Just one of those things that I can scratch off my bucket list!I totally recommend checking out the pier!!If you don't have kids, there really isn't much to do... we went on the ferris wheel and then left",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leahr783

40,A Lot Going On,"This place is a place where things are happening. Everything seems to be here. Fishing, beach, pier, amusement park, aquarium, tons of first class shopping, bike rentals, and miles of walking paths along the coast. There are lots of homeless people there. This is a place that you can mingle with the most wealthy or the most poor. Whatever your looking for, this place has it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hestony

50,A must stop!,"Santa Monica is filled with trend setters, entrepreneurs, tourists, and drifters... so quite a variety to be a part of or speculate upon.The ritzy vibe of Santa Monica Place is nice... then if you keep walking around, you can find the not so glamorous parts... Its all good, I always feel safe though.Anyways, the Pier is so cool, such a fun spot to check out. A+. Also, its been in numerous movies, so you just have to check it out to feel the vibes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kalograms
50,Exactly what I expected!,"I grew up in Colorado, and the great California attractions seems like just something you see on tv.Well this is just like the movies and MORE!Attractions, concession stands, quirky gift shops, great restaurants and breathtaking pacific ocean views.I definitely recommend tourist to take the time to schedule the pier as one of their destinations. Worth all the traveling! Great California weather in late fall/ almost winter is the cherry on top!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoelSmitty
40,Love this place...,Ever since I first visited LA back in 1990 this place has stuck in my mind. Always a pleasure to return and hang out. This year was no exception as my partner had never been here and it was a pleasure showing her around. We walked along between the Pier and Venice beach many a time day and night.Can't wait to return.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daveyoungone1
50,Great views,Great views of the ocean and surrounding areas. Visit at night also to view the pier lit up. Saw seals playing right off the pier where fishermen were fishing off the edge.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ncuff01
40,Crowded Sunday,We think it was a bit expensive for the offer but the Pier was a nice place to spend the Sunday afternoon with the kids. The food options are so-so,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JorgePerezG
40,Comeback to Santa Monica!,This pier never ceases to amaze. Its vibrant and lively to be at. There was so much activity and the crowd was having a good time.The seagulls and pigeons are also part of the scenery along with the hometown artists who tend to provide free entertainment. The rides are good too and so is the small but entertaining game stall area.The beach is massive for someone from where I come and the water was pretty cold. My 2 year old had a brilliant time of it.Would recommend anyone who is visiting LA to come here. Tip to park in the lots near the Santa Monica Plc. There are 8. First 90 mins is free. The app store is also huge.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abizerr
40,Always something going on,You can't not enjoy a stroll along the pier in Santa Monica with everything that's going on. It's a great place to people watch and take in the sounds of the eclectic buskers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tommm83
30,Old and Tired,This needs some major work by the local government...as a traveler i was very disappointed at this landmark. as a family don't waste your time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deansmallman911

40,Lovely pier!,The last time I had been to a pier was the one at pismo beach. But loved the santa monica one much better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SVC17
40,A great place to visit!,"We are visiting family for Thanksgiving and flew in through LAX.We thought about visiting before getting here and happily confirm our plans once we got situated this first morning.TripAdvisor pointed us to to Pier's website, and from there we called and confirmed details about parking - abundant right there, off PCH, on the beach level... And also atop the pier, and about the rides at Pacific Park.We went and had lunch, and walked the length a couple times. The sky was cloudless and sunny and that made for a bit do a tan while we enjoyed seeing the beach, the water, and the seagulls and pigeons.Our daughter asked the artist to write her name in a grain of rice, and the artist did an amazing job of that, and she added a heart and 'Santa Monica Pier 2015' to it before hanging it on a bracelet... The artwork is amazing... And so small I needed a macro lens on the iPhone to see all its exquisite details.We also enjoyed some racing games at the arcade before departing to visit family.We recommend visiting the Santa Monica Pier to all, whether they appreciate it as the fun end of Route 66 or not!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/78michaelv
50,Fun for all ages,"It is like visiting an small amusement park by the beach. There is always something fro everyone. A nice cool looking shirt, a souvenir, ice cream, video games, rides, the view and of course you pick the company.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissDCWilson
50,Great area of fun and food,"This famous spot is a fun place to visit. There are lots of food vendors, cafes and restaurants, as well as shops and stall holders. It is an easy walk from the public bus, as well as the Hop on Hop off bus. The big wheel is very colourful at night, and the area lights up like a fairyland after dark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelbugbitten10
40,A very cool place to spend the day.,This is a fun place and it is very close to the 3rd Street promenade. Combined the 2 make for a very fun time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1jjarecki
50,Beautiful place to be,"We loved everything about Santa Monica Pier and the beach is amazing. So much sand and so many things to look at. People doing work outs and tricks on the bars great to watch. The Pier was just so busy but exciting to be there. The rides are at a medium price, and plenty of places to eat. Well worth stopping in and having a look around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/832shaneb
40,"An icon, and priced like it","First the great: This is the classic Santa Monica Pier - the western end of I-10 and icon of so many films. With a lighted amusement park (the Ferris wheel and carousel are especially famous) over the Pacific at night, this probably comes in second (after Monterey Beach Boardwalk) as the best amusement park location on the Pacific. It's a great stop on the 20km-long beach walkway, and besides the amusement park, sports restaurants, bars, fisher-people, vendor-people, surfers and sunbathers below and all manner of humanity strolling, watching, and enjoying life above.Now the not-so good. First: don't even think of trying to park here. Yes you can (or at least could: they may closing it down). But this might be the most expensive paring lot on the planet. Park 4-5 blocks away and walk. Second: everything else is very expensive too. That beer, the burger, the Bubba-Gump shrimp all come very dearly. Location, location, location.Now the balance: it's free to enter, look around, and take some pictures with your selfie-stick. Everyone else is. Do do it if you're in the area. It is an icon. Just be prepared to spend the equivalent of a mortgage payment (at least outside of California) if you want to make a day of it here with the family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W1187RJdavidp
40,A must do for tourists,"OK, it may be classed as a tourist trap, but I can never resist walking on this pier. There is always something interesting, whether it be locals, buskers, shops or just the view. There is a fun park for kids and plenty of basic food options. Near the end of the pier is a picture display with a little history of the pier. Don't forget to also walk underneath, equally as interesting from below.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emanpee
40,A must! In LA,"Santa Monica Pier is definitely one of LA's most famous landmarks, it has become part of LA's tradition, more because of its cinematographic history than for its beauty itself. It is the end of Route 66 (it has its corresponding sign, for the perfect souvenir picture). It is also home of a Zoltan Fortune Teller arcade (based on the movie ""Big"" staring Tom Hanks) and hosts a ""Bubba - Gump"" with its own Forest Gump bench, chocolate box and shoes. In short is a nice place to walk around, remember some films, admire a ""Bay's watch"" like beach and take a look around Santa Monica's neighborhood, the Promenade is also highly recommendable. A perfect time to go is before sunset, so you will be able to see the pier at day, live a sunset over the sea and get to know the pier also at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fhurtadoc
40,Just to say I was there,The pier is just OK. I cannot see anything too spectacular about it but you cannot go to Hollywood and not go there as it is in so movies and literature. You do not need to spend too much time there but fit it in on the way to The Getty museum,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/871frankg

50,Unexpectedly impressed! Will spend more time in Santa Monica next time!,"I wanted to see the pier however visiting Santa Monica wasn't on the top of my list. We ended up visiting Venice Beach in the afternoon and enjoyed the markets and incredible sunset. At night the police come and shut everything down. There is a heavy police presence there so I wouldn't suggest going to Venice Beach at night. Once it was dark we moved on to Santa Monica and explored the pier. The pier it's self was fun but after a few rides there isn't much to do, so we had dinner at Bubba Gump's it was great, very different to anything I had had before. I saw so much in the city of Santa Monica that I would love to explore next time I go to LA. I would suggest spending about 3-4 nights there if you have the time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessicaLake
30,Pretty touristy but still fun,Beautiful beach view and entertaining. The lights of the rides at night is a classic view. Bubba Gump Shrimp House! Parking was simple on a Thursday night in November and it wasn't too busy on the pier but the restaurants were still pretty packed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jessica_Kamloops

50,Was able to catch the sun set,On the previous trips to LA I never had time to stop at the pier....my regrets. This place is beautiful. To be able to stand and watch the sun set or stand under the pier and take pictures...nothing like it. A must visit while in the LA area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/devaughn1972

50,Beautiful Sunset View,"This was the most exciting spot in the area of LA. We went around sunset and it was beautiful. Everyone at the beach is working out, taking pictures, hanging out and others riding bikes. It's a place where you can be surrounded by so many people but at the same time be aline with nature.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keren_mex
40,Neat place,"We made it to Santa Monica via the yellow route on the Starline Hop On Hop Off Tour. Had we drove, it is unlikely we would have found parking at the lots near the pier were already full (around 11am). The pier is very touristy and was quite congested when we visited. This was my first time seeing the Pacific, and there are some great spots at the end of the pier for photo ops. We didn't go on any of the rides, but we enjoyed ""people watching"" and taking in all the sights. A lot of musicians playing on the pier to make a little extra money, some that were quite talented!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worknschoolmom23
30,Nicely lit at night,"Looks nice lit up at night. There isn't much in the way of shops or restaurants on this pier. However, you can get onto the beach easily on a wood walkway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SanibelGirl6033
40,My fave spot in LA,"Every time I go to LA, I make it a point to stop over Santa Monica Pier.Whether it be day or night, I enjoy hanging out in this area. It's a nice place to spend the morning with kids. Play on the beach and watch the waves.At night, the lights are amazing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CatChoachuy
40,"Total tourist trap but you just got to do it, kids enjoyed it","Yes, the Santa Monica Pier is very touristy, but it is fun to go through the shops, ride a couple rides, have lunch, and watch the surfers. My daughters (11 & 9) loved it and wanted to stay on the pier longer but we decided to walk down the beach more instead.We got there early around 10am and had no trouble finding parking. When we left around 1:30pm though the adjacent lot was packed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bentM5812PW

50,LOVE it!,"1) I love their location - right on Sta. Monica Pier; entertainment galore!2) Food - lots of delicious seafood selection3) FANTASTIC SERVICE - they have an awesome system where you just flip the red sign ""STOP"" and in seconds, someone attends to your needs, questions or request. Restaurants should learn and adapt their terrific customer service.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosario308
30,Fun Enough,"It was a very windy day when we visited and although we enjoyed the pier, we really liked watching and participating in the athletic equipment and activities on the beach more.It's more for families with young children ready and willing to part with their money for junk food and rides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bookwormmo
40,Chilly day,Was a nice sunny day but very windy. Made it to be for a quick visit. Was nice though I can see it being packed on nice days! Had a nice walk on the huge beach. They keep it so nice and clean by the way.Some of the games and rides were not open. Not sure if that's due to the windy day b,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vav22
50,Great morning,Great relaxing morning. Beautiful sunny day just wandering around the pier. Had lunch at Bubba Gumps . Great for all ages,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y5920KVdonnat
40,A must do,Spent a day down here and really enjoyed it. Would recommend hiring a bicycle and riding down to Venice beach. Lots of food and clothes shopping around too,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ashie2013

40,Crowded,It is a cool pier with a good bit to see and do. It just gets really crowded on weekends so be prepared to dodge all the people trying to snap pics on the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paddy312

40,"Cool experience, worth the visit","My wife and I visited the Santa Monica pier while traveling through California back in March. It was relatively close to our hotel and we figured we couldn't be that close and not check it out. We visited at night while it was all lit up and it was a really fun atmosphere. Lots of activities and places to eat, but just taking in the overall sites are the big draw. We walked to the end of the pier and watched the fisherman and enjoyed looking down at the waves crashing on the beach. If you are in the area, you should certainly stop by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brockm118
50,Great View,A beautiful view of the ocean. Many restaurants and shops to stop at. You can fish from the pier. The beach is there too in case you want to swim (too cold when we were there). Above the pier is a park that is really nice to walk thru - a few statues and a great view of the ocean and pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/13Kim14
40,Sunny day attraction,"We arrived here after about 30 hours of travelling with no sleep so we were feeling pretty average. Had breakfast and then walked down the pier to check out the sights. There was a public, free yoga class going on at the end of the pier which looked pretty cool. I had a swim in the ocean before we left to check in to our hotel and it was very refreshing. Worth a look and if you can go when all the rides and stuff are going it would probably be quite fun, if not a little bit expensive but good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgief798
50,Scenic stop,"This was on our must-see list for our Cali coast road trip, and it didn't disappoint. Parking was easy-in and easy-out and was $6, which I thought was going to be more. Great views of the coast and plenty of sunshine made it a nice stop. The public bathrooms could have been cleaner, but otherwise, this is a recommended stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luvcivilwarstuff
30,Well worth a visit,"The Pier is lovely. Full of people and their kids. There are many restaurants to chose from and the view is amazing.My only complaint was how little you could do. Like, sure, you can eat and enjoy the games, but they are mostly for little kids, so it gets a little boring after a while. But it's a nice spot if you want to be lazy and enjoy the sun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AangelKataang
40,Worth the visit,This pier is a must if you are visiting Santa Monica we went in the morning before all the rides opened and it was quiet at that time but it did get very busy later in the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/93gregw
10,Don't understand the hype,Visited here on vacation with my 20 year old daughter. Don't understand why this remains a tourist attraction. It's just a long boring pier with far too many dirty bums. The view of the ocean is great and it was nice to be in a place that has been in plenty of movies. Glad I can cross it off of my bucket list. Worth a trip if you must do the typical tourist attractions,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3ofustogether
30,A friendly visit,"Loved our time at the Santa Monica Pier. Acted like tourists and enjoyed the pier.Went before our early afternoon plane and walked the pier. Saw some wildlife and caught some rays.The boys think it was great and didn't know why we didn't live closer. Local music, fun colorful locals, and even some kind of camera crew where all there for us to enjoy. Certainly not what we see at home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minnime
50,Awesome pier and amusement park,"The pier is so lively and worth a visit. We went to a walk, and then decided to stay for lunch and hit the roller coaster for a couple rounds. Really a great time had by our family and my son of 10 said it was one of his Favorite places he's ever visited just due to the cool vibe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamofvictoria
40,Well worth a visit,As we drove from the Vegas to LA on Route 66 we thought we had to visit Santa Monica! The pier is a little dated and needs a bit of TLC and the rides are a little pricey but it's well worth a visit to see! And if you can make it for sunset it's absolutely breathtaking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/385emmaf
40,Famous spot,This is where route 66 ended in the days. Great ambiance and nice place to go in the evening. We felt secure and enjoyed the amusement park at the end of the pier. An iconic place in L.A.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kimmen1
30,The End of Route 66,"The Santa Monica Pier is a typical ocean pier complete with rides, attractions and arcades for kids. You'll find people selling various items and mediocre, chain-type restaurants. I recommend walking up to Ocean to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TripsterJoe
40,Landmark of LA,This place has a great vibe and special views. What a spot for such a mixture of people and things to do. It is even the end of Route 66. Loved the setting and the atmosphere of music people and amusement.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tuldge
40,"Good trip, not much to do","I was a bit disappointed with the pier, it was very orientated towards young children. Other than a few restaurants there wasn't much to do. It is nice to relax on the beach and check out the mall across the road though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kdloop
40,""" The End of the Mother Road.....""","A must Do on any trip to LA. The Pier is an Iconic part of Califorian and American History. We visited on a weekend and the whole coastal area was packed. The beach was as wide as I have seen and the pier itself is home to Restaurants, Fun park, and vendors selling hats souvenirs etc, Buskers and Hotdog stands.The Pier is not the real attraction, but its the people that visit, that makes this place so special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rusty3350
50,Fun place to visit,We spent Halloween on the Santa Monica Pier. It was a real buzz. Lots of people dressed up as well as buskers to watch. The highlight was riding the ferris wheel watching the sunset.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElleandBee

50,So much fun!!,"Every age group will have a great time just walking the pier, shopping or riding the rides! Definitely worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephaniemC2913LP
30,Good but a little dated,"Good old style fun, but a little dated and could do with some renovation, although the oldness gives it a certain charm.Better at night than in the day when it is all light up and you cant quite see it looks like its going to fall down",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Diveboy77
30,Interesting -- but nothing spectacular!,"It was our first visit to Santa Monica. Visiting 'The Pier' was recommended as something we 'should do'. We followed the advice -- it's very much like any other tourist attraction --- restaurants, souvenir shops, arcades.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardB562

40,"Something to Experience but Not Necessarily a ""Must""","When asking people where to go when visiting Los Angeles the Santa Monica Pier always gets a mention. While one of the more exciting piers along CA's southern coast due to the amusement like rides, it is still just a pier.But being a pier you do benefit from amazing views and the occassional wildlife spotting. Seals are a frequent occurrence.Like other tourist spots the fair is expensive, so you're better off purchasing food and souvenirs just off the pier.Go to say you went. Linger for the amazing food and overall vibe. But don't go out of your way to cross town and make it an afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LiferinLondon
50,Ice Cream !,I had a few extra hours to burn in LA and I wanted to visit this famous pier. I instantly was inspired to eat ice cream on the pier......and that's what I did!The people watching is amazing as are the views of the sea and land. Go to this pier and eat ice cream!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalMogul
50,Seen it in the Movies,I have seen this place in the movies so many times so it was an awesome buzz to be there in person. Always a lot of activity happening.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bradyandkarlie
40,Love love love,The beach around the pier is my favorite in Southern California simply because of childhood memories. The pier itself is older and not as fun as it was when I was a kid.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethanne86
10,Not so exciting,Going one time might be enough. Not a big fan of this place and is kind of pricy for what u get. Didn't like it that much. I would rather take the kids another place and spend money differently.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/253simas
40,County Fair on a Pier,"There are fun rides at the Santa Monica pier, including the ferris wheel. A great place to come with kids or enjoy a flashback to your childhood. The place is really an institution and worth a visit. But, once is enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SanNic44
30,Great views -very tacky though,A walk along the pier provided great views and photo opportunities but the offerings on the pier consisted mainly off yacky tourist rubbish and low quality buskers as well as the inevitable people soliciting for cash. Didn't try the restaurant (s?) but tbe fast food outlets were not tempting. Disappointing -apart from the views,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katep994
50,The end of route 66,"But much more, a kind of myth in fact, this pier is really lovely, with musicians, painters, scupltors, just name it, the feeling is great and the place is very secure",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A6471OApaulr
50,Old School Fun,"I went with my 7 year old after dark to see the pier all lit up for night, and what a great decision! Was so beautiful and nostalgic, with the full moon and the stars. And of course, it's California so it was still very warm, we played in the sand at the beach when we needed a break from the lights and sounds of Pacific Park (the amusement park on the pier). Would SO go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJBradley74
40,just like the movies,"A place you have to visit, our family had a great morning here and returned back in the evening. We had a few drinks at Al Mare what a view and great service. Teenagers enjoyed the amusement park and aquarium then finished up at Buppa Gumps for dinner watching the sunset. Great sun sets",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nics_family
40,Fun but a little overrated,"Of course we had to visit the pier! We thought it was very nice but seeing it on tv, I was expecting more than what we saw. I guess it seems bigger on the small screen, but it is still worth a walk through to say that we did it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anneaE2209XL
40,Nice afternoon,Nice place to take a walk and enjoy the view of the beach and moutains. Don't need a lot of time to see the whole pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/954CaroD
10,Very Tacky,This is a very tacky area with same being said for the numerous souvenir shops/goods being sold here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/40s_traveller_1111
40,Fun for a visit and photos,Definitely a must do for Santa Monica but be sure to allow for the great photo opportunities at sunset and in the evening!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/760augustag
40,Quick visit,"My brother and I visited looking for touristy stuff and a bite to eat. I wasn't too thrilled by it but I was just at Mission Beach in the San Diego area a couple months ago and there really is no comparing the two. This pier has a few rides, but I'm not sure what ages would really enjoy it. There is a couple of touristy shops and kiosks, but not as many as I thought there would be. The beach was clean and parking was easy at the garage across from the police department. There were a couple of good street performers who added to the atmosphere. Overall it was a nice taste of California for my brother, but it is definitely not a place with much nightlife or even a reason to spend more than a couple of hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JustinK326
40,Worth taking a look,The day we went to the pier the wind was ridiculously strong. The Pier looks cool. Has a mini theme park with rides on it. Has a beautiful merry-go-round inside the ice cream shop at the start of the pier. Rides are only $2. Took some good pictures on the beach and Santa Monica from the pier. Sunset may be a good time to hangout there. Just too windy the day we went!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fantafox
50,GTA in Real life!,"I'll start by saying this - I'm a big GTA player. And for me, the highlight of my entire trip was going to the Santa Monica Pier. However, nothing could've ever prepared me for the real life experience I had. Everything about the place made it more interesting, vibrant, and attractive. Will go again, indefinitely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adhikari2012

50,Smell the salt water,The views off the pier of the ocean was amazingRoute 66 the end of the roadwe didn't do any of the rides it looked liked fun I'm sure the views from the Farris wheel where greatwe looked around the shop on the pier went for lunchthen we put our feet in the ocean walked in the sand great afternoon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/266tenam
50,Fun and colourful,"I walked from Venice beach down to Santa Monica pier and id highly recommend this....Arriving to the pier i was blown away by the energy and vibrant atmosphere, so many stalls and street artists, the pier is busy so keep the little ones close",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tfage
40,Nice place to visit,"The pier is a fun place to take the time to walk around and enjoy the views, the people, the atmosphere, and good food. The ""public parking"" buildings are very pricey, if you go to the pier, park directly in the piers parking area, it is the cheapest around, and puts you right by the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/salupm1
50,Fun afternoon/evening out,"After a day on the beach, the pier is a great place to relax in the evening - it is very safe with some fun food places - I would highly recommend the Malibu Veggie Burger from ""Beach Burger"" at the entrance to Pacific Park (where the roller coaster/rides are). My family voted it the best vegetarian burger ever! No contest! $6.50 +tax. Also their garlic fries are STRONG! (But amazing!) :)There's a very small aquarium under the pier which entertained us on the Sunday morning. It's not big but the staff are fantastic - very well informed and great at explaining things in a way that really captured my kids' imaginations. It was such a bargain too - $5 for adults and kids 12 and under are totally free. It only opens a few hours per day, so check opening times before you make plans.There is a carousel located near the aquarium - definitely worth a look and a go at only $2 per adult and $1 per child with an old fashioned ice cream shop located alongside. Beautiful.There's a Bubba Gump shop/restaurant which does have some specific Santa Monica Pier t-shirts and is fun to browse in.This is the end of Route 66 too so there are some fun photos to be taken by the sign on the end of the pier. There is also a good, 1980 type arcade with classics like pacman, air hockey, Zoltar and similar.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LonePineKath
30,Iconic and worth seeing,"It's INCREDIBLY BUSY on a Saturday evening. But to walk off Ocean Drive onto the pier and out to the end, past the colourfully illuminated Ferris Wheel is a treat for the eyes. Plus you get to see a sample of the eclectic mix of Californian Residents and Visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FlyBacon
40,"Avoid the overpriced ""Public Parking""","Drive onto the pier and park directly on the pier for $2/hour. Don't get scammed by the other signs for ""public parking."" One place across from the pier wanted $20! Yikes! A late lunch at the Albright ($60 for a family of four) and some selfies on the Ferris wheel (a bit overpriced at $8 per person) made for a nice albeit expensive memory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobbyLynch
40,Iconic end of Route 66,"Easily accessible with good parking facilities, the pier is a ""must visit"" for anyone driving the Pacific Coast Highway. It is the end point of Route 66 and there is plenty of memorabilia on offer, including a great photo opportunity at the end of the pier.There are a few fairground rides -the big wheel really stands out -and places to eat. A great visit all round.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigMerk
50,Great fun,Great place for a walk. Very chilled out place that is good for families. Felt very safe. There was also a Thai food festival when we were there so we ate a lot of fantastic food.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/889andrewa
40,Must see when visiting the LA area,"Visited with my boyfriend on Halloween. The first thing I noticed was how busy it was, but that's to be expected with such a landmark. It had a fun blend of people, music, food, and attractions. It also abuts the beach which was very clean and made for a fun afternoon. Definitely see it at least once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cycamps
30,"Cool,but not amazing.","The pier is pretty cool,lots of people with different activities going on. I wouldnt spend more than half an hour there though,and Santa Monica beach isnt a greart place to chill out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eoinp158
40,"Alot of Fun, Very crowded","Santa Monica Pier was on our list of places we had to visit. While we were not overwhelmed we were not disappointed. The pier has some rides, although not many, restaurants, shops and games. Fun place for kids and sits on the beach. There is tons of parking, but if it is a beach day get there early because it is hard to find. The one great thing are the sunsets over the ocean which are stunning. Nothing special about a pier with rides, but we enjoyed ourselves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scipoletta
50,Nice place to see,I enjoyed seeing the pier. We got there early and it wasn't crowded at all. The beach around the pier was huge. We found parking on the street. Plenty of place to eat. Great view from the end of the pier. Plenty of people were fishing at the end.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Heyguy74
40,GOOD FOR FAMILIES,"Landmark place, it is very nice and family oriented, but also ok to go for a walk and appreciate the beach from here if you are alone or with friends, It has some very well known commercial restaurants, if you are in Santa Monica definitely a place to go for a quick walk and maybe have a beer or dinner if you are with your family",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/latin0692

50,Loved it!,"The Pier was absolutely buzzing. Crazy busy with tourists, locals and bikers who were reaching the end of their Route 66 adventure. It really was wonderful. Plenty of eateries available, you name it, they have it. The amusement park reminded me of English Piers, colourful, happy and lively.Buskers, seals, old style cop cars - atmosphere plus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KiwiKerry53

40,Great at Night,"Visited recently and had a great night on the pier- plenty of places for food and drink, some very talented musicians busking along the pier- leaving enough space so as not to have to play over each other.It was great watching the fishermen at the end of the pier, made me jealous I didnt bring my own rod!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/157derekc

40,Worth the trip!,"My kids were dying to go ""to the edge of the Santa Monica pier"" after having performed in a production of Xanadu in NYC. The piers houses rides, shops and restaurants much like an amusement park. It sits on a beach and is very crowded. Restaurants are packed. Really enjoyed it but not sure that I would make a special trip back. A must see. Lots of parking but its tough especially on a nice beach day. Great sunset views from the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShirleyC184
50,Must see!,"Full of vibrant colors and amazing street artists. The area is well kept and cleaned up given the high number of visitors it sees in a day.

40,Nice place to explore and walk around,"Great place to spend an hour or two or more if you want to sit on the beach. Has a lot of history. We go to the Pier most times we are in LA as I love to look in the shops, listen to the various musicians who happen to be around and watch people. The Playland is fun if you have kids or are young at heart and the carousal is a must do if you have never done it before. There are various restaurants available if you want to have something to eat. Parking is plentiful and the Farmer's Market that is held on Saturdays is close by. Great fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edgm

50,End of Route 66,"Came here to complete our Route 66 trip. There's a lovely shop where if you show your passport you can get a certificate for driving Route 66.The pier itself is pretty, nice to walk to the end of the promenade and there were some seals when we went.Definitely a must, especially if you've just driven across America on the Mother Road!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mindy1001
40,Just go!,If you are a tourist just go here. See a place you've seen in dozens of movies and people watch.I'd say take half a day to stroll the pier and have dinner. Always interesting musicians.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jroberto

40,Iconic,"I was on a short business trip and had one afternoon to sightsee. Went to Santa Monica, whole area is charming and touristy.

Don't forget to take a photo at the historic end of Route 66 and with the ferris wheel as background.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mcc048
10,"Old, rundown, crowded and dirty","This place is not worth seeing. Older places can be charming, but this one just feels dirty, tacky and rundown.

50,Must go there!,"For us, the greatest way to reach the Pier was to walk there along the Pacific seashore from Venice beach. It will take you about an hour, but it's well worth the effort! Great views and great food and drinks at the original Bubba Gump!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Szomi
40,"Cute place, not as exciting as I would have expected","Its the end of the old Route 66 trail. The pier is full of a few shops, some kinda sub-par restaurants, and fast food. It was nice to say I have ""been"" but definitely not as exciting as would have expected. It does have the little theme park full of a few rides and games, that made it nice.. I recommend but don't sleep if you miss out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dackp
50,Such a lovely fun place!,This is a great pier with plenty to see and do here. There are shops on the pier and the fun fair but that doesn't open until 11. The pier is clean and fun and a must see,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoM848
50,A bit of bling on the coast,"My wife and I visited the pier over the period 22-27 Oct 2015; it has all the razz-a-mataz of the early 1900s coupled with modern day fairground rides. The was a water conference from the Agha Khan Foundation (AKF) whilst we were there, as well as numerous tourists lapping up the trinkets that could be bought, including many T-shirts and souvenirs celebrating the start of Route 66. A good picturesque landmark and well worth visiting, and a stones throw from Santa Monica, literally across the road. Use 'The Big Blue Bus' company to get you here, it's $1 on any route, with most routes going to Santa Monica. Well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ray_Finkle_9
40,Closes early,"Got to the pier around 6:30 and even though there were still a lot of people walking around the staff was closing up for 7. Kool place to walk, hangout, people watch, but check hours since they change with the seasons.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidkC5553EX

50,Wonderful place n lovely place,"It's a great place to visit. Wonderful Santa Monica beach with golden sands. Mast time, you can enjoy with ur family n friends. Do cycling there. Also the art n work on pier is must to see. Do shopping on pier specially buy the souvenir. It's great deal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/881manishk
30,Kids luved it and a must do attraction,We were visiting Santa Monica and this is an attraction that you have to visit simply to mark off the list. The kids had a great time on the rides.Songs have been written about it and movies filmed their so now we have been there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janemP5479AG
50,Sunset at Santa Monica Pier,"I traveled to Santa Monica Pier on Wednesday, October 21st for the sunset upon arrival into LAX. It was something I had always wanted to see from there. I'm happy I did it. The sunset was beautiful with the thin clouds in the distance. Full of vibrant colors while listening to a street artist play by the bleachers. The area is well kept and cleaned up given the high number of visitors it sees in a day. The Ferris Wheel and Roller coaster light up at night for amazing pictures too. An absolute must do if you're going to be in the LA area. Cab ride from LAX is $35 depending on traffic conditions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/60jakef
50,Nice large Pier,"Great pier for a stroll with your love. Many small shops and activities including a museum and a school for trapeze which is fun to watch! Also, seems to be a very popular hot dog shop at the front of the pier, but I did not find the hotdogs to be remarkable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harring10
10,Don't go after dark!!! Full of shoeless crackheads!,"Was disturbed by what we saw. Within first few minutes on the pier we were propositioned by drugged man with the question ""Eat pills?"" One of several..... Couldn't wait to leave! Expensive parking in lot for such a short trip. Visited during day once before and it was a decent, family place. Not much there, but historic place with at least one visit with your camera. The Mexican restaurant is NOT good!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/274kimberlyg
50,Unoffical End to Route 66,The main attraction in Santa Monica is the pier. Always very busy but definitely worth a visit. It is also the unofficial end to Route 66 so be sure to have your photo taken next to the sign. At the end of the pier there is a tribute to one of the most famous Route 66 personalities Rob Waldmire. The views from the pier are great. There is also an amusement arcade with some vintage games in and of course the famous fair. A trip on the Ferris wheel is well worth the money. There are many souvenir shops selling various Route 66 memorabilia and Los Angeles and California stuff too. A great place to people watch and relax.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardT216
50,A must do in Santa Monica,I came to LA for a bachelorette party and I can't imagine us leaving without visiting the pier. Lots of cute restaurants.. Make sure to snap a pic of the Classic Santa Monica pier sign and ride the Ferris wheel if you can for an amazing view. Great spot to bring kids as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsHinton

40,Nice place.,Nice to walk and people watch. Plenty of shops and food. Access to beach. Birds are a pain but soon you forget they are there. During weekday it was not crowded. Parking is ok.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0racle61
40,Must-see for tourists and locals alike!,"Beautiful views, shops, kiosks, musicians (pots and pans used as drums), guitarists, singers, artists, bicyclists, skaters, restaurants! Just strolling along the pier is a great experience. There are a lot of colorful characters and everyone is very friendly. A fun place to visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X4480PIchrisk
30,Touristy,"Well, you pretty much know what you are going to get if you come here. It's a really touristy place. After you're done walking around a bit, head away and go find a nice bar or restaurant away from the crowds and enjoy the area",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dns65
40,Nice by the beach.,"We took the 1hr local bus trip to here from our hotel in Hollywood. Local bus only $2.50 each. Beautiful view and an iconic place BUT some aspects, like the arcade are looking very old and dirty. We only needed to spend 2 hrs there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicoleL271
40,Fun for kids and adults alike,Walked across from the promenade.Beautiful sunny day. Lots of people about.Fun rides available along with options for F&B.You can also take some handy photos with great backdrop views.Well recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tancsyd
30,Good spot to hang out but too busy,Was here on a business trip and this was the first stop getting off the airplane. Of course it was too crowded and hard to find a parking spot. They did put in a lot more parking spaces in the shopping mall close by.The pier is nice but it's not that great. There's a ferris wheel and some street artists. We walked around for a little bit but there wasn't much else to do there. The beach is huge but you can see the smog... even at the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/422hungt
40,A Great Place to Stroll,"If you are here escaping a Canadian winter, this is a lovely place to walk and relax. There are lots of 'beach people' in the area, so best to go here during the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trevor022
40,Grate outing,Great for all ages. Rides for children . Food and beautiful ocean view. Parking is $12. IF you are disabled no parking fee. A long walk to Venice Beach about 6.00 miles but great view and side walks divided for walkers and bikers skaters ect. Makes it saver for all. If you get tired there is a metro car that is free to take you back to the pier. Just ask sidewalk benders or security. Seats 5.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jayneecaruso
40,Day trip,I loved it here. There are plenty of parking around but in town some give first 2hrs free and its a pleasant walk to the pier. Lovely views acrross to Malibu.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jamie5gig
40,Energetic atmosphere,"The Pier is a one of a kind very interesting place with many different things to do. Part amusement park, part shopping at vendors on the pier, part eating snacks/fast food, part seeing the ocean and birds plus there is a small aquarium. Lots of families there. A fun atmosphere",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lrising
50,Iconic,"Watching the sunset here on the last night of our holiday is a moment I will never forget.

50,Absolutely LOVE this place,"We love visiting this place, my kids love to hire bikes and ride along the beach. The weather was pretty terrible, but it was still a nice hot day. The pier is old but it has a nice twist to it. The rides are great fun, good to go when the crowds aren't huge. Food is great, we visit all the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leannawrighty78
50,Fun. Beautiful. Lively.,"We love the Santa Monica Pier. It's a fun, lively and entertaining setting. Lots of people, but that is to be expected. A variety of food vendor options (pier food... hot dogs, hamburgers, ice cream, etc.). When the sun goes down it's a beautiful setting with all of the rides lit up and the water splashing against the pier. Fun to walk up and down, shop, listen to music or just sit there on the bench enjoying the view. The beach is gorgeous!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/629brookeb
30,"Pier was okay, the ocean was disgusting!","The pier is an average tourist attraction and super busy with people. All of Santa Monica is super busy with people, though.The ocean is extremely dirty in this area and the water was a disgusting green colour and the foam that comes off the ocean onto the sand was this horrible green colour and it smelled quite bad. Yuck. I could not believe people were actually in the water.Not a whole lot to see at the pier - some restaurants, vendors, kiddie rides, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BnJJ
50,"Lovely, old fashioned pier with modern twists",Much enjoyed the pleasant stroll in the sun with much-needed minor breeze for relief.Plenty to see and sample too,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidG897
40,Very Nice Pier / Beach with stuff to do for Kids,This place was very good to have lots of food to eat and also enjoy the kiddie rides on the pier and go to the beach for a swim,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/53lakshmanr
40,Must do in Santa Monica area,"We visited on a weekend and the pier gets mega busy, but in someways this is an advantage because it gives a real buzz to the place. If you don't get too bumped it is enjoyable!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrB876
10,What expect from a pier,"Absolutely no fun. Difficult to find good food. Dirty and without no real attraction. For me, a complete disappointment",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PFelipe
30,Nice for a walk,A classic to walk on. Rather crowded but fun for the kids. The rides are not that expensive. The restaurants are rather expensive and poor quality,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dietwee
50,Like a movie,This place is something youd see from a movie. it is so spot on to what my expectations were. Went on a thursday and it was pretty dead so when we brought rollercoaster tickets they let us ride again for free. Staff are helpful and friendly. Would recommend this place 100%,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maddisonb108
50,Real California history. A must see!,Lots of reasonable parking and good food right on the pier. Great photo opportunities from the ferris wheel. Lots of vendors and good entertainment. Just a great place to find complete relaxation. Its nice to be able to stroll down such a historic structure! Truly a must see if in southern CA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billmoffatt
40,Worth a visit,"The Santa Monica Pier is one iconic location of LA. Further to the rollercoaster and the Ferris wheel, the rest is unnecessary. But it is a visit to pay on your first trip to LA, of course. Parking near Santa Monica Pier can be challenging (or just expensive).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jac-and-Jek
40,Great destination,"Bring your family, your love, and spend a leisure day here. You can't say you've lived, or visited the LA area without visiting the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/834emada
40,"Great,but not on a weekend!","We first visited on a weekend. The pier was very busy which made it impossible to enjoy. We went back on a Monday which was so much better. All the attractions and shops were still open and we were actually able to stroll along and take everything in rather than constantly try to fight our way through crowds.We took the bus to the pier and we were glad we did as we saw a sign saying parking was $12. There was an amusement park on the pier with basic fairground rides that looked well maintained. There were also lots of souvenir shops and restaurants.The iconic ""End of Route 66"" sign was here and like most people we had our photo taken by it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pip-F1
50,Charming!,"Yes I know it's a bit outdated, quirky at some points, with those old fashioned game halls and photo salesmen, but that's exactly why you shouldn't miss out on this charming spot in bustling LA. Great beach vistas at the far end of the pier, where, if you're lucky, the old man in red will play golden oldies on his guitar.. What else?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kuisch
20,Pretty grim really,Nice day- warm late spring dayNot overcrowdedThe area is nothing special but I suppose you have to see itVenice beach is a bit cheap and nasty- the canals are so-soWe hired bikes which made it enjoyable,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X5257YCthom
40,Fun place to visit for the attraction of it,"Went to Santa Monica Pier with the family because my wife said they had to experience it once in their life. Honestly, it was fun walking the pier and seeing the sights, but I don't think it was a do-again. There is only so many times you can see someone playing music, or buying gifts, or ride some rides. It was a fun time, don't get me wrong. Just don't expect to spend all day here, because you will be broke and bored. Also, if you like buying shirts, don't expect to get lucky if you are larger than an XL. None of the shops on the pier carry anything bigger than an XL, even in a hoody. I like hoodies that are 3X or 4X, so I can wrap myself in them. No luck. The traffic was packed on the pier, but it was still a unique experience that my kids were glad to have been to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SomethingMoreInLife
50,Fantastic!,"We were at the Santa Monica Pier on Sunday, September 27, 2015 during the eclipse. While there we rode the Pacific Wheel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/108rpg

50,The heart of California,"The Santa Monica pier is a beautiful place. I've been before and it's always exciting to go back. The pier is always busy with entertainers, games, rides and laughter. Take in the scenery and enjoy some ice cream. Take note...single riders are not allowed on the ferris wheel.Beyond the pier you can find great restaurants and shopping on the promenade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/qeenreen
50,Another tick off my bucket list,Missed this back in 2010 and finally made it during a 9 hour lay over. So pleased. Great place to contemplate life while peering over the expanse of the ocean. Plenty of food choices if required. Lovely spot!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mareelcooper
40,Great Entertainment!,"Definelty something to see! Busy, and fun.The Ferris wheel is most interesting, because it is run on solar energy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CatherineF350

40,Fun to visit,"Since we went in October, it wasn't busy and we were able to park on the boardwalk parking area. The parking was only $3.00 for an hour, which was more than enough time to walk the pier, take photos etc. Yes it's pretty much a tourist trap, but still neat to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2Tig
50,End of Route 66. Pacific Ocean. Nice views,"One of the things you gotta do when you visit. After all it is the end of Route 66. Worth a walk to the end. Carousel is fun for kids. The Pacific Park rides are lackluster with the exception of the ferris wheel. Aquarium is tiny and probably interesting only to the under 5 crowd. Mostly chain restaurants, best local place to eat is Duke's Surf Cafe [burgers, chili fries, beer] under the carousel on the strand. Great views at the Mexican joint on the end, food is mediocre margaritas good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimo213

50,SANTA MONICA PIER,"The pier in Santa Monica is a great place for fun near the beach. There are a number of shops, rides, and restaurants on the pier. There is even an interesting shop at the very end of the pier. The pier can be very crowded on weekends and holidays and for its concert series. You can also visit the beach adjacent to pier and make a whole day of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/494samuelm

50,Santa Monica pier,Lots of people watching. The views are great! Make sure to walk all the way to the end and also up the steps to the highest point. What a nice view of the bay! Take time to ride at least one ride. The souvenir photos are fun too!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vegaschick2014
40,Fun tourist trap,"We had plans to meet up with family near 3rd Street Promenade, so we decided to spend our day on the pier and beach. The pier is a fun little tourist trap. I always enjoy walking down piers and this one has plenty to see. They have rides, an arcade, restaurants aplenty, and of course souvenir shops. The rides were overpriced for us, but could be fun if you bought an all day pass. This is a fun quick stop if you are already in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshleySchulte
40,Fun little tourist trap,"We visited the pier while in the area and had a good time. It's a tourist trap with lots of little shops to get your fill of all the Route 66 memorabilia and LA apparel you want, but also had the carnival rides and a variety of restaurants to enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travisschulte
30,A little dated.,We were a bit disappointed as we thought that the pier would be different. Very touristy and tacky. Views were great. The sign stating that it was the end of Route 66 is the only thing worth seeing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4444Anna4444
30,Interesting,We visited the pier to see the 'Route 66 End of Trail' sign which was good as we'd just completed the drive from Chicago. Otherwise it's just OK with what you might expect from a seaside pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frank19452015
40,Old but fun,Our family spent the day here and although it is old and run down we feel it is a must see. The arcade is fun for kids but super dirty...the view from the pier is beautiful and there is a lot to do with restaurants and the amusement park and beach. Our daughter loved it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnieTigers
30,Very big and touristy,Great view. Kids enjoyed the amusement park but they were shutting rides early which was annoying. Nice views,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sallyd110

50,A gorgeous place to watch the sun set.,"I love Santa Monica pier, it is worth visiting after a full day of being a tourist this is a place you can unwind. The sunsets are not to be missed here! Rt.66 ends here and at the very end of the pier is the ""Last Stop Shop"" the final store on Rt.66. A fun place full of history. There is something for everyone-a small amusement park for the kids to include an old carousel. An aquarium is also right here at the pier. Lots of places to eat and things to do. Plenty of gift shops and the beach is just a few steps away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BubbaSmiley
50,FIrst time being on the west coast,We were in town for the weekend for a business trip and I Have never been to the pacific ocean. Going to the Santa Monica Pier is a must do for everyone.

30,Back Porch Cinema at the Pier - No Movie,"We love the pier. The pier gets 5 stars, but we went to their first night movie last Friday, and they couldn't ever get the projector to work... at least not while we were there. For a movie that was supposed to start at 7-ish... and we left at 8:20PM... well, we were disappointed. We really wanted to see Big Hero 6 which was slated to show. I don't know if they ever got it going, and if not, whether they will show the movie another time, but we were disappointed. Overall it was still a fun night, though. We love the Pier!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaJeyDavis
50,Great fun :),"The pier is great for all ages, there are some really fun rides at pretty good prices. And an awesome wheel with a great view of Santa Monica!

50,This pier is amazing! Great time and place to be with the family.,"We've never been here so decided to check it out on our trip to LA. And we are very glad we did. The views from the Ferris wheel are breath taking and the atmosphere is great.Quick tip- place is packed so be patient and keep a close eye on the little ones. Rides can be pricey but if you're riding them all multiple times then get the unlimited pass. The walk to Venice Beach sounds long however it's a beautiful walk, highly recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jjbgreenroyd
30,Too many people; not enough fun,"I've been here several times and every time I visit I notice an increase in people. There are far too many people on the pier to have an enjoyable time, especially on the weekends. To get a hot dog, I had to wait in line for 10 minutes. The restaraunts are overpricedand and the amusement park offers boring rides for a hefty price. If you've never been here before then I guess I could understand coming here, but it's just a tourist trap with little originality.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gregoryu874

30,I'd rather go North to the Beach,"I had to see it. I'd only seen it from a distance, at night, so I had to see the Santa Monica Pier. I'd much rather go to Monterey, Carmel, or Santa Cruz, but I'm glad I at least got to see and walk the Santa Monica Pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dbrgdmn
40,Iconic and eclectic; usually crowded but rarely dull,"The world-famous Santa Monica Pier is a Southern California landmark that offers food, fun, entertainment, rides, and activities to its visitors. Seeing its beautiful, iconic, multi-colored neon sign at night is a must-see right up there with the HOLLYWOOD sign and Grumman's Chinese Theater. The nice thing about the pier is you can stroll to the end and back in well under an hour or you can spend an entire afternoon or evening on it by dining, riding some rides, watching the entertainers, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/divisiblebyzero

And in the afternoon you can walk the pier while seeing the dusk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eapelaez80
40,Go at Sunset,We visited Santa Monica in winter - which meant that several of the stalls and rides were closed which was unfortunate. Check what is open before you go. We were able to ride the ferris wheel though and that was great. We went just before sunset and so got a view of the Cali coast during daylight and then took a few more rides as the sun was setting - made for some great photos and views. It is an iconic location and while in some ways it is not exactly spectacular - we were still pleased to have visited it and to have had this experience. Some great phosot son the boardwalk too as the sun was setting in the west over the water.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travellers012
40,A Must Do!,"If you're looking for a day/night event when in the area--this is highly recommended! Check out the operating hours online first if you plan to ride (we got there late on a Thursday and they were already shut down)! Surf & souvenir shops, food (fast food to fine dining), kiosks, artists, musicians, and romance! This pier has it all! A bit of a bumpy ride for someone in a wheelchair, stroller, or walker, but it is doable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/celinap
50,Loved this place,"The pace is slow, the sights are great, the sun is shining. This all makes the pier a nice place to visit.There are quite a few spots to eat, drink, and sit. Buskers improve the atmosphere and add a little music to your step.The Ferris wheel is definitely worthwhile getting on. $8 a person and you get the best seats on the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P6219WTmichaelh
50,Nice,I enjoyed my few hours at the pier. The beach was nice and the water was pretty. It was neat to see the rollercoaster and rides. The6 had a few shops and restaurants.

40,Fun to go to if you haven't been,"Santa Monica Pier is run to go to if you've never been. Once you go, you can check it off your list and never go again, but you've got to go once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5starhippychick
50,Great people watching spot,The pier is a great place to people watch and enjoy a ride on the roller coaster. Not a lot of good food choices on the pier. Most places are over priced with mediocre food. Grab a cheese dog from hot dog on a stick for a snack. Venice is a short walk away with more dining options.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tdubaustin
40,Lots of fun!,"The first beach we visited was Santa Monica Pier. It had so much to offer – the historical carousel, the aquarium, the arcade, the pacific park with a Ferris wheel and roller coaster, and plenty of restaurants and bars to choose from. There was ample parking available for a very reasonable price; we only paid $2 for two hours. What made it even more convenient was that parking can be reserved in advance at discounted rates. Worth the visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsHospitality
