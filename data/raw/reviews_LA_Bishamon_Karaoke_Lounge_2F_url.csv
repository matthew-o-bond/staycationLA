50,Sushi and entertainment,The sushi is very good and chef will make any requests! The Sapporo comes in the large size also so it's easy to split a beer and have more time to eat endless rolls... Dynamite roll is woohoo,C4-421
10,Dud,Heard great things about this place. We were seated and waited 10 minutes for menus even though the place was semi empty. We were ready to order when the waiter took the order from a family who arrived well after we did. We got up and left. Will never return.,Gilbert S
