50,Date night,Was so happy we choose Cinepolis. It looked like they recently got new seats. I'm not a 100% sure. But the last time I was there the seats were looking old and worn out. I had stopped going there cause the seat were looking so bad and the tickets were so expensive for worn out bad looking seats. I was happy to see how clean the theater looked. Will be back,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/939beverlyk
50,Pampering experience,"Went by chance, did not really planned it and what a nice surprise.Welcoming staff, exceedingly good seats (comfortable and discreet), good choice of food and drinks and served at your seat.Nice!Parking and venue are also very good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MatCerri
50,Cinepolis is a real treat!,"Cinepolis Theater in Westlake Village La Promenade is a real treat! You can buy the tickets & pick out your reserved seats on line for a small fee!The Seats are self reclining & different settings for your movie watching needs! There is cocktail/beverage service with a menu to order a great selections of food! We frequent Cinepolis in Westlake Village, Ca! The only way to see a movie in a theater these days!Love it, Love it!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CathieP_12
30,Average experience.,The seats are big and recline but I always find the serving of food during the movie a distraction. We ate before we arrived so I cannot comment on the food quality. But a bottle of water is $6.50! The placement was clean and easy to find. They also have a full bar.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Live-n-theMoment7
50,Loved how they serve to your seat,Visiting from Vegas and came here w a friend. I love how you choose your food and they serve it to your seat. The concept at first I thought would be annoying ppl walking in front of you but it really wasn’t bad. The servers are quick and don’t interrupt. The menu was quite big! Had plenty of vegetarian and gluten free opinions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlaytimewithMiss_T_e

50,Instead of Your Family Room,"If you'd like to see a movie that you can't stream at home but you hate the stress of going to a regular theatre and wondering if your view will be obstructed, the seats comfy, if you have time to eat before or after the viewing then this theatre is a great option. Additionally the staff is polite and helpful. I have been here several times and most recently with a handicapped relative. Seat accessibility and ease of entering and exiting the theatre was really easy. The only concern is finding parking on weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelwench2013
10,Very Bad Christmas Day experience,"We have been going to this location for years. But the experience we had on Christmas was so terrible, we won’t be going back. We sat down and proceed to order our food and drinks. After an hour not even getting our drinks, we complained to the Manager. The Manager seemed really not to care and told us she would check on it. Another half hour went by and still no food or drinks! Another complaint to the Manager, and five minutes later our food comes cold and finally our drinks. We will never go back !!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rickmartins

Not only can you watch the movie in super comfortable seats and enjoy great service, but you can do so while dining on fantastic food! That was a huge surprise! So be prepared for some tasty dishes! We especially loved the beef soft tacos (they give you 3!) and the Caesar Salad. Definitely not your average movie food or theatre!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pelope57

50,Cinépolis is better than any light you can see from an Arc,"I always have a great experience at Cinépolis! The Customer Service gets 5 Stars, The Cooks Waiters And Waitresses And bussers all get 5 Stars! The Movie theatre is better than Arc Light, Regal Cinemas, And Studio Movie Grill by a big margin! And if you enjoy seeing Celebrities out in public, I’ve seen many at Cinépolis",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JonnyVegas45
50,VIP Movie-going can be had without breaking the bank,Usually pricey but weekday afternoons offer Happy Hour pricing for food and drinks in the bar before a movie- even a bottle of wine is 40% off and can be had for under $25! Just take the bottle into the movie with you. Matinee tickets can be $10 or less weekdays after 3:30 so a visit here doesn't have to cost any more than lesser places.

50,Luxury Cinema Experience,"My go-to cinema is the Regal at the Janss Marketplace but friends wanted to go to Cineoplis.It is a better experience because you get things like waiter service at your seat etc. but I don't think it is worth the premium pricing.The Regal has reclining seats and you can go and get your own food.But... this is a very nice cinematic experience and if you want to experience some bells and whistles then this is a place to definitely consider.I am giving this cinema a 5/5 because there is nothing to fault it over. You pay for hat you get, to watch a film at a luxury level.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickwarrilow
50,Great place to see movies,"We have come here many times. Always enjoyed the environment and the people who work there.The food is tasty and the service is great.We just saw The Greatest Showman.It is interesting that the critics apparently don’t have taste. Sounds like the critic in the movie.I LOVED it. It was uplifting and the acting was brilliant.The dancing and performances were exceptional.The young man Steven, who sold us our tickets said he has seen it seven times. That just means I have six to catch up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeDubiecki

50,The force is strong here,"Went and checked out Last Jedi with the family. This place is great! Seats are comfy and recline back. Call button for waiters. My wife and I enjoyed the Ultimate burger. Got a bacon infused Bloody Mary, but it was way over the top with tabasco sauce. Had to send it back. Sweet potato fries are great. Great venue to watch a movie. Try em out!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Signsofthejoker
50,An elevated level.,"A classic date night with ones' wife or girlfriend or ones' husband or boyfriend has been dinner and a movie. Cinepolis has provided the perfect venue for both to be enjoyed at an elevated level. From the immensely comfortable leather, electric adjusting chairs to cocktails and food available to order by pushing ones' ask for service button this theater has improved the ""going to the movies"" night to something memorable. It can be addictive and it is not inexpensive, but considering food and drink elsewhere would not be as much fun, certainly lessens the expense.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dichiacj
10,Stay Away From This Clip Joint,"Where to begin. They advertise luxury recliner seats in locations you choose yourself (online). However, on a recent visit, one of our seats was broken (reclining mechanism didn’t function), and the “manager” offered us seats in the first row all the way to the side of the theater. Moreover, it was plain to see that the seats hadn’t been cleaned and were encrusted with food and popcorn grease. I explained to the manager that these seats were not purchased for a reason — they were completely unacceptable. I asked for a refund, but the manager declined my request. So, we left the theater before the movie began having paid for tickets we didn’t use. As a general matter, the admission prices are ridiculously high only to be eclipsed by the prices of the across-the-board lousy food. The patrons who frequent this place go to eat, talk, and generally make a commotion rather than quietly see a movie. The management encourages this outlandish behavior by not enforcing basic rules of theater etiquette. I’ve never seen so much unabated cell phone usage in a theater. Throughout the movie, waiters are constantly crossing in front of patrons taking orders and delivering food, thereby adding to the noise and obscuring views. Then, 10 minutes before the end of the movie (generally at a critical moment in the film) the waiters appear again, this time to settle food bills. If you’re like most people, and want to see a movie without constantly being disturbed, this is not the place. Do yourself a favor and go to one of the many nice theaters located in the Thousand Oaks area. Cinépolis — Westlake Village should be avoided at all costs. It’s horrible, absolutely horrible!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garyg806
50,Cine-fabulous!!,"My husband is a creature of habit, a slow adapter. When Cinepolis first opened I wanted to take him there for months but he wasn't interested, too expensive, not his style. Finally we had a free movie screening and he understood the concept! From that day on, it is the only theatre, he will go to in the Conejo Valley. If it's not at Cinepolis, he won't go see a movie!! The theaters are small with the most comfortable seats you can imagine. Great date night choice. If you live here or are in the area - go!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/junetalks

30,Slow brewed Coca Cola,"Never start off by telling your customer ""you're sorry things are taking so long, we are just really slammed."" I watched the servers running around our theatre trying to keep up with the service lights while the runners would be casually bringing out one or two mixed drinks at a time. It took about 10 minutes after we got our food to get a coke...about 25 minutes total...for a coke. Premium prices warrant premium service. Yes the seats are great, the little lights are great and my ""ultimate burger"" was great. Even the movie we saw was great ..right up until i had to leave the theatre to find out how long it takes to make a coke. Fries were about a 2...cool and soggy. Studio Movie Grill service is much much better ...I wouldn't go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/132toddn
50,My Fav,This is my Favorite theaters. The seats are very comfortable. Love the lights by each chair. Each theater is small not this large crowed room. It is a bit pricy.Not that much more. It is well worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/939beverlyk

30,Not worth the high prices,Over-rated for sure. So many other theaters with reclining chairs now....the serving of food during the movie only acts as a distraction.I prefer the Regency theater at Janss.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gamyleigh
40,"Great Movie Theatre, Okay Food","This movie theatre is the finest you'll fine in Ventura County, if not all of Los Angeles. Their reclining chairs and service are fantastic -- a server will be at your seat with the simple pressing of a button. The theatre is also very well designed with luxurious amenities and surroundings anywhere you look. However, my one criticism of the place is that their food has gone downhill ever since opening. I have been going to Cinepolis for over three years now, and it's sad to see that this part of the movie-going experience has been reduced to mediocrity. Don't get me wrong, their popcorn is still amazing, but their entrees, such as their pizza, sliders, and steak, all have no taste. Furthermore, they have added sushi to their menu which is just awful and also doesn't seem like food meant for a movie theatre. Honestly, I'd try to eat somewhere else before, and then just snack on their more lite options while watching the movie.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yelp_is_better

50,The best movie experience anywhere!!!,"My wife and I don't go to too many movies (that's Hollywood's fault) but when we do, this is the only theater we go to. Buying your tickets online is a snap and the most convenient way to get the exact seats that you want. Speaking of seats...OMG...they just don't get more comfortable; however, be cautious because if your the least bit tired, you will struggle to not fall asleep. The service is exceptional and the entire staff is very professional. Be advised, if you choose to eat and have drinks, you will possibly exceed $100 (including tickets). The food is OK; however, I don't think that the cost is worth it. We usually go to the 7:00 P.M. shows, then go to dinner at one of the numerous restaurants in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronf630
50,"Kiss Your Cash Goodbye, But Have a Great Date Night!!","We'll get the bad out of the way. It's expensive. I treated my boyfriend to opening weekend of LEGO Batman here and getting two butts into seats cost right around $60. Take advantage of the menu and the drinks and it skyrockets from there. Take a breath, say a prayer, and swipe the card.After that, it was GREAT FUN. We are big movie lovers and Cinepolis was pretty much our ideal date night. The theater itself is very cool, with a bar and plenty of seating areas to enjoy a pre-movie cocktail. The auditoriums have super comfy chairs. The menu is large and the food is good. They have the old favorites like popcorn and candy, but go all the way with burgers, cheese plates, you name it! We will definitely be going back for all of the blockbusters we are most excited about.A great way to watch movies!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/813caitlink

Best seats are above the handicapped row--the ones that tier up the stairs. Downside is that all the eating and waiters around you tend to distract a bit--worst part is the waiters serving you and talking to you during the film--or worse yet handing you the bill just as the tears stream down your cheeks at the end!

Now all theaters allow kids. Yesterday we sat next to grandma and her two kids who spilled sticky sodas, french fries and popcorn all over the chairs. The chairs we sat in were torn, the table next to us sticky from previous movie-goers. The staff has twice overcharged us, so we have to stand in line to get that corrected.

It's a nice place to celebrate or make a special 'just because you deserve it' date. It's my favorite get-a-way spot.

My mom was raving about cinepolis after I took her one day so much so that she tried finding a luxury cinema near her in Orange County.

40,Lunch and a movie on a Saturday afternoon part deux,"Before coming I set up our seats by picking them online through the website. After having lunch a couple doors down we had time to stop in for a drink at the bar before the show. Cinepolis is definitely a movie theatre of the future. What do futuristic movie theaters have..... Well they have a kitchen with some over priced food items and a bar that lets you bring your drinks into the theatre or the option to order your food and drink right from your movie seat. About that the seat is a nice big BarcaLounger like you might have at home with a small table that spins around closer to you. The only problem cinepolis never offer discounts and the price for the built in opulence is the most you'll pay in town. Down the road Muvico gives you free popcorn and a $3.00 coupon for their restaurant but not here high dollar all the way. I can live with that when wanting to have a drink and be comfy at a new movie. What I can't live with is that almost every time I go I am showed some form of rudeness from either a bartender or a doorman. Customer service is not really something they promote at cineopolis. Let me give you an example, some how the powers that be in the digital age couldnt add correctly and they had the ending of the last movie and the start of mine sandwiched to close together. Instead of posting a sign, instead of making a statement to all, I listened to the little rude doorman give me a blow off of an explanation that had me scratching my head which I also watched from my lounge seat as he did to everyone else that tried to get in to the show. Finally they started letting us in but once again no courtesy statement was made, we all just had to figure it out ourselves. Before all that while having a drink at their fairly well stock bar the bartender told me that a silver and a reposado tequila is better tasting and has more of a true agave taste than a anejo.....really? ( silver aged 3 months, reposado 6 months and an anejo is aged for 1 year) Wow. Anyway to review, theatre comfy and worth checking out but prices are still very high and a several of the staff members could get a bit more training in a few areas. Also some showings here allow adult drinks into the show and some don't. Online you will see a little blue martini glass next to the times for the big people drinks if it makes a difference to you. Staff comes and goes so I will definitely come again for another movie or more when in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jedimasterkush
50,At home only better,"Who wouldn't love reclining in a big armchair, watching a first run movie and having drinks and appetizers delivered to your table? It's like having the comfort of home, but waaay better. What a luxury!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/318joycem
50,Cinepolis is the best!,"WILL NOT go to another movie theatre again! Once you've experienced a movie at this place you'll feel the same. My three kids love it! My 6'3 husband loves it! The chairs recline. You're not in an uncomfortable seat where the stranger sitting next to you is annoying you. They have a small but very convenient menu where you can order from your seat. The wait staff is awesome! There's a lounge in the reception area where you can watch tv, order food or drinks and just chill out. I've thought about going to another movie theatre and then I come to my senses and decide if it's not playing at cinepolis, I'll wait til it comes out on DVD. At this location, you'll more than likely run into a celebrity, I have almost every time I go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachellew544
40,Love This Theater!,"We made the drive down from Northern Santa Barbara County to see Star Wars here. It was a VERY long drive since we got caught in the fire-related traffic detour.We had left very early (thankfully) for what should have been a 2 hour drive and 3.5 hours later we arrived. There were plenty of previews so we were only about 10-15 minutes late for the movie. We were a bit on edge when we finally arrived...understandably...but that soon changed!! The theater was wonderful!! Just what we expected!! Staff was friendly and helpful. The servers were attentive and food came out in a reasonable amount of time. We ordered pizza (just ok), sliders (better than the pizza), and popcorn (really good popcorn here)!! Seats were beyond comfortable and roomy! (We booked on-line long in advance for this movie). The sound at the theater was amazing!! The screens are very large!! You will love this place!! Cant wait to return!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jalama
50,Worth the Extra Cost,Not cheap but well worth the extra cost for a really good night out.No need to rush to a Restaurant or Bar before hand when food and drink can be delivered right to your seat !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debbiemW7301HC
10,Bad Customer Service,"We went to see the new Star Wars while visiting California. We were the first people there and bought our tickets. The male person in charge said we could not wait in the lobby. It was freezing downstairs and outside. He did not tell us we had to wait out side. Like many others we went for a walk and came back. I am 63 and didn't want to wait outside with the people who evidently he told they had to line up outside or had been there before. We stood outside the lobby in the stair well. So when they came to let us in, he walked down and brought everyone from outside in and said we could get at the end of that line. They are lucky I didn't ask for my money back. If you are going to tell everyone but the people who buy the first tickets YOU HAVE TO WAIT OUTSIDE, then something is wrong. If you are going to make old people stand outside in below freezing weather, then you are inconsiderate. Won't ever go there again if I return to Lake Arrowhead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billmZ5454HL

I have already decided to make this my movie premier place, regular theaters just don't do it for me now. The wait staff was so nice and service was really quick. What initially brought my boyfriend and myself here was the assigned seating, it's so nice not having to worry about fighting crowds to get a good seat. I highly recommend. Family night, girls night, date night any occasion. I can't wait for my next visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/135crystalk
50,Great Experience for a Movie Night!,"My husband and I were excited to watch a movie here given we had heard so much about it, and The Cinepolis did not disappoint, we had a great time.

50,"Our night with ""The Martian""","This past Saturday we went to Cinepolis to see ""The Martian"" at the 7:45 showing. My husband loves his movie popcorn, and Cinepolis didn't disappoint: The popcorn was fresh, hot, and with just the right amount of butter. The Martian is 2 hours and 22 minutes long, but you don't even realize you're sitting that long because the recliners are SO COMFORTABLE! It truly is just like watching a movie in the comfort of your own home. Plus, the seat service is awesome. They come within a few minutes of you pressing your buzzer. We ordered mexican coffee and they were nice and toasty warm when they arrived. Mixed perfectly. I would highly recommend a visit to Cinepolis.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Banditogal

40,Luxury but a once in a bloom visit,"Without a doubt this place screams luxury and comfort but it's a not a place I'll constantly be visiting for movie nights. For what I pay here including food, drinks, etc it can retail to an airplane ticket and I would rather invest that into traveling. Yes it's special to take a special one and enjoy the perks of it but they are other cinemas that offer the same style without the waiters for much more less than what they charge here. It's a good place, clean but the device is average though I won't rate this place average because it's far from it but the staff deserves a much better, friendly service coaching. Overall, it's very good but ill visit this place once in a blue moon! Worth visiting at least once to get a taste of a luxurious cinema.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnacarter14

40,Big Comfortable Seating,Sitting in the first row is just fine in this theatre! Plenty of room in front and food & bar service comes right to your seat with the press of a button.

Overall a good experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SantaRosaSue
50,Movie madness,"Always a great venue to attend to see a movie. Comfortable, not too small theatre's & great service. You can purchase anything @ the counter & bring it in yourself or purchase it while sitting comfortably in the theatre seat ordering by waiter. Prompt & courteous. Depending on the movie & time you can also attend a movie to be able to order a alcoholic drink. The same goes for eating by the bar. They have a menu of small plates & large menu of a variety of drinks. Its a place when you try it once, you definitely come back again & again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenK366
20,Sorry State for a Fancy Theater,"We keep re trying the Cinopolis Theater, as it has reclining spacious and tickets can be ordered ahead on line. There are options for food, and in the 21 theater, alcoholic beverages. The food choices are always below average, the wait time for service is slow. This past weekend the bathroom worse than an unkept service station, with trash on the floors, no toliet tissue, seat covers,or paper towels. It surprises us that this theater isn't run better in such a affluent area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/904karieh

30,Double check if you want cocktails,"We have been here several times and it's very nice, however they need to be more clear on when drinks are served. There have been a few times when we wanted cocktails and thought we were going to a show where they were served ....but we were wrong.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliecG317AL
40,Online/App Needs Attention; Otherwise Very Good,"Cinepolis is an excellent high-end theater, offering food and (in certain theaters—more on which below) drinks, comfortable reclining chairs, and an overall premium theater-going experience.Around the edges, though, there are a few problems. The theater has its own app, which is poorly designed, overly clicky, and slow to load. Worse still is that, on at least two occasions, it has mis-represented whether the theater for which I'm purchasing tickets offers alcoholic beverages or not.If you're paying the premium price to watch a movie, this should not happen, ever. Information stated should be accurate.One final thing—servers will, on occasion, present you with the bill at the absolute climax of a film. This is annoying, as you can imagine, even though it's understandably difficult for them to time their check-drops. It's just an inherent difficulty of the serving model.Beyond this, though, it's worth a fair drive to experience a movie here. And every theater should be reserved-seating only, IMHO. Waiting in line is for the birds.Recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandersMusic

50,Just Awesome,My husband and I tried this theater the other day. Wow. You can select your personal recliner before you arrive. You can order your food and drinks... then just relax and watch your movie. It is more expensive but it is so worth it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MistyK_12
40,Can't beat the leather recliners with footrests,"In the Westlake Village Promenade, for special ocassions or date nights this is the best theater in town. The high price brings in a more adult crowd, so no screaming babies, and no noisy younger children. (I love mine, but I leave them with a sitter).Wine is high priced for the very small pour you get.The food was average in taste, but very convenient to have it brought to your own adjustable glass pivoting table/tray.Movie prices are from $21 for adults or $19 for seniors.Above all, there's nothing like reclining back, raising your feet up on the footrest, and enjoying a calm and luxuirous evening here. Plenty of free parking, and more around the back if front lot gets too full.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avidtraveller15
40,"Very nice place, expensive!","Went to the luxury showing to try it out, it was great, nice seats, adults only, less seats so not crowded at all. Prices are double for viewing a movie, but that was no big deal, but if you want some of their wine, look out. $15 for about 3-4 oz of wine. Cost me $36 for two small wines and a water. alcohol Drink prices are stupid expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ranbud
40,"Luxury movie watching experience, great special date night place.","Went here with my boyfriend this past Friday night to see Jurassic World since we happened to be in the area thanks to my boyfriend's obsession with the lovely area.But - no complaints from me. This is the nicest movie theater I have ever been in - and have been to AMC and Muvico theaters in the past.It's quite the concierge type of setting. Lots of sitting area while waiting for your show, a beautiful bar and very modern design inside.Of course - as is our luck - who should come walking by as we are just lounging waiting for our movie - Kris Jenner and her new boyfriend Corey plus a couple more in the entourage. She said good bye and thanked the service folks as she left - which I thought was good of her.Things to know about this theater - it's $38 bucks for a couple to see a show. You pick your seats when you buy your tickets. I don't believe there is a bad seat in the theater the way it's laid out.We headed inside and were escorted to our seats - comfy cushy reclining leather sofa seats. No better way to watch a movie and I am bit spoiled now.I hit the recline button and stretched out to watch a great movie.I didn't order anything to eat since we had eaten before hand, but the prices were ok. They were what I would expect for this type of experience. Not your usual movie food - no - the menu looked really good.I imagine you could spend close to $100 on tickets, drinks and food here.But, you know your date is worth it - so splurge and impress the heck out of them.I will definitely go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Valogreeneyez

30,"Love the seating, service slow and expensive","We have been to the AMC Dine in theater in Marina del Rey, but we decided to try the dine in theater experience at Cinepolis in Westlake. In comparison to the AMC, I will say I like the plush seats better at Cinepolis, but it stops there. AMC has better and quicker service. I had a gourmet burger that was very good, but also in excess of $15. There were not enough servers for dine in either. Taking about 10 minutes to get some popcorn. The amount of food you get is also less than AMC. The positives are; decent food, very clean theater and very comfortable seating, however we will probably return to AMC for future dine in experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZumaDawg
50,Expensive but enjoyable,"Went for a date here and was a little blown away by the prices. The tickets themselves aren't astronomical, but they get you with the food. Super comfortable seats (love seat style, so perfect for a romantic movie-watching experience). It took forever to get our drinks/food, so it was a bit disruptive to the film. Wouldn't do this every time I see a movie, but it is a fun, luxurious experience for a special occasion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kallanchen

Food can be ordered and is served in your seats. Really amazing food-sound and visual of movie also great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cimcat
30,Love/hate relationship,Very high end theater. Seating is great. Never crammed in. Servers to bring your snacks and drinks. Not overpriced for the value. That's the love. Now the hate. Bring earplugs for the previews. So loud it's painful to the ears. Also if you are sitting on the sides with the a/c vents bring a parka. You will freeze.Even with that it's the only theater we go to now.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/374scotty
50,Amazing,"When to go see Furious 7... This was the first time at this theater. Loved it! We ordered our tickets on-line, was able to pick our seats and just walk in. The seats are so comfortable and roomy. Sit back and relax like you were at home. If you want food or drinks all you have to do is push a button. They bring it right to your seat. Did not use this service but it's nice if you want it. Everything on the menu was pricey. The bathrooms are huge and very clean. All the staff was very friendly and helpful. Definitely will be going back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dawn7h7

40,My Favorite movie theater,"Prior to the last few visits this would have without a doubt been a 5 star + review. They seem to be slacking a bit. The theater itself is amazing, the seats are SO comfortable, the menu is great and the bloody marys are delicious! I love the 21 and over theaters where they deliver drinks to your seats. While the menu is great, the food service the last few times has not been up to par although it would not dissuade me from visiting the theater. Also, you have to try the warm caramel popcorn...delish!! Buy your tickets on line and select your seats early, this theater does sell out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hmarton
30,Way overpriced and the food is just so so at high price,"A typical Cinepolis as the furnishings are top drawer as is the staff. We had food which while was just ok, the price was over the top. When a movie for two with two snacks is $100 (during the day) I cannot be a repeat visitor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fdl1948
20,Nice Theater but Service Severely Poor,"The theater is advertised as a luxury theater. By all means the seats and the setting were cozy. One can order a cocktail or a bottle wine and food where you sit. So, this is a great concept. However, the food isn't luxury; it's more like bar food by a chain. The drinks are priced on the higher side. The one great problem is the service and customer empathy. Upon entry one sees a bevy of servers all dressed in black. While one thinks this will represent great service, it is otherwise. It took over a 1/2 hour to get our drinks and an hour to get our food (a cheese plate half way through the movie). Our unhappy experience was validated when we were exiting our particular movie room. A woman came running out from another movie room asking that her drink order be cancelled because her drinks had not been delivered and the movie was more than half over. The puzzling factor was that there were so many servers taking orders, but an extremely long time to return with the order. Our order was placed well before the movie started. They admitted it was unreasonably long, but all they did was smile. One expects a little more service when a total bill is over a hundred dollars for two people, just to see a movie.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R_n_R_Travellers

And I cant help myself and compare all those experiences with Cinepolis. Others pale n comparison.Why don't I come here every time?

It is really a splurge given the expensive ticket prices and the expensive food/drink.Also, keep in mind that only select movies/theaters are 21+, so if you have kids you can't go or alternatively if you are going with the idea that you'll have a drink, you might be disappointed. Check their website to make sure what you are getting!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vacationman18
30,Enticing concept but doesn't work for me,"Although I was astonished at the price of the tickets when I walk into what I thought was a regular movie theater, I was quite pleased with the reclining seats. The sound and pictures are excellent. For me, the problem was trying to focus on the movie because I was constantly distracted by waiters walking around and people ordering food. I only pay for expensive movies if I am truly interested in seeing them. Accordingly, I don't like to be distracted by waiters and people eating loudly in the theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAWildBill
20,"Expensive, horrible service","Yes, they have wonderful, comfortable seat, but the customer service and food are horrible. The manager was selling tickets and he was unfriendly and rude. (He should try smiling and saying thank you.) Our sliders were like cold hockey pucks. Service in the theater is awful. Asked for napkins - never received them. Our sodas were delivered 10 minutes after our food and barely had any ice.This theater is expensive because it's Westlake. Great seats, but that's about it. The sound is much better at Muvico, too - along with their customer service and popcorn! I'd go back to Cineopolis only to see a movie that's 3 hours or longer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KonaMom2
50,Enjoyed Gravity and the 3D,"We had not been to this theater and it was the perfect venue for 3D. You feel like you are in your living room with comfortable adjustable leather seats. There is food and drink you can order to enjoy during the movie. It is not inexpensive, but great for a special evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/228Marilyn1016
40,Excellent movie experience for those willing to pay for service,"My family loves Cinepolis, 2 adults and 2 teens. In comparison to other theaters where I do not get to reserve a specific set of seats, I consider Cinepolis correctly priced for what they offer and I am happy to pay the rate. Super sound, great screens!We love and appreciate the big reclining chairs -- but we are taller people ranging from 5'8' to 6'4"" and strufggle to be confortable in standard cinema chairs. We like that food service is available at our seat. Our servers have always been excellent and attentive. The food quality is far superior to the regualr snack-shack type food that you expect at a movie. The menu has ""real"" food; burgers, pastas, salads, etc. And, alcohol -- and the drinks are GOOD. Martinis are well done, wines are excellent. Drinks are priced close as a neighborhood bistro.The movie schedule has shows that are for all ages, and many that are for 21 and over (so that alcohol may be served.) If you want to attend a movie and have no kids, no teens, no rowdy youngesters in the crowd, these shows are the ones to go to!My gripe with Cinepolis is with their scheduling. We often like to take groups of kids/teens to movies. The schedule of movies does not come out very far in advance. There was one time we were ""anticipating"" a movie to be shown at 2pm on a Friday afternoon, and we were going to take 10 kids. The movie was shown, and int he slot we anticipated, but it was changed to be a 21 and over slot. Thus, we had to take our group to another theater. I had called customer service in advance to try to plan this movie; they were helpful but did not have a locked-in schedule so their advice was to keep checking back.Publishing a longer schedule of movies/times for patrons is my only recommendation.Try a movie at Cinepolis, it is an excellent experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MalibuGirl1982
20,Luxury Movie Date Maybe - Not for a family night out to see a show,"I want to the Cineopolis with my family and it is certainly a step beyond similar theaters. The seats are high end, the offerings on the personally lite menus are good, the lobby is very nice and so are the prices. Seats are $17.50 - even for kids and the food and beverages are equally as expensive.I would say this is a great place for a date if you want to impress the person you are with that you like the finer things in life and don't mind paying for them.On the other hand if you want to see a movie with your wife and two kids I would not recommend this theater of any of their sister sites.I won't say it was not fun or that I did not have a good time. I'm just saying $52 for 3 tickets and $24.50 for a popcorn, 2 sodas and a small milkshake is not this family's budget for a night out to see a show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/schnedavid
30,Great Movie Theater,"Nice movie theater in a great location in Westlake Village. The weekends are crowded, but during the week it's not too bad. Since the area is very family-oriented, for those who are not big fans of theaters with a lot of kids, this is probably not the best place to see a movie. The screens and sound are really amazing though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Muzicatty
40,Unusual theatre,"First time here. Seats are large, comfortable, electronically recline almost to the level of a bed! Large, cushioned arm rests. Small table between seats. Even the seats close to the screen are fine because there is lots of space between rows. I would not come here to see movies regularly but it is a nice place to go on special occasions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrMitch
50,Great 3D viewing!,"We frequently go to this theater. Great luxury seating with recling over stuffed chairs. Great for watching 3D movies. Saw Gravity, we were dodgeing meators and space craft throughout the movie. Food and beverage available at your seat. My favorite is the sliders. Wonderful experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CathieP_12
50,like watching a movie in your own home!!,"the best movie viewing venue ever!! have a drink….dinner….gourmet popcorn….put your feet up, lean back and enjoy the show!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingal1009
30,Eat before your movie.,We have come here 5 or 6 times and only had one good meal. They just dont have it down yet. Do book your movie a day in advance as they are very small and sell out quickly Bar area is nice but very bright,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Delphenis
50,GREAT,Wonderful place to see a movie. Food is surprisingly good and reasonable. I enjoyed the Humus plate.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelmF120SB
50,Great adult night out,"Not your typical movie theatre. No noisy teenagers. You can have dinner and drinks served by wait staff while watching your movie as you sit in really comfy recliners with your feet up. Drinks are good, food isn't bad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lovinlife818
30,"The food was terrible, the seats were nice","The recliners were great, but the food was not. For the price, I think there are better movie theaters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/txrosley
50,Heaven in movies,Outstanding and the cream of the crowd. What an awesome place. The seats are super comfy. actually so much better than first class searing on airplanes. The food you order is amazing and the sliders are great.. Just sensational and if in the area a must go experience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denisek829
50,Different Concept,"This is a one time event to do. The tickets are $20 plus any food you choose to purchase. It is so worth it. The theatre is limited and you should reserve your seats at their web site. I sat in the back row which I felt was perfect because it was less busy with waiters walking around. They do stop during the movie but if you are into trailers, forget it. I had a cheese platter that was delicious. My husband had a burger with fries which he said was very good. The seats recline all the way plus being very comfortable. My husband felt that the screen was not big enough, I felt differently. The evening cost us approx $100. That is why it becomes a one time event.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shirleys991
50,With money to burn and movies on your agenda.,"Cinepolis a fun movie destination, but you do have to tolerate the price to go see a movie in a theater that offers reclining seats that are wildly comfortable and waiters working the aisle with a martini of your choice and hot appetizers. You are not likely to have kids crying or running the aisles. If every seat is sold you are still going to have maximum comfort and the sound and screen are top notch. It also was a romantic setting for our movie date. There were no crowds because occupancy is low. It was perfectly clean, no trash bags marking broken chairs or sticky floors where you would not want to place your purse. But be prepared to part with your $$$ for food, drinks and tickets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valerieduda
40,Good for action flicks,"Everything is wildly expensive but the sound is fantastic. From tickets to drinks and food, be ready to just close your eyes and open the wallet. But for an action packed movie it's the best in town, seats are incredibly comfortable and the sound is perfect. For regular movies we go elsewhere but once in awhile to splurge, Cineopolis is fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrg128
50,Commercials really?,I have been to this theater many times before the main reason I come because I can enjoy a movie experience without annoying people kicking your chair or talking thru out the movie but I liked that we dont have to sit thru commercials till today we came to see wolverine and now they started playing commercials trailers I dont mind but to pay this much and have to watch commercials im sorry but I'll stay home instead please change it back the way it was without commercials or I will not return and will tell others not come back as well love you guys but we get enough commercials at home dont see why i have come here to pay for more.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5efrenr
40,Good movie experience.,"My daughter and me went to see Iron Man 3 here in May. We were early, so we sat in the lounge/bar area and had a chocolate fondue and some drinks. Very nice!The movie experience was also nice, it was screening in one of their luxury rooms.We're sure to go back soon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeS306
50,Spoil yourself!,"My husband and I were given a gift certificate to this theatre and had never heard of it. Oh WOW! The plush leather sofa seats recline almost all the way flat and you can put your feet up. There is a ""service"" button you can press in the middle of the feature where a superb employee (we had Wes- GREAT guy!) will come and take your order. Good food, great strong drinks, and an overall wonderful experience. We will absolutely be back... It was like a glimpse in to First Class.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShanMcD35
40,A new Movie experience.,"Really liked this place. Sound quality was AMAZING, And I consider myself an Audiophile. The Seats were comfy, and the service was great! The only gripe is on the price for the ticket. Not a place to take the whole family. But it makes a great date place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ixeyeb
50,You will never go back to a normal movie theatre,"I have been here lots of times. Very rarely is there a delay in service, but when there is they pick it up pretty rapidly. Latest movie was a packed Iron Man performance and I was ready for a delay in the delivery of food and drinks, but this didn't happen. Seats are the best, like big business class airline loungers. If you have to see a film with friends or family that you don't care for, just go anyway. You can relax, sleep, order great foods and drinks. Overall a fabulous experience. Only drawback, you cannot have a glass of wine in the under 21 theaters, even if you are clearly over 21. It's even better if you see a movie you love. Of course the price is higher than some of the other movie theaters, but you really are getting something of a higher quality for the money in my opinion. Although I know many people who are happy with movie theaters that are half the price, I'm not one of those people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SophieG1
50,The ONLY way to see a movie!,"Enjoyed the movie, the Cosmo while I watched the movie, the panini-type sandwich and the incredibly comfortable seats!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandraMom
40,No IMAX,"This is very nice theater with great seating; For the price, should offer IMAX movies. The food is so-so. For the price, should also offer free popcorn. It is pricey, nice comfy seating, adult theater might be worth the splurge. The under 21 theater, not so much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whocareswhoiam
50,Luxurious and Roomy,"First time in a theatre such as Cinepolis......the chairs are unbelievable, just like a lounge chair at home.....your personal area is huge and roomy. Food delivery was good, although the popcorn was stale and had very little butter on it, so that was disappointing, but overall, the place is fantastic and a great way to watch a movie",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Edmundo_de_ABQ
20,Take a blanket!!,The experience would have been lovely if the place hadn't been FREEZING COLD. When we walked in a lady a little behind us had a blanket: more fool me for thinking she was odd ...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ESB-UK
40,WOW - Great Experience - Everyone should try at least once!,"How great to have the comforts of your own living room while watching a movie! Of course it is a unique experience, and somewhat awkward trying to eat and drink while reclining in a luxury recliner, but the uniqueness of seeing a movie and being served food and drink at your seat was just so much fun!!! The theatre is gorgeous and after our first experience we were to come back the next night for another movie (we were only in Westlake for a very short time) but, when we arrived the next night, a water main had broken and flooded the theatre. We were told that once their computers were back up, we'd get a refund for our purchased tickets, but I've yet to hear from them - the staff seemed shell-shocked over the flood and did not know how to handle the customers who had paid. They advised that they may be closed for weeks. But, we did have one night of fun, and I look forward to my refund for the movie we missed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinah3
50,Splurge a little!,"My husband and I loved this luxurious theatre with super comfortable seats and reservations. We shared a wonderful chicken panini and enjoyed the whole experience. Now, if they only made better movies we both wanted to see!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PMB4
10,Don't bother!,"Very pricey tickets, even for CA. The seats are comfortable and the idea of service is good, but in reality it is awful. The staff are constantly walking in front of you with food orders. The people next to us wanted to go through the entire menu with the waitress in a loud voice so we missed a good 10mins of the movie. They just kept pressing that service button and our entire movie was interrupted. Never again! It is definitely not worth the money. The glass of wine I had was the most expensive one I've ever bought in Westlake Village, and they have some high prices.I'll give them 1yr before they close or turn back into the family style movie theatre they were beforehand.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KiwisLA
50,watching movies in a recliner??,"all the comforts of home with the big screen. I think I'll bring a blanket next time. It's pretty pricey at $19.50 a ticket, but some movies are worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/horse54
20,Too much $ for a movie and awkward service,"Been here twice. First time I was very impressed with the comfy seats and willing to overlook the high price for a movie ticket (even higher for 3D movie). We ordered food about 30 minutes before the movie started and did not get our meals until after the movie started. Did not plan on eating in the dark which made it impossible to see what the nasty cheese like substance was in my sandwich. Second time, ordered a cocktail before the movie started and asked for a cup of water. Got the wrong drink and a BOTTLE of water along with a bill for over $20. Between the confused servers, slow service, high prices and most of all frequent interruptions during the movie while food, drinks, checks, change... are being passed over you, this is not a place I will return to for a movie.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BethTO
40,"Cool concept, servers still need to work on delivery","There's no question the comfort level is great and the ambiance can't be beat. The food is a little overpriced, but I guess you pay for the conveninece of someone bringing it to you. However, they definitely do seem to have a lot of kinks on getting the right stuff to the right people. Both times we've gone we've seen servers walking up and down the asiles trying to get drinks to the right person - seems like it shouldn't be that hard since every seat has a number!Good place to see a movie for a night out, and I was glad to find that it wasn't distracting to have waiters walking around (people generally stop ordering stuff once the movie starts so there's not as much movement, and they are pretty good about ducking down so they don't block the screen). Between Muvico and CInepolis I would probably choose Muvico, but this is still definitely worth checking out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bruingirl_8
50,Best movie experience EVER!!,"I was completely amazed with my movie experience; they offer the basic movie food alongside gourmet food and very fine wines. Who can ask for any more?I enjoyed sitting in my own comfortable reclining seat. I enjoyed quite a bit of good food off their vast menu, I ate the TROPICAL SHRIMP SKEWER and the FLATBREAD PIZZA with burrata cheese & prosciutto, nothing but the most amazing flavor profiles I have ever had before. The theater also has a full bar but I shared a bottle of wine (which was extraordinary in itself) with my family, there’s always next time to try the cocktails. I sure wish the San Francisco Bay Area had at least one Cinepolis in this area; I would be here once a week.****NOTE** Make sure the movie showing allows for alcohol consumption*** Menu** http://cdn.cinepolisusa.com/sitecontent/menu.pdf",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnitaB42
50,"OK, this is the only place to watch a movie","This is what I have been waiting for. I hate going to movies, you always get the guy in front of you with the big head or the lady behind you talking on the cell. This place doesnt have that problem. Great lounge chairs with full bar service. The food and service is great. Its pricey for the tickets and the food but it actually very good. I kept trying to pause the movie so I could go to the restroom. I thought I was at home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PacificAndyLa
50,A wonderful movie experience,"My husband and I have been to Cinepolis twice now, once with friends, and once on our own. We love that you can have food and/or wine beer while you are enjoying the movie. The best part of the experience is the experience of the comfortable huge leather seats that recline. It is so comfortable, and there is plenty of room and privacy, as the next movie goer is not very close at all. Last time we went, there was a well-known actor in the row in front of us. Highly recommend Cinepolis!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caukwiphyllis
