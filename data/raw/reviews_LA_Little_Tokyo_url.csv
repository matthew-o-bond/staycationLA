If you are looking for something to do in the afternoon, you can see most of this place in that time. There are NO PUBLIC RESTROOMS around the area, so plan on going to the bathroom before you go. Lots of signs about this around everywhere, and don't even think of asking a person who works there where the bathroom is. The restaurants have bathrooms and will let you use them if you buy something there. Most places don't have AC so it can get quite hot if you are down there on a warm day.",Traveler9826465

It came up on Google Maps, and there were signs, but we immediately felt uncomfortable, and were unsure of what part to even visit. We drove just a few blocks to find parking, and immediately entered an area littered with homeless people. They were so thick. I later researched as we were also looking for the Arts District, which we also did not visit because we didn‚Äôt feel safe, and found out that was Skid Row, a very unsafe place. So, research where to go do you don‚Äôt end up in the area we did.",Ryan Becky J

I was so bummed that they sold out (2 separate occasions) when I got there in the afternoon. There is bubble tea everywhere! We spent about an hour there without eating. Parking is the only difficult thing about getting here. We looked for street parking and it was $4/hr. There were parking garages but not sure what the costs were. Overall, if you have time to stop for a treat or wanted authentic Japanese food, definitely stop by!",Greenapplepies
50,Great Family Fun,"Last Sunday my family spent Mother's Day at Little Tokyo. It was great. Since it had been several years since my last visit, I'd forgotten how festive and fun the area could be. And the kids loved it. It started with a lovely lunch on the patio of a typical Japanese sushi restaurant. I have not eaten in many of the restaurants in the square, but this one certainly has the best patio views right across from a rock garden and central to those entering the mall or strolling through the area. I had a ramen bowl, but everyone else (even the six and nine-year-old children) devoured raw fish and rare beef. After our meal, the three children wanted to see the mall. It was heaven for anime fanatics and all three used their own money to buy anime trading cards. It was then to the Godzilla store to ogle the huge Godzilla toys. The six year-old twins talked us into some small, Godzilla trinkets. From there it was on to an amazing mochi and ice cream parlor across from the fountain where an old man sings an odd m√©lange of music. It was getting late, but we weren't done. A 50% off shoe sale pulled us into a store where great bargains in name brand shoes resulted in another purchase. By this time it was getting even later, so reluctantly we went home with promises to the children that we would come back very soon.",lollydepaulo

As, where i am from, there is only 'china towns', which is general an area with stores and restaurants and minimal Chinese influenced architecture. This felt like a mini, westernised Japanese village. Little shopping village with lots of food and shopping. Hello kitty store was great - can make LA/sanrio coins - great for tourist. Didn't try the food. Shopping was very specific to Japan/American. There was an information centre on the same street. However, wouldn't really know it was there. The 'Temples' werent anything impressive. I did not go to the museums. Japanese shopping centre with diaso close by. Walking distance to downtown. Close to the train station.

30,Just okay,We were in Los Angeles at the Broad museum and decided to visit Little Tokyo while in town for the day. A bus ran right to it which was convenient. It was a mixture of small restaurants and assorted merchandise shops. Nothing like a major Chinatown in San Francisco or New York. Not particularly exotic if that's what one is seeking.

40,My Ramen Bar,"Location:321 1/2 E 1st St, Los Angeles, CA 90012Diamond in the rough.With a whole block of ramen restaurants, My Ramen Bar seems to get the overflow of customers mainly from the popular Daikokuya ramen restaurant. For those who do not want to wait to get seated, My Ramen Bar is usually not overly crowded. From the negative comments of dissatisfied customers, I could see how service can be slow. Since the owner is the only person preparing the food, it is understandingly reasonable for him not to greet customers at their table. There was one Caucasian waiter who was very friendly, informative, but not too attentive to needs after the orders are served. Granted, he was the only waiter for the entire restaurant, so you could say that the restaurant could have hired at least one additional food server. I ordered the black original ramen, which is roasted black garlic oil. It did not taste garlicky at all. The flavor was extraordinarily delicious, but the portion was abnormally small for the price compared with most ramen restaurants. The temperature of the broth could have been hotter because it was served warm. The next time I venture out to J-Town for ramen at Daikokuya and the line is too long, I wouldn't mind going to back My Ramen Bar. My Ramen Bar was surprisingly better than I expected it to be.",Ken U

One usually doesn't think ""pastries"" when one thinks of Japan, but the Japanese really know bread. I buy the thick slices every time I visit.

50,Historic and culturally rich,"I don't think many of the reviewers here understand the significance of Little Tokyo.The first Japanese business (a restaurant) opened here in 1885. The area was a vibrant community of 35,000 Japanese, covered 3 square miles and included stores for every need, restaurants, temples, movie theaters, concert halls, social clubs and a school. War time hysteria led to the imprisonment of all people of Japanese decent, including US citizens, and LT became a ghost town. During those years in the 1940s the area, needing renters became known as Bronzeville, a thriving African American community, home to LA's first AME church on 2nd Street and many popular jazz clubs and storefronts. After WWII, the Japanese community returned. But it was never the same.Further erosion to the community occurred when land was taken to build Parker Center and other redevelopment projects, and the area shrank to today's little footprint.With younger generations moving to the suburbs, and little interest in continuing ""the family business"" it is a wonder that LT has survived at all, given its history. Today, several decades old businesses are still here along side new businesses catering to foodies and hipsters that have brought new life to the area. LT is now enjoying a renaissance.Those who only see ""fake"" or ""Disney-like"" or ""dirty"" qualities are missing the real and rich history here, and this community continues to exist through grit, hard work, pride and joy.After living on the East Coast for most of my adult life, being in Little Tokyo is like coming home.",Hejimoto

10,Overrated and a bit junky,"I live about a mile from Little Tokyo and am half Japanese so I WANT to love it but well......there are SO many things that bother me about this area.1 - Most of the businesses have taped signs everywhere saying ""NO photos. NO food and drink. NO pets. You break it you buy it!"" and here's my favorite one ""This is NOT a toy. It's a decoration. DO NOT play with it"". Almost every other business is like this. It makes me not want to buy anything from them or even go into the store for that matter. On top of this, many of the staff are extremely unfriendly.2 - Alot of the stores and restaurants are run down and junky, some of the restaurants are rather shocking actually and need a total clean up / revamp. They need to step it up, some of the restaurants look like they haven't been cleaned in 20 years!3 - Plastic bags are banned in LA and yet almost every business there uses them - in abundance!4 - There are a lot of non-Japanese businesses mixed in like a kabab shop, Starbucks and many others. This should only be Japanese businesses, it loses it's charm otherwise.5 - A lot of the businesses claim to sell Japanese product but 99% of it is made in ChinaThe best businesses in the whole area are Poketo, Jason Marks and Japanangeles which have all elevated the area to a new level. The other businesses should take note.",reviewsmatter12345
50,Fun and Historic Location,"What a great place! Little Tokyo is full of great restaurants, great shops, great museums, temples, and it has been the cultural hub of the Los Angeles Japanese-American community forever. They have several Japanese-based festivals that take place here throughout the year. This is truly one of those Los Angeles locations that everyone should visit.Little Tokyo spans a number of city blocks that are approximately flanked by Alameda, Los Angeles, 1st, and 3rd Streets. Withing in these boundaries is the location where the majority of the businesses of Little Tokyo reside. Certainly, Japanese Village Plaza and the streets that surround it plays a large part in housing many of the shops and restaurants but there are other locations like the Little Tokyo Galleria that is also a central business hub for the community.As in many places that surround the central downtown area, parking can be a bit tricky in Little Tokyo; especially on the weekends. You have to keep your eyes open but there are several multi-story parking lots around the area. There is also a few outdoor lots and there is street parking. Off course, on off-hours, during the week, parking is much easier. But, the parking situation should not keep you away. You can also take mass-transit, walk, or bike to Little Tokyo.Little Tokyo is a fun, interesting, and educational place to visit time-and-time again.Recommended!",Scott S

40,Roses among thorns,"Loved this place, but it's filthy and it has some aggressive street folks.Now, on to the good stuff!The shops are plentiful and varied. Gift shops, a tea room, restaurants galore. Nijiya market is always great. Grab and go sushi and sashimi! Marukai market is worth the trip alone. ALL sorts of groceries. Limited hot foods available. The sake aisles may be short, but there are 3 of them. Arranged from basic to high end, I could have broken the bank easily. Gift wrapped sweets. Very clean. Excellent staff.The top selling point, for me, is Kinokuniya bookstore. Anime and manga, as well as books and magazines in both English and Japanese. Excellent, helpful staff.Anime Jungle is across the street. Those who enjoy can get just about anything wished for.There is a Buddhist temple there too. You'll see monks strolling around. So sweet and super friendly.The Japanese Village is the location of all except Kinokuniya and Marukai market. The Village is untouched by the icky stuff that surrounds it.I'd recommend a visit - or two.",usblueflyer

30,"""not really worth the trip""","The key here is that this is ""little"" Tokyo or perhaps better labelled TINY Tokyo. Its maybe 2 blocks squared and there isn't much to see or do here. Compounded is the fact that they are moving all the homeless out and squeezing in high rise condos making parking hard to find and expensive and making this tiny area overcrowded.Can get a good meal here and that's about it",Randy G

Mall highlights: Daiso = the Japanese $1.50 store, Dorcas= upstairs, cool cute pens, theres also a grocery store in the mall and a shop that sells cream puffs. The village plaza down the street has great shopping too. I like Kools for fun jewelry (more LA Rock n roll and vintage style, not japanese), the ice cream mochi at Mikawaya (not to be missed) and its fun to look at all the shops in the plaza. Near the friendship knot sculpture there's Marukai market on Onizuka Street thats fun to shop in too. And you should eat in Little Tokyo too!! Lots of restaurant options.

40,Love Little Tokyo!,This is such a fun neighborhood downtown. So many different restaurants and cute little shops to visit! Some of the best ramen in LA and really good sushi options. Also - I'm a huge fan of Far Bar.,KaylaB874
40,A bit on the touristy side but worth visiting for a meal,Area is very eclectic and going through a transition now that the Arts District is being gentrified. Many of the restaurants are a bit downtrodden. The Hilton Doubletree rooms in particular are in dire need of major interior redecoration.,hakccmd
40,Little Tokyo Rocks,"Japan Town in San Francisco has gone away, leaving Little Tokyo as one of the last remaining Japanese-Towns on the West Coast. Although there has been a lot of development in the area and it is no longer the exclusive realm of Japanese American family owned shops there is still a lot of cool things to see and do here. The Japanese American National Museum, the shops in the village, the restaurants, the temples and churches, the Japanese Cultural Community Center - these are all reminders that this area was once a living Japanese-American community. These days most of the Japanese Americans who grew up here and in the boyle heights area have moved elsewhere, and given that Japanese Americans statistically have a higher outmarriage rate than all other Asian groups I believe that there is a need to treasure and preserve Little Tokyo so that those of my community can stay in touch with our roots.",Steven S
30,Nice but you can skip it,"Don't get me wrong, because I love everything Japan, but ...Little Tokyo is really small, nice but only a couple of streets.If you're in LA for more than a week it's OK to visit and have lunch or dinner.

40,Fun place to visit,I went there by train my with my daughter. The place made me feel I was in Japan again. I lived in Japan for 3 years 20 years ago and I was happy to see Japanese decorations and stores that sell cute items. There were lots of food choices. We bought food from the bakery and they tasted great. Then we sat outside to watch and listen to a musician playing a Japanese instrument. We walked around and took pictures.We felt safe. Someone even told us the directions when he overheard me and my daughter asking each other where to go. We will surely love to come back someday.,hellopusa
50,Festival at Little Tokoyo,Fun Outing to the Niesi Festival in Little Tokoyo at the Japanese American Cultural Center. Great diversity of people came out to celebrate the Japanese culture. So many people were extremely gracious and friendly in teaching a little about history and artistic expressions. We were lucky enough to experience painting Japanese characters with brushes and ink. and watching some traditional dolls being made. The Bonsai trees were lovely. Delicious lunch in town where even a child who is stuck on good old American food could get a nice lunch very reasonably. Great sushi and traditional pastries.,Shallwe_danceuai
30,Lots of food for sure,I have yet to visit Japan - just waiting for that day when I can spend at least a month there! So with that said I don't have much to compare to but as an Angeleno we are there at least once every couple of months for the food mainly. We did once take the time to walk around to see what's available but it's mostly small gift shops and lots of food. The whole town is all walking distance and you don't need more than a few hours to cover most parts. Oh there is a museum but again pretty small so half a day at most you'll need. I have found some good sushi places and a homemade mochi ice cream place. I have heard that there is a good homemade noodle place which I have yet to try. There is a big mall but again pretty much food and gift shops... oh yeah and a bowling alley great for the entire family. Overall I'm sure this is just a small tiny tiny taste of Japan - but if you're in LA craving some good sushi with a location to walk around for good vibes then you might enjoy it...,Sy S
40,Nice piece of Japan in L.A,We visited Little Tokyo from reviews of TripAdvisor and we were not disappointed. There are some great collectibles in the specialist shops for anime characters. The Japanese cuisine were all very busy so we did not get chance to try. But we did try out the tea specialist cafe and that was very good. Worth a visit if you are near the neighbourhood.,Ron C

People sleeping in tents on streets filled with trash. We were walking back to our car parked by Office Depot and a homeless person passed us and shouted something to my daughter, which rattled us a bit. Just keep that in mind. We didn't find anything unique to Japan to buy here with the exception of food products. My daughter is an anime fan and so I think we expected to see an abundance of this. After 3-4 stores, and not seeing anything that peaked our interest, we left.",NickAlixMom

After 1990s there were less and less Japanese stores/restaurants and it was quiet for a long time. Recently thanks to fans of modern Japanese culture such as anime and manga it seems that Little Tokyo is recovering its previous vigor, though only about 30% of stores are actually owned by the Japanese or Japanese Americans. Also redevelopment of the surrounding areas attract more young people. I recently took my non-Japanese friends to Little Tokyo and they had a good time eating in a Japanese restaurant and enjoying shopping in Japanese stores.",Edokko29

40,Interesting Japanese Village near City Hall,I often enjoy lunch in Little Tokyo. There is the very authentic Mitsuru Cafe or some of the more modern restaurants. There are some stores that sell Japanese goods and a fun Bowling Center.,love2skiLosAngeles
10,Not much to see or do - not worth it,"Sorry to be so harsh, but little Tokyo is boring. There is nothing really to see or do. There are about 15 shops selling stuff that any other Japense store in the city sells. It really is a fixer, not worth a visit.",Blondenomad94
40,Very cool place to visit,"One of my favorite places to visit when I want some good ramen and some solid Asian deserts. There are a lot of bakeries, sushi joints and shops that sell Japanese trinkets, food, cookware etc...My favorite places for food are:- Diakokuya (great Ramen)- Cafe Ducle (great Donuts)- Nijiya Market (grocery store with suntory products)",OrangeCountyJay
30,A so so substitiet to a 10-hour flight,"An attempt to be a quaint shopping streets in Japan, if you've been there you say, not even close. Tourist shops and restaurants are intermingled in the narrow space.An outdoor mall as an interruption to your normal shopping.",Phayao13
20,Dirty and almost nothing like Tokyo,"I love Japanese food and am interested in the culture, so I had high hopes for Little Tokyo. Unfortunately, I didn't find it nearly as enjoyable as I remembered. It felt absolutely nothing like when I briefly visited Tokyo last year (or like when I visited Japan Town in San Francisco the year before).We arrived at the main mall before noon and many of the stores weren't even open yet! It's not a very good neighborhood. One outdoor area had an unpleasant smell; my mom commented that she thought there were cats there, and I said I HOPED it was cats. (In retrospect, I don't think it was cats. I don't think there's much in the way of public restrooms; at least, we had no luck. If that's going to be an issue for you, look that up before you go to make sure you'll be covered. I know there is one at the public library a few blocks away, but despite the signs, it seems people use them as washrooms.)Since the one drink place we saw wasn't even open at noon, we went across the street to find a boba/bubble tea. (It was good AND they had the sports drink ""Pocari Sweat,"" so I could finally bring one back to another friend who had wanted to try it. They also had some random Japanese sweets like wasabi Kit-Kat. Unfortunately, the lids on our drink were ill-fitting, so they leaked repeatedly, and the boba got stuck in the straw.)We then went back to the main area to shop (with brief interludes of getting begged for money by various strangers). Some of the shopkeepers were not very friendly. When my friend asked how much a fan cost, the woman literally snatched it from her hand and refused to sell it to her. Another shopkeeper was not unpleasant, but she didn't even want to take my $20 bill, asking for something smaller...this was a second purchase after I'd already paid her some of the last of my small bills. (She charged $5 for a little fan, which was steep, and I later found an identical fan at another shop for $3.)There ARE some cute goods, but a lot of the stores have some of the same merchandise, making a visit more an exercise of who has the lowest price (and will sell to you) than in finding the best item.My friend said the place reminded her of why she hates New York City, and she's not wrong.There were a few neat stores, so if you are looking for cute things or Anime goods, you might have a great time. I bet there were some good restaurants, too. The grocery store was nice, and I was able to get the Black Thunder mini bars I had wanted, but nothing else really lived up to my expectations.Later in our trip, in Costa Mesa, we visited a Book Off (Japanese used bookstore) and Tokyo Central (grocery store). Both had an assortment of interesting goods, and both were clean and friendly, with free parking to boot. Tokyo Central even had a lot of Anime items, figures, and random cute goods, in addition to groceries.Next time I'm hankering for some Japanese goods in the LA area, I'll just look up Japanese grocery stores, Book Off, and Daiso (Japanese $1.50 store). Little Tokyo was too deep in the city to be convenient, and it just wasn't my style.",Loves_the_rails
40,Must see when in LA,"Hard to visit LA without stopping by the Historic Little Tokyo, the largest ethnically Japanese American district in the US.

The main plaza has some of the best sushi restaurant's in town as well as stores including a Japanese/Korean makeup boutique that my lady friends loved (with imported Shiseido, etc. luxury beauty products). There is also a couple cool shopping malls in the area with a funky arcade, bowling alley, and other Japanese/Korean department stores.",Corey E
50,Quaint Conglomerate of Japanese Culture,"Little Tokyo is a rather small and fairly crowded plaza bringing together an array of sushi spots, green tea ice cream parlors, Japanese grocery stores, and sculptures and fountains, all of which make for a quaint place at which to spend a sunny Sunday afternoon. For tourists, Little Tokyo might not be the easiest destination, as it requires a rather long drive and train ride from West LA; however, with other attractions nearby, including the Japanese-American National Museum (across the street); the Disney Hall; Downtown LA; and many recently developed and refurbished trendy neighborhoods, it might be well-worth the trek.",Jason A
40,Lots of good Japanese restaurants,"I never thought of Little Tokyo as an attraction - but more of a place to find great Japanese restaurants and markets.

40,Good place for Japanese food and fashion,"Compare to other ethnic community I visited in Los Angeles, Little Tokyo is located about 4 blocks from Union Station (10 minute on foot). The concentration of stores and restaurants are in Japanese Village Plaza between 1st Street and Second Street. The plaza is very nicely and orderly designed with walking walking visitors in mind. Visitors can find numerous gift shops, boutique clothing stores (some with Japanese designers), and nice Japanese restaurants. The Japanese American Museum is located across the street (on 1st Street), Japanese Community Center and Theater is on 2nd Street. Plenty of parking for visitors both on street and parking garage.

We stayed at the Miyako Hotel, such an easy walk to downtown LA and the Geffen MOCA Museum. Filled with authentic and delectable Japanese Restaurants with a great following. This is a vibrant, vital community with substantial new apartments being built on several streets. The Japanese people have kept their language and hospitality demeanor that makes it so worthwhile experiencing it. Our walks down 1st Street and Spring Street are so enjoyable seeing The Los Angeles Times Buildings, so many beautifully restored architectural gems, and striking modern buildings.

If you're looking for souvenirs, there's plenty to choose from but my 2 favorites places are right on 1st street. There is live entertainment on certain days and hours in the center of Little Tokyo village. They do have validated parking with a couple of parking garages within steps from the village. A novelty restaurant that you may want to visit is the revolving sushi bar. Grab a seat and just select the sushi dish that you want off the conveyor belt then when done, drop the plate in the slot where it counts how many plates you've eaten for $2.25 a plate.

If you're in the mood for Japanese food, you won't have to worry too much about that, because there are a plethora of choices to choose from. The shopping is fantastic as well. It has become such a hot spot, that you see so many different types of crowds from the very young, high school, cosplay types to the hipster, let's explore types, to regular family types. There's a Japanese American museum you can visit as well as a theater that puts on high quality plays.",Watergirl444
50,Fun Shopping!,"I loved shopping here. Found a lot at the Little Tokyo marketplace (like a mall). We parked in the attached garage and collected stamps at the places we ate and shopped to validate our parking. We liked the marketplace grocery store, Daiso, the creme puff bakery, and Dorcas. There's probably other cool stuff but we just didnt have much time. The rest of Tokyo Town is very close nearby, like the village plaza, cultural center, museum. So be sure to check that out too while you're in the area. Also, the MOCA (not japanese related) is in the area if you want to see art.",mishmosh_1
30,Not what it used to be....,"I'm a local so, In my early years Little Tokyo was the place to go (50-60's). It was a central shopping religious, and social area for Japanese immigrants. However, since it was established over 100 years ago, urban sprawl and changes in demographics, the number of Japanese Americans have all but disappeared. There are only a handful of original family owned businesses. Now the businesses have are primarily Japan owned businesses. Also the area is multi-ethnic and so Lil Tokyo is not descriptive of the area. The eastern area has turned into a hipster scene with new lofts and restaurants be transformed from the old commercial area of warehouses. There still die hard culture centers of the Japanese American culture that refuses to give up on the area. I hope there is a resurgence of the JA culture to keep it long lasting. It's right in the shadows of the original city hall.",TONKA2
50,Loved Little Tokyo,"So much to see and do. Stayed at the Miyako Hotel. Walked all around,ate at this great grocery store(?name) that had numerous kinds of Asian food to pick from.

There were some performance on the stage at the center of the plaza that was fun to watch. From there we walked to the Grand Central Market for lunch.,ROCruiser
30,Not a Priority,"There are so many things to do in Los Angeles that this would not be a priority. It is mainly a small area of stores with some Japanese & ramen restaurants. There is a large, fairly new Japanese American museum that I have not been to which might make a visit worthwhile. In L.A. there is also China Town and Korea Town but again, these areas exist mainly for residents and are not particularly interesting for tourists unless you want to check-out food markets and restaurants.",weRtheWorld2016

It brought back so many great memories and feelings. The stores were pretty neat. They actually seemed very like the ones in Tokyo and Kyoto. It may have been a little superficial but the place was fantastic. I really loved the stores outside of the 'main' shopping area. They seemed a bit more authentic.

Inside the supermarket, you can find imported Japanese goods and sweets which was super cool.If you already planned a tight day schedule for your vacation, but you have 2 hours to spare in-between activities, it is a perfect place to spend that little time.",alexfoodi

50,Fun and enjoyable,"We are LA residents and routinely go the Little Tokyo on Sundays. It is fun to walk around, watch some of the activities, eat Mochi icecream, crazy donuts, sweet rice, ..... so many choices. Some of the restaurants in the area have really gone up in quality, so you will find amazing food choices. Parking is available and that is a big deal too.",LenaBalt
50,Oasis w/ Authentic Japanese cuisine & a great Museum!,"Little Tokyo is a very special place located in downtown Los Angeles. It is a fun walk, fiilled with great restaurants and a pavilion with Japanese gifts and food.One of the best reasons to visit this area is to go to the Japanese American National Museum. It is unlike any museum I have ever visited and charts the complicated American history, and California history, with Japan and the Japanese people. There is a tribute to all the Japanese Americans who suffered in internment camps during World War 2 and a glimpse into one of America's greatest tragedies - jailing innocent Americans and taking away all they worked for just because of their race.A touching and amazing museum. I would highly recommend a visit to Little Tokyo and this museum for anyone visiting Los Angeles - especially history buffs or people who want their children to understand the history the the United States and tolerance.",happy

50,Dynamic and fun area of L.A.,"One can walk around and discover various sites on one's own but I would recommend either the on-line guided tour posted by the local tourist association OR a paid tour (search google to find one). Many of the restaurants are outstanding. It's a fun, fun, fun area. One of our favorite L.A. nights out is dinner at a Little Tokyo restaurant followed by theater at East West Players, housed in an historical building with plays featuring performers of various Asian backgrounds. The teahouse CHADO is a terrific place to enjoy a light lunch.",roxskin
40,Little Tokyo has great food.,Little Tokyo is in downtown Los Angeles. It's fun to walk around and check out the restaurants and the stores. They also have a market down there.

30,Little Tokyo is Sort of Boring,"Little Tokyo has shops and restaurants. There is not one restaurant that stands out as really good, so eat elsewhere. There are shops that sell creams and Japanese products so if you are in to that cool, go.But, it is really sort of boring. It is spread out about two blocks and you walk around and that is about it. There is a nice market if you have a place to cook, but if you are a visitor there is so much better to be had in Los Angeles.It is not a landmark, it is not like there was ever a huge Japanese population and surrounding cultural stuff. It is sort of a yawn.We go there to walk, when we need to get out of the office.If you are a tourist, go to Olvera Street or even Chinatown or have a great meal in Downtown. Little Tokyo is just sort of silly.",elizabethlascheid

30,Underwhelming and a bit scary,"While walking back to our car from Olvera Street, we detoured through Little Tokyo. In the small outdoor mall we browsed the shops, and rolled some pennies at the Hello Kitty! store. But the neighborhood surrounding it was depressing and run-down, with ample reminders of Los Angeles‚Äô homeless problem. While we were there, security was escorting a loud, foul-mouthed person off the premises who clearly was under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

50,Small but fun,"I really enjoyed my day in Little Toyko. There are some neat shops there to buy lots of cool Japanese stuff. I saw an ice cream shop as well, but I didn't eat there. We ate sushi at a restaurant upstairs. In the outdoor courtyard there were a few band performing, but it wasn't Japanese music. I'm not sure if they're always there, but they were singing when we visited. I had fun going from shop to shop trying to find a Japanese noodle bowl with chopsticks. I found it!",Lady R
30,When in mood of Japanese cuisine,"Little Tokyo gives a mini experience of Japan, but not Tokyo so to speak. The trees as for the outdoor touch is great, but I wasn't too impressed with the mall. Some restaurants are quite attractive, and there were several shops that you can also find in Japan, so it's pretty cute.The nice area is only the central one closed to the mall. The outer area is not that attractice, and can be really hot during summer. If I stay far from the Little Tokyo, I won't make a special effort to visit the place. But if you stay in a hotel close to the location, then it is a pretty good option to find something to eat and for a walk.",Fluffyplo

30,A small taste of Japan,"Don't expect to cross the street and jump in Japan, but the atmosphere of Little Tokyo is really nice. The neighbourhood is quite small. The architecture reminds the japanese style but the best are the restaurant and the shops. They really look as original.

Few of the restaurants will let you down, so close your eyes and dive in! And once you fill your belly with some warm soup, be sure to explore the areas little shops filled with, you guessed it, Hello Kitty extravaganzas! Okay, there is just one store like that. However, it captures the idea that many shops are loaded with Japan knickknacks. You'll find much of the items to be as useful as a pencil topper, but it doesn't mean it isn't fun to look at it.",Thomas G

40,Little Tokyo-Is it worth teh Traffic?,"If you take the train, it is a fun experience. Kind of relates a ""newer Japan"". However, for a more laid back feel, try the area around Sawtell and Olympic Blvd in West LA. I think the new Metro has a stop just South of the area, about a 10-15 minute flat walk, or can transfer to a bus that goes north on Sawtelle. The Tempura House is awesome on Sawtelle. Owned by 1st generation elderly couple, food is generous, fresh, and inexpensive. I usually do not like cutlets. Theirs is very tasty. Limited menu, only a few seats but can go to old courthouse down the street and enjoy food outside-this is LA. Next door to The Tempura House is a small grocery store with many things Japanese. I like to buy seaweed sheets for a snack or red bean rolls. Yummy!",activeB

I'm in awe of the Japanese culture so it was nice to feel like I was in Japan without the jet lag. This part of downtown Los Angeles is a real gem. There are bakeries, shops, and restaurants here along with live performances by Japanese musicians. On the afternoon that I was here an older Japanese man entertained the crowds with his great singing.A wonderful restaurant in Little Tokyo is ""Kulu Revolving Sushi."" It's one of the best restaurants ever for great food at affordable prices.Little Tokyo is a little gem in metropolis Los Angeles.",Adrianna A
50,Authentic experience that made me miss Japan,"In Little Tokyo, the Japanese Village Plaza was the plaza that inspired me to travel to Japan, and even after Japan, I still found this plaza equally charming! Despite having an area of only one or two city blocks, the plaza has everything: a mochi ice cream shop, a revolving sushi joint, a kimono shop, and more. The vibe definitely reminds me of the lovely atmosphere of the ancient street that led up to Kyoto's Kiyomizu Temple!While this is certainly a mecca for all Japanese food fan looking for a meal, this plaza is still awesome to walk through. Little Tokyo especially this piaza does truly deliver an authentic vibe of Japan that I think it would be a shame to miss whether you have crossed the Pacific to the real deal or not.*Parking garage rate is expensive, so find a street parking (perhaps a block away) for a more reasonable metered parking rate",jayyen93

While Little Tokyo can be experienced in about 2 days, what you will find will be eye opening. Many celebrations are held in the area throughout the year and all of them are colorful and/or fascinating. The cafes, clubs, restaurants and hotel dining sites can be as eclectic as one would think but as not as daunting for a first time diner who thinks all Japanese food is raw or unhealthy without first savoring various delicious options. Your senses will lead you to places your curiosity must explore. Don't miss the stunning Kyoto Gardens rooftop wedding venue with amazing skyline views at The Doubletree by Hilton Hotel.

The only downside is that its in downtown LA (traffic and far from everywhere).",CesarVe
50,A few good restaurants,"NOTHING like Tokoyo, and the same kind of disinterested service you find all over the US and Europe. There is a museum. I have not been in it. It is not a main LA attraction. The old streets around there have been cleaned up and modernized, and it is reasonably safe. It is on the fringe of the new artsy neighborhoods near the main produce market---strictly wholesale. I find the only reason to go there is food shopping---there is a fairly decent Japanese retail supermarket for foods you can't find at your local non-Japanese markets, and to go from restaurant to restaurant trying to find a great one. So far...no luck. Pretty standard fare at expensive sushi style prices.",anropn

There is a place called Japanese Village Plaza, where a lot of Japanese restaurants and shops with beautiful Japanese ornaments which immediately brings your feeling as if you were in Tokyo.You will be surprised that there are long queues at most of Japanese restaurants, it was also because when we reached there it was dinner time. Anyway, you could go to Little Tokyo Plaza on 2nd floor there is Zencu restaurant which quite big and still have more spaces and no queue...and the food itself is very nice for our standard (indonesian standard :-)) ... when we would like to go back to our hotel in Century City, we ask hotel Miyako (in this Little Tokyo area) very helpful Philippinos concierge staff to call a taxi for us.

Your cost is about $16 for 2 people.The ride is about 30 mins to downtown , the traffic was not bad. We walked from the Union Station to Little Tokyo with our carry-on size luggage. The walk is about 10-15 mins but I do not recommend to walk as you will be around a more quiet area ( we saw some homeless people but they didn't bother us)We had the Donburi, and Soba noddles at the village plaza. Then we had the traditional Japanese sweet from Fugetsu Do.Upon returning to Airport for our connection flight.

40,Small but interesting,"This is a fun little trip. When I say little, the footprint in Little Tokyo is quite small but that's a good thing because all fitness levels can enjoy it. The area is clean and relatively safe. There are many food offerings to be found and quite a few neat little shops. Most are tourist centric but the quality of items are fair to good. There is also a museum with various attractions that tour the location.-Parking is easy and this is a great location to visit with both day and night activities. I'd feel safe here at night...not so much in China Town which is just down the way. Keep in mind that the local Skid Row is close by so don't stray too far from the obvious location and as such, be ready for a crazy person or two. Check out the grocery stores, immaculate with some very cool offerings. One is a membership store (Marukai) and the other not. Real wasabi and matsutaki mushrooms that smell like cinnamon (and are super expensive). Also a little hardware store that is very Japanese centric, if you're into wood working, they have some amazing hand tools from Japan as well as good knives...Not a tourist shop, just a hole-in-the-wall locals type place. You can also stand in line for 2 hours for ramen at an over-hyped ramen house, or outsmart the ""fu-fu-foodies"" and enjoy the fine ramen offerings that surround it.-Over all, a satisfying afternoon.-",Johnny P

30,Not as good as what we thought,"We thought that it's ganna be an amazing experience to visit it, but it is literary just about a block... And if you went to time square before, little Tokyo is smaller than that...",itseng_angel
50,Lovely for some interesting shopping,"Little Tokyo is great if you are a fan of all things Japanese but aren't able to get there, there is a great supermarket filled with Japanese sweets and sushi and fun, exotic things. The shops are lovely with model kits, lots of kawaii bits and pieces and cosplay, and a Sanrio shop for Hello Kitty fans! The bakery in the middle was really nice too.",noddy99
40,Good only to eat,"There's not much to it in my opinion, except some exceptional eating place. Great ramen shops and local flavor places. Not much in terms of things to see or do. We did not have time for the Japanese American museum, so don't know about that.",ColoradoBuoy
50,"Nice, and cultural place","One of the best ethnic place in Los Angeles. Nice shops, and restaurants. Safe place to walk, specially for families.Instead of bar hooping I did a food hooping !!! I started in Kula (to the left in the main street), it was a belf with different kind of sushi and sashimi (raw fish), every plate at 2.25$ ... then I got fresh sushi at Nijiya Market (let me tell you something, you know that fish has to be eaten fresh, if the Japanese people get trays and trays of food in front of you, you can not be wrong). Good and cheap foodAnd finally got dessert, a sesame roll with sweet black beans inside. Really goodDefinitively a stop to make in LA",RuPell

40,japanese-ish,"Having recently been to Tokyo, Japan we were expecting some of the same culture here. - Well, not so much, but what we did find was a lot of japanese stuff.

50,Very special experience,"I love Little Tokyo! It gets crowded easily as it is so small, so I'd recommend going in the morning.

50,Good place to find food (Japanese and other),"I work east of Little Tokyo, and I occasionally drop by for lunch. All kinds of Japanese food, and prices are reasonable. There are two markets in the immediate area, Nijiya and Marukai, where you can buy bento lunch boxes and sushi to take out. 1st street and Central Ave have good ramen noodle shops. A conveyor belt sushi restaurant is in Japanese Village Plaza, near 2nd street. Try the mochi ice cream shop in the plaza.The neighborhood is changing. Besides Japanese food, I stop by the Subway sandwich shop on 2nd and Starbucks on Central. Mr. Pizza on 1st has Korean style pizza. Yogurtland is on Central. Korean food is available in the Little Tokyo Galleria at 3rd and Alameda.For Japanese souvenirs, I recommend going to Daiso in the Little Tokyo Galleria, at 3rd and Alameda St. Most items are around $1.50.The best time to experience Japanese culture is during Nisei week in August and New Year's activities in January.Also tucked away in Little Tokyo are a couple nice gardens. One is at the Doubletree Hotel at Los Angeles and 2nd St. Another garden is located at the Japanese American Culture & Community Center, at San Pedro and Azusa St.For visitors, Little Tokyo is a nice stop on the way to another activity. For locals, it's a great place to get good food and take a break.",GiantsFanLosAngeles

50,Japanese Flavor,"A little taste of Japan right in the heart of Los Angeles. I have been going to Little Tokyo since I was a child and now I take my kids. We eat Teriyaki in one of the restaurants and my daughter gets a kick out of eating with chop sticks and out of a Bento plate. Then we treat ourselves to Shaved Ice Cones for dessert, then we browse the many shops that have souvenirs, parasols, fans, etc. It's fun to visit during Nisei Week which falls this year on Aug 15 -23. All kinds of fun events are planned. Bonus is that it is walking distance from what is now considered L.A.'s Art District. Only negative is parking can be a challenge, but worth the day trip.",845beatriz

40,Very nice Little Tokyo that has a good mix of retail and restaurants,"Having been to all 3 (official) Little Tokyo's in the US (the other 2 being San Francisco and San Jose - all in California), this LA Little Tokyo certainly has a few things going for it.‚ñ† LA's LT has a good mix of retail, culture and restaurants as compared to SF's LT which I think has too many restaurants.‚ñ† There is an iconic tall red watch tower that marks LA's LT. When you see it, you know you're at the right spot. See my LA LT photos.‚ñ† Across from the tall red tower is the Japanese American National Museum for some history of the WWII Incarceration and other significant events related to Japanese-Americans. The Geffen Contemporary is just next door for some more contemporary exhibits and arts.‚ñ† For live culture, you have the David Henry Hwang Theater and the Aratani/Japan America Theater.‚ñ† My favorite Japanese supermarket, Nijiya, also has a branch here - go there to get affordable take-out sushi and other Japanese snacks. I bought a bag of Oreo Matcha (green tea flavored) soft cookies.‚ñ† There are quite a few parking garages around the area - some available for $5 all day parking. Some retail shops and restaurants will also validate your parking - assuming you park at the right garage.‚ñ† FYI, LA's LT is also where the popular California roll was created by chef Ichiro Mashita.In summary, if you're in the downtown LA area, walk down to Little Tokyo for some sushi and a sample of Japanese culture. It's a great spot to spend an hour or 2 in downtown LA..",Live4Sights
40,Hidden Treasure in Downtown LA,"What a treat it was for us t discover Little Tokyo. I was surprised by the bakeries -- didn't expect that.

50,Lovely place to walk in Downtown,"Little Tokyo is a really small district inside Downtown, but it is worth getting here if you want to relax a little from the hustle of downtown and see something else. Sushi places, Japanese shops, weird kids dressed in cosplay of their favorite magna characters, and old guy dressed as Pikatchu walking his dog... You never know what you may find in Little Tokyo.History buffs may also want to visit the astronaut Ellison Onizuka's monument in the street named after him near Weller Court, and sit on the bench alongside the memorial of Chiune Sugihara, one the ""Righteous Among the Nations"", who as a Japanese consul in Lithuania during the Holocaust composed over 6,000 visas against the wishes of his government to allow Jews to escape to Japan.",GameServer
40,Cute neighborhood and lots of Japanese shops!!,"What a great place to be!! Little Tokyo reminded me of Japan Town in San Francisco. If you walk around the blocks, you will find plenty of sushi houses and especially Japanese restaurants catering to BBQ. This seems to be a big hit here. There are also little shopping malls near the Double Tree by Hilton where they cater to Japanese goodies and grocery stores as well. I did pass by a few Kimono tailors in the area. If I had more time, this would be one of the places I would checkout.Until then, Cheers! ~ :p",Edwin R

Although there is an abundance of restaurants that you can pick from and it seems a bit over whealming but I really like that everything is so close. You can grab a beer and a little sushi and walk on over to a different spot and do the same. I have a few that are my favorite but I still keep exploring. There is also cute little stores that you can find some random things you never knew you needed :),h2opolo66

I make it a point to go to the grocery store here to buy some Japanese green tea because I haven't been able to find it anywhere else in the US The restaurants on 1st Ave are less crowded. I have also been to the Japanese American Museum.",Marta E
30,Niche and Touristy,"My partner was visiting from the UK, and I wanted to give her a taste of something different in Los Angeles. I thought Little Tokyo would be a great spot to enjoy an afternoon, and while we had fun, we weren't overly impressed.While I enjoyed the niche offerings, my girlfriend thought it was a little touristy. We both agreed that the quality of eateries wasn't exceptional, and the retail area geared more for visitors than authentically Japanese.There are some highlights, however. We both loved the Lette Macarons there, and the Japanese American Museum/Chado Tea Room were both in near walking distance. The parking is also fairly plentiful, however on the day we visited the elevators were not working, and we were one of many individuals struggling to find stairs leading back to our car.I wouldn't mind revisiting, but my partner is a little less enthusiastic about it.",Michael L

Whether you eat amazing food in one of the many great cafes, restaurants and shops, or see a play at East West PLayers, or tour the many museums- You won't be disappointed.

50,Unique and awesome place Hello Kitty,First of all I've been driving in Los Angeles 37 years transit buses and have seen Los Angeles build up to what it is now Little Tokyo is unique and an awesome place not only for the museums and the history all the sushi bars churches shopping and Fine Arts but when the convention of Hello Kitty comes >not town you gotta comeIt Gives you a really balanced vacation spot the Miyako hotel and Doubletree Hotel also the Kiwanda and the Omni hotels service these areas one of the only areas in Los Angeles that stays open till about 2 a.m. with a sushi bars and has a great nightlife just need to stay within the Little Tokyo area you have many homeless people and homeless shelters just past 3rd Street and the rest of the downtown pretty much disappears after 6 p.m. because of the government area around the Tokyo easy access from the red train from Hollywood Universal Studios get off at Civic Center station walk east 4 to 5 blocks and the Gold Line train from Union Station to Pasadena get off at first and Alameda st walk one block west and you are in Little Tokyo good luck if u need more info go to thetransportationgeneral.com for free transportation routes to Little Tokyo from most of the major cities,Robert C
30,"Small, but worth a look","Almost every city has a Chinatown, Greektown and Little Italy. Not so many have a Little Japan - oops, Little Tokyo. Why just one city? Anyway, the name doesn't matter.

Nothing to see inside but they have a beautifully maintained Japanese garden outside on a lower level not easily seen till you get right up to it.Tip: Park at the lot at 101 Judge J.

However since it was Sunday morning around 10.30am, many of the shops were not yet opened. So we walked around the neighbourhood, checked out the Japanese Village Plaza, the Japanese museum along East 1st Street. At about 11am, some of the shops opened.There were many restaurants and little shops in the area. Finally we decided to have an early lunch at Sushi & Teri. It was a small restaurant but the waitresses were friendly. I had the Chicken Teriyaki Special while my husband had the Caterpillar Roll which was actually an avocado sushi roll.

40,Dinner and short walk about after dinner,"It's a really small area but the vibe is good, I liked how the place looks with the round lanterns hanging above, the narrow alley that really gave it a jap feel.

Surprisngly lots to see and browse around, all sorts of shops and cafes. Plenty of restaurants which looked good too.Well worth a look if you've spare time.",rufford155

Even though they have a high rating on urban-spoon (90%+) they service was strange and slow (my server says she's never heard of urban-spoon) their food wasn't terrible, for example chicken yakitori tasted better than beef yakitori, but it was very expensive for the quality!They have parking available within the plaza which you can get validated. Personally I would not recommend this restaurant (Yakitori Koshiji).",Milkyway22

I love the people of the Japanese culture, their impressive manners, the simple clean decor and spotless landscaping. A bottle of warm sake really hits the spot on any day as far as I'm concerned, but might have been even a tiny bit more enjoyable right here in Little Tokyo!I adventurously tried some kiku (Japanese confection) and it was pretty darn tasty! Then sat back and watched the people go by in the town square garden area. I treasure all the pockets of different cultures sprinkled all over Los Angeles. Little Tokyo is a great place to visit!",Sally M
30,Nice and clean,I went to Little Tokyo on a Tuesday after going to Chinatown. It seemed to have a bit more people on that day compared to Chinatown.

20,High expectations left me disappointed!,"I was so excited to read reviews on Little Tokyo that I decided to schedule in a visit. I found the little ""village"" filled with touristy cheap gifts and mediocre resturants. There was a section, similar to a mini mall, that was closed on the day I was visiting. Apparently they only open one day a week. Which was strange for a shooping area. This place was not worth my time and energy. I found better Japanese resturants outside of little Tokyo that were clean, happening and good to eat! After spending 10 mins there, I decided to drive around to see if there was anything else to see. I even stopped into a couple of shops to ask sales folks if there was anything else to see. They gave me a blank stare and said ""this is pretty much it"". I did find a beautiful satin baseball jacket (vintage) with elaborate stitching that was totally worth my dime!!

40,Pleasant way to spend a day,"I was staying at the Miyako during a one-day layover in a trip between Texas and Hong Kong. This was a fun place to walk around and get a feel for Japanese history and culture.I started at the Little Tokyo Visitors Center where an elderly gentleman pointed out sights on a map. He was of Japanese descent, but had served in the US Army during WW2.Since it was Monday, the Japanese museum was closed. I mostly walked around temples and admired the well tended gardens. Easy to ""walking meditate."" Also looked in lots of shop windows. Didn't buy anything, because my suitcase was already too full.For lunch I had an excellent sushi and sashimi feast at Sushi Gen in Honda Center. For supper, I just found a grocery store and bought a few simple deli items since I wasn't really very hungry and had already blown my food budget for the day.The man at the visitors center said I could walk most anywhere in the daytime, but might run into bums and panhandlers at night if I strayed beyond 3rd street. I took his advice and had no problems.",ZhongguoKM

We decided to go after realize that after 6:00 PM Chinatown is almost death in a Friday evening. We walked to Japanese Village plaza mall just across the street from the metro station. It was a pleasant surprise to find a nice live Japanese type environment. Public karaoke in the center of the plaza, affordable Japanese handcrafts, and very good restaurants. We had a ramen soup perfect for a chilly evening in the terrace and just in front a very good coffee. Nice place to appreciate the rich ethnic diversity of L.A.",javmexplora

The clothing boutiques are omg affordable with the most adorable fashions and for the guys there's an amime place full of graphic novels and comics. Our favorite place to eat is Omasa, we've tried other places but that is our favorite. The museum is worth going to at least once as well because its a different side of the story then what the history books tell us. Give it a try!",missy B
50,A little bit of Japan,"Little Tokyo is for me and my family super cool. In some places it's like stepping back in time in Japan.

If you haven't been, you really must go!",Mika I
40,Fun area to spend some time at,"The area known as Little Tokyo in downtown Los Angeles is a fun area to spend some time at. The Japanese-American National Museum is in the area which makes it convenient to eat lunch and learn something about how the Japanese came to America. There are several different shops and restaurants in the few blocks that make up this area.While there are influences of Japanese culture and architecture, it is still ""Americanized."" However you will still find shops that are familiar to those you'd find in Japan selling Hello Kitty and other recognizable items. There are Japanese, Korean and American restaurants/cafes in which to choose from.If you are in the downtown area, it would be worth it visiting Little Tokyo to see a different side of the city, people watch and just enjoy yourself.",wbullseye

30,Little Tokyo Not the Same as Before,September 2012. Business required me to be in the Southland. I wanted to visit the Japanese American National Museum located in Little Tokyo. The last time I visited this classic Los Angeles Neighborhood was in January 2002. I found Little Tokyo to be not as nice during my visits in the 1980s' and 1990s'. Compared to San Francisco's Japantown which has seen new development and revitalized buzz since the 1980s' and 1990s'. The San Francisco Asian American Film Festival is heavly featured in S.F.'s Japantown in March of each year. Weller Court features many Japanese eatries and a small market.

It seems the number of stores are smaller then our last visit two years ago.We tried a shopping trip on a Saturday morning and our favorite store did not open until 10:30, kind of late for a supermarket. The other major stores also opened late and even at 11 AM there was hardly anyone around. On the other hand, like a previous visitor mentioned, we run into homeless people. It was our first time ever in the area and due to the low traffic we felt unsafe.We drove down to Gardena to visit the other major Japanese supermarkets, Mikawa and Marukai. The places were full of merchandise and people. We were able to buy the best quality green tea we eve had. For people trying to shop for oriental groceries and goods I recommend bypassing Little Tokyo and had to Gardena.",Peter A
50,A Touch of the Orient,"Little Tokyo is one of the many sections of Los Angeles with a concentration of people and businesses from a single country.

The restaurants are great and shops carry merchandise of every description. It's close to the Metro.",Kenneth L

The restaurants and everything aren't that authentic really, but it's still got sushi and little quirky japanese shops with the waving cats and stuff. Make sure to go to the shop that says 'ice cream and youghurt', it's in one of the corners but if you have a sweet tooth, it's seventh heaven. The museum is interesting if you want to learn about the culture. Some of the clothing is expensive, but the little bits and bobs like chopsticks and purses aren't.",Ollie T

By that time, we noticed that so many homeless people around the area. Thank God that we got warned.

Shout out to ma boy, Brian (asian tour guide), made our experience so much more memorable and fun! Our 2+ hours of non-stop action was packed with food, restaurants, history, and culture. We started off the day by touring cute little shops which have been around for many, many years, since little Tokyo was built in 1912?, trying yummy bakery goods and sweets. In total, we went to 5/6 restaurants/stores, and tried 7 to 8 different items that ranged from sushi, raw beef, gyoza, udon (best udon ive had), salad, rice and curry, curry donut, fried octopus, and sweet bread with red bean filling. Everything was mad tasty. We ended the day at chado tea house and sipped our way through many types of tea where I learned the raspberry tea is the best cure for PMS symptoms and the Lemon Mint Chamomile to knock you into bed. My favorite was the Podrea, which is made from jasmine, vanilla, and apricot. Yum yum. We also had sweet barkery goods such as fruit tarts and other desserts that sadly, i can't remember the names of.

Some of the shops sell overpriced junk and people in the stores can be very pushy to make you buy things you don't need or want. Be wary that this is a dilapidated neighborhood where a lot of homeless and weird people will beg for your money or ask for weird favors. Look after your wallets and purses or other valuables because some people are desperate for money. Ladies do not go alone because the weird people prey on women the most. Bring a buff guy with you to protect you. If you're looking for a bargain go to the bakery and the 98 cent store (I don't mean the 99 cent store there is an actual 98 cent store there). The store clerks speak broken english in there but it's a fun place to go. If you're looking for a kimono there's a place that starts with a weird Japanese S name Hollywood that has a great deals on kimonos. Don't forget to visit the town square for performances. They're awesome. Do go to the grocery store and buy some snacks..it's totally worth it! Bring lots of money but keep a close eye on it. Visit the cultural center on your way out. Trust me I'm one of the locals.",operajester
