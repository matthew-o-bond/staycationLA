30,Very small but friendly,"This is a tiny operation, but over an approximately two-hour period I saw the staff of two in action and was impressed by their patient helpfulness to patrons. I came in for a quiet place to read and write, but happened to sit at a table with a man who was apparently fond of constantly talking and laughing softly to himself, while wearing headphones. No mental illness there -- just garden variety rudeness. Unfortunately, the library is so small that there was no other table to move to, so I just soldiered on. It was great to see, though, the enthusiastic use by families of the kids' area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamm690
50,Quiet place to read and color with kids,"We stopped in here on a Saturday morning before hitting the beach. My kids colored for about thirty minutes and then we read for another twenty. We all benefited from some quiet, down time. It gave us a chance to read some old favorites as well as some new picture books. My children (ages 3 and 6) even wanted to check out some books.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R8109WMpaulac

50,Small But Effective,"Polite, professional librarians. Small space but good variety and reference. More than books, DVDs, music and more. If you need a special title or author it can be requested from the mainland library. Wifi and printing available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BluewaterGypsy
50,Small town library,"The library is small, but has some interesting books focused on Catalina, if you're looking to do a little research. Staff is helpful and friendly. There are usually used books and magazines for sale, if you need a little vacation reading material.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avalon2020
50,"fantastic branch library -- LA County residents, bring your cards!","Avalon has a population of about 3800 people -- for comparison, the town i live in, which is relatively ""small"" is 34,000 -- almost 10x bigger. Avalon gets about 3000 more people every weekend and on cruise ship days -- the island runs on tourism.however, it's still an incorporated city in L.A. County, and the people here need the same services as those living on the mainland -- which includes a library.now, you'd think that a tiny branch serving a tiny fraction of the population of L.A. County might be...tiny -- and this one is, but it is also quite mighty, especially if you're a kid. about half of the floorspace of the building is a children's section, with a great selection of books for all ages 0-12, and a pretty good choice of DVDs too. there are comfortable tables with stacks of coloring pages and loads of crayons & markers, and some floor puzzles too.what's in it for adults? quiet chairs, free internet, and several computer terminals. and of course, books. the staff is super friendly and very helpful, and there's homework help available.if you're a SoCal local vacationing on Catalina, remember to bring your County of Los Angeles library card, and enjoy this local spot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hadashi
