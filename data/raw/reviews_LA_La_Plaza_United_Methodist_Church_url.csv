40,To continue the Methodist tradition,"Now located in El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historical Monument, this church commenced its existence as the Bloom Street Medical Mission in 1910. Its mission was to continue the Methodist tradition of providing social services that included a free medical clinic staffed by volunteer doctors.This church is quite unostentatious within â€“ high ceiling with a small balcony, pews on either side of an aisle leading to a simple altar adorned with a large cross. However, it has two exquisite stained glass panels on either side of the altar.Without doubt, the piece de resistance is a huge stained glass image of Christ that reflects off a mirror right at the entrance steps of the church.After its lease ran out in 2011, the LA Plaza Methodist Church struggled to eventually get a fresh fifty- year lease from the City of Los Angeles. However, the renewal in 2011 came with the condition that the Methodist Church would educate El Pueblo visitors about its social justice heritage and offer a non-sectarian slate of exhibits and educational outreach. Thus fortuitously, was born the Los Angeles United Methodist Museum of Social Justice (please see my review of Los Angeles United Methodist Museum of Social Justice).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMenon
