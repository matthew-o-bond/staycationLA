30,LA Rubgy Sevens,"Extremely expensive stadium. We did not drive to the but I heard allot of people complaining about the cost of parking. The cost of drinks were ridiculous, but that's to be expected at a stadium. We were there for the Rugby Sevens and I must say I've traveled to allot of these Rugby Sevens events, this one was a disappointment . There is a very good chance that if the Rugby Sevens happens in LA at this stadium again...ALLOT of people will not attend.Also, I was not impressed with the staff. Specifically the ones at the southeast gate who were checking bags. You would have thought they were TSA at the airport, they gave my girlfriend such a hard time about her small bag.....the irony in all this..is that the Sheriff and some police officers were at the stadium and they talked to us before heading in and said my friends bag was ok.Also, at the end of the day we were waiting near a booth, my friends were waiting for a customized water bottle being made. The same staff (girls) at the southeast staff, came to my friends and told them that we had to leave. I don't know what is it about the staff of this stadium..what their problem is....but it was thoroughly disappointing. I even saw their supervisor giving other people a hard time. Relax girls...you don't work for Homeland Security.Anyway, will I be going back to this stadium....probably not. I'm hoping they will move the Rugby Sevens elswhere....move it back to Las Vegas....anywhere but Carson!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emz182
30,Rugby Sevens,"Expensive concessions, unhelpful staff. I needed guest services and was told “it’s somewhere down there” as she pointed down the concourse.Easy parking, every seat has a good view of field.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/277loiss
40,HSBC 7s Rugby,The location of the HSBC 7s rugby circuit stop. Expensive parking $30/day. Venue is nice and easy access. Slow security checkin but understanding. Standard Stadium food and beverage pricing. Seats were above average comfort. Restrooms were fairly clean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vegasrugbyref
30,Football game,The stadium is nice and because it is a smaller stadium you don’t get lost. The only thing I did not like was the parking fee is $60 and if you want to tailgate the parking fee is $100. The facility itself is nice though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ellens4506
30,Ok place to watch an NFL game,"This is a soccer stadium ,used by the LA galaxy , that also serves as the temporary home of the LA chargers while their new stadium is being completed. The stadium seats around 22,000 people which is small by nfl standards. But every seat has a close up view of the field.It’s an outdoor stadium which can get quite hot in September when I visited. Fortunately we were under shade so not too bad.Do not get seats in the end zone!!! There is no shade there, and no protection from the elements in that area.Facilities are pretty basic. Concession stands were a madhouse at halftime and extremely congested. Beers are very expensive. Not many restroom facilities. They were very crowded too.If taking an Uber, be prepared to walk. The pickup spot is at least a half mile walk to the southwest. Drop off point is a little closer but not by much.Fortunately, this is the chargers last year there. In 2020, they will be in their new stadium by LAX.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ciahasher
20,Tick the Box,"Took in the LA Galaxy v Toronto game on 4th July. Game was ok , stadium just ok, reasonably decent family atmosphere. Very expensive for a Bud. Getting into the ground was quite difficult as it’s not got the best signposting",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lambretta101
50,LA Galaxy game,We went to an LA Galaxy game last night and had a great time! We loved the atmosphere and the ticket price was extremely reasonable for where we were sitting! We paid less than $100 each with taxes and fees and were sitting in the second row on the end in the middle of the stadium. It was very easy to find our seats. There were plenty of bathrooms and concessions so we never had to wait in a line. The only thing I wish that they’d made more clear was that you can only bring in a purse of a very small size or a bag made out of clear plastic. We had to run around the stadium to put my purse in a locker.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/819akiras
40,Soccer Game in Section 140,"Arsenal vs Bayern München friendly match at Dignity Health Sports Park, so we went with “cheaper” seats in section 140. Section 140 is assigned bench seats unlike the other areas with individual seats, but they still had a decent view of the field. As noted in another review, the stadium has gone to a clear bag policy and you will be turned away with bags that do not meet the guidelines. I would recommend checking the stadium’s webpage before attending. I can’t comment on parking as we stayed at a Hampton Inn about a mile away from the stadium and walked to the game. We were a little unsure about the walk back to the hotel as the game was getting out at around 10pm, but it was fine. There was a sizable security presence along Avalon Blvd and a number of people walking back to the hotel. I have been to numerous Soccer stadiums and have no complaints regarding the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Assuretta
10,Bayern Munich vs. Arsenal,"This place is disgusting. I'll probably never attend an event there again. I've been to events with over 100K in attendance and the parking was worse in Carson with 26K. There is no organization getting people in and out of the place. It was halfway through the 1st half before we could get into the stadium and it wasn't because we left late.We had general admission tickets in the mezzanine and the seats were full. They had tarps over several places up there and we were standing below the scoreboard. A woman came along to tell us we needed to find a seat and my daughter said, ""Where?"" She told us there was a general addmission area on the other side, but that mentality shows the lack of quality in the overall operation in Carson.The whole place is not ready for prime time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lonnyrowden
50,Home of the LA Galaxy,"There is not a bad seat in the house at DHSP. You get a great view of the game wherever you sit. The north side has zero shade, so if it is a day game in hot temperatures, you might want to consider another section. Plenty of food options at standard stadium prices (not cheap, but no stadium has economical food).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wenders1022
20,Communications (or lack thereof) made for a frustrating experience,"A frustrating experience attending LA Galaxy this weekend. We’ve come to this stadium periodically over the last 10 years, but today’s visit set a bad tone. Pretty sure there was another event happening at the same time at CSUDH, probably graduation. Multiple parking lots were not available for Galaxy parking and there was zero signage advising who was supposed to park in which lot. Pulling into the main lot finally, it sure would be helpful and potentially aid traffic flow to have clear signage as you are pulling in as to the cost of on-site parking.Not sure how long their bag policy has been in effect, but we’ve never been turned away from the gate due to a purse or small bag. My wife condensed her purse to a very small pocket size bag (about 5 inches by 4 inches). We were turned away due to a no bag policy. Apparently you can bring in a bag if it is clear. Again, coming here for ten years (though we didn’t hit a game last season), but never ran into this policy before. I had to run to our car (as my other option was to put it in a locker – for 10 bucks, no thanks). By the time I got back and we got through the gates, we had missed the first 10 minutes of the match.My seat had a slight visual obstruction – would have been helpful for the ticket seller (in this case Stub Hub) to have that identified as I would have paid more for a seat without any visual obstruction.Music choices pre/post game and intermission not our cup of tea. And by far the loudest PA system of any stadium we’ve been to in recent memory (this counts numerous Southern California stadiums as well as others throughout the state and Western U.S. in our recent travels). So loud where we were my wife was putting her fingers in her ears. I play in a rock band as well, so for me to complain about the decibel level is saying something.While I generally love the vibe in person at sporting events, this one left me thinking I would have had a better time just tuning in on television. Making the drive from Ventura County is a time commitment. We are long time Galaxy fans, but experiences like this will weight on decisions of future frequency of attending events here.On the plus side, the staff we encountered were all friendly and courteous to a fault, even as they had to be the bearers of bad news as in our gate entry experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/artdob
