50,"Venue for ""Celebrate Israel""","We came here for to Cheviot Hills Park for the ""Celebrate Israel"" 67th Anniversary (we also came here 2 years ago for the 65th Anniversary. The park was a great venue for the celebration. There were several parking lots within a few block charge $6 to park for the day with Shuttle busses to drop off/pick up running regularly. The security had the park was aplenty and did a great job as there were no problems that I know of. The music/bands could be heard all through the park without having to sit and listen. The area was beautiful and appeared to be safe as well. It was an excellent event and we will be attending next year too!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/la123brat
40,Beautiful park and neighborhood,"I've always loved Rancho Park -- it has a nice mixture of athletic facilities (several tennis courts, baseball diamonds and basketball courts, adjacent golf course and driving range, swimming pool); it's a pleasant place for a picnic (though maybe not as nice as the more manicured Roxbury Park); and most of all -- it is in the midst of a great neighborhood for a walk. Cheviot Hills has some of the prettiest streets and lovely homes in suburban LA (not including the neighborhoods with mansions -- which are just pretentious and unfriendly areas), and it's smack in the middle of West LA. I highly recommend to anyone who needs a little exercise -- go with a friend, or a dog, or some chill music, and take a long (one hour+) walk around Rancho Park and the surrounding Cheviot Hills neighborhood. It's relaxing and pleasing. Plus, you get to see the streets where Modern Family is shot. ..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/914bj
