50,Very nice place,"Whether you want to jog or just casually walk, this is an excellent place. There are paths that crisscross the park so you're not limited to just the perimeter. There are also enough uphill sections to keep it interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ANTHONYU465
50,Very Peaceful Park,"This park is very peaceful in the middle of a big city. There is a lot of grass to play on, and even a train that goes around the park! There is a walking trail that circles the park. Near the playground, there is a tree house that kids can play on! The duck pond was drained, but as California is in a major drought I can understand why it was drained.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jtaylorxc
40,A very nice place to enjoy out of doors,"There id plenty of good parking unless the out door market is working. Plenty of places to have out door parties, and picnics, and plenty of things for young children to do. A very nice walkway to exercise, with level and some elevation to the walkway. There is 4 very nice ball parks that are also lighted for night games. And plenty of shade trees to get out of the sun.

Bonus after walks on Tuesdays and Saturdays with the Farmers' Market in the park's parking lot. Best Farmers' Market around. Fruits, vegetables, pastries, coffee and the excellent food court. A go to place in the South Bay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/829ronm
30,Good park for big gatherings and exercise,"Like most of Torrance, there is a lot of concrete and its not as green as other areas like Pasadena. But, it is a good park that has many uses: tennis courts, basketball courts, soccer fields, softball fields, a rec center, and a cement sidewalk perimeter that people use for walking path. The lake that was in the park has been drained and is an eyesore. The best thing about this park is its central location: for example there is a Tuesday and Saturday Farmers Market, as well as the fact that there are shuttles to the Hollywood Bowl from the parking lot here. There is a Starbucks, Lees, Subway and JJ Bakery within walking distance if you are too lazy to pack a picnic.Also, there are lot of picnic tables for company picnics or big family reunions. Unfortunately there are no bungalows to shade you really like in some other big parks I have seen in Orange County (i.e. Mile Square Park).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunnyDTraveler
30,Good Torrance Park but Needs More,First of all the picture is deceiving; I have not seen a lake in Wilson Park. If there ever once was one then I guess it dried up. Wilson Park is a big park but it is a little disappointing because I feel more could be done with it to make it even more attractive. There seems to be so much wasted space where I think things could be added to make it more enjoyable. But then that is my opinion; I am sure others probably like it just the way it is.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Metrotorrance
40,Grassy space for all,"Wilson Park is a great place for all ages. It's fairly huge and great for walks with children and dogs. It's almost 1 mile all the way around with very little elevation change. There are ample basketball courts and several tennis courts that are always (ALWAYS!) full with people waiting.The park has a lot of green, grassy areas - with a couple of baseball fields. There are a few sandboxes where kids can swing and slide.They also have a farmer's market in the parking lot on Saturday mornings, so you can make a half-day out of it and not have to bring any food.Overall, I think this is the best park in Torrance. There's lots of room to do plenty of things, including a little outdoor R&R.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/800MartinG

40,"Wilson Park in Torrance, CA has every thing for a fun day outside","I walk to Wilson's park from my home, which is not too far and helps me get more steps for my 10,000 daily step minimum. I visit Wilson Park for their walking trail which is .91 miles once around. Walking around the tree-laden parks you get to observe all of the fun things that are going on in the park. People bike riding, children rolling on any and everything that has wheels. There are a plethora of sports activities available in Wilson Park; tennis courts, basketball courts, baseball diamonds, a baseball pitching caged area, an indoor roller hockey rink and a center where martial arts is taught. Sometimes there are individualized training practices also going on in the park. All the different people who walk, ride, exercise and picnic in the park always entertain me. Yes there are picnic tables with charcoal grills to use if you are good with grilling food. There are signs up that say first come is in accordance with the park’s policy but also strongly suggest that you sign-up and reserve a spot if you are planning a family reunion, birthday party, wedding, baby shower, or a super fun time in Wilson Park. In Wilson Park’s parking lot on Tuesday’s and Saturdays there is the best Farmer’s Market in the South Bay area. Wilson Park is also where the buses leave for the Hollywood Bowl concerts. I rode one of those buses and it was the coolest and smartest way to travel to the Hollywood Bowl, I had a great time and my evening was absolutely perfect. I didn’t have to worry about being in traffic and paying a fortune to park in or close to the Hollywood Bowl. Wilson Park has every thing except a pool, but hey, we live so close to the Pacific Ocean, which is just fifteen minutes away, I think Wilson Park has everything you could possibly want for a fun day out doors in Torrance, CA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lolal323
50,Around Wilson Park twice and I've got my daily hour of exercise!,"Wilson Park is a lovely park with wide lawns and Eucalyptus trees over-head. The are several pathways for walking and many of the areas residents and visitors use the park for exercise and for rest. There are rises in the walking path that allow the walker to build up a sweat. There are baseball diamonds and horseshoe pits as well as a nice area of tables and bbq facilities that can be reserved.My walking buddy and I walk twice around the park and that's our hour for fitness in a beautiful and interesting setting, and close to several Torrance neighborhoods! Dogs may be walked in the park leashed and of course owners are required to pick up any messes. There are City basketball courts indoors and courts outdoors for pickup.

It's a great place for jogging & taking walks. Not a dog park, dog owners can walk their dogs but they MUST be leashed. Great park for birthdays, family reunions etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/358stevem
50,Family-Friendly Park,"A family-friendly park that's loaded with amenities: reservable picnic areas, softball diamonds, & indoor sports center; basketball, sand volleyball, & horseshoe courts; paddle tennis & tennis courts; tree house; children's playground; (duck) pond; batting cages; roller hockey rink; clean restrooms (the ones outside of the main facility does not have doors on their stalls other than the handicap ones :-O); & home to the Southern CA Live Steamers & Torrance Certified Farmers Market.It's a great place for jogging & taking walks (if you walk the whole park, it's 0.91-mi.), which you often see family & friends doing every day of the week. We tend to take evening/after-dinner walks to relax & get those ""extra steps"" in, but I feel fairly comfortable going on my own due to the large number of people out in the evenings - weekdays & weekends. =)While it's not a dog park, dog owners can walk their dogs but they MUST be leashed, especially with all the little ones running around... though some of the kids may need leashing of their own. :-XI would have given 5 stars if these incidents can be lessened... some parents think that they can let their child(ren) run wild because it's a park. Barely out of my arm's reach, my daughter had run-ins because these kids are out of control & speeding on their bikes/scooters, running around with a sharp stick (twigs/branches from the park's trees), throwing sand, etc. so now I'm more of a helicopter mom. Kids will be kids, but some are more socially advanced/well-behaved than others, which I think is reflective of how the parents teach them. It's not a frequent occurrence... but I've seen these uncontrollable little boys (usually the same ones), & some times little girls, running around with sticks, then poking other kids in their faces & bodies, or pushing the kids off the slides & swings, throwing sand at the other kids; the culprit's guardians/parents are nowhere to be seen until the victim's parent(s) are trying to locate them. Monitor/control your child, it would make the park a more pleasant experience for all if I don't have to ""hover"" over my child to protect her from yours.Families & friends can enjoy the a free ride (donations are welcomed) on the Live Steamers on the 1st Sunday from 11:00 AM - 3:00 PM, & 3rd Saturday from 12:00 PM - 3:00 PM. You can even reserve a train for your birthday party if you provide them with advanced notice (a donation is highly recommended since you're also cutting ahead of the line).And lastly, the Farmers Market is held every Tuesday & Saturday. If you can make it, Tuesdays are better shopping days; it's not as crowded & sometimes the farmers are more willing to negotiate especially around closing time. Once I got a box of grapefruit (16 pcs.) for the price of 3 because he probably didn't want to pack up the remaining fruit. They'll also have more time to chat with you - I get a heads up on upcoming/available produce so I can buy them at the height of the season. My favorite stands are: Ken's Top Notch Produce (Reedley, CA), Arnett Farms (Fresno, CA), Mark Boujikian Farms (also Fresno & once in awhile they'll advertise a ""happy hour"" & discount their produce). Or if you're just hungry, you can get anything from crepes, kettle korn, & potato-on-a-stick to breakfast burritos, fried rice, & pupusas, or try a refreshing cup of fruit lemonade.There's a l'il something for everyone...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatzKorner
50,"Active, safe, dog & family friendly","I've gone to this park for years and it only gets better. Dog friendly (on leash), kids play area, gym with league/team sports, baseball fields, basketball courts, picnic area, farmer's markets on Tuesdays and Saturdays in the mornings. (They used to have a Fourth of July fireworks celebration, that I wish they'd bring back.) Overall, an excellent large park and well worth visiting. There's also a Starbucks just around the corner if you like morning strolls with a latte. I think it's the most ""active"" park around, so it's a great place for a jog where you're surrounded by like-minded people. Each lap is just under a mile so you can easily track your distance and progress. It does get really busy when there are events there (like farmer's markets), so plan ahead to allow extra time for parking and traffic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vuladams

50,Always something to watch,Recently I've been walking at Wilson Park a few days a week. It's almost a mile around (.91) and much of it is shaded. The cement path is flat around the perimeter except for one small section. But you can switch it up easily by taking one of several paths in between. The Farmers Market is there every Tuesday and Saturday and always has great food and produce. And I love to feed peanuts to the very friendly squirrels!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janad63

Oh and the Farmer's Markets too, just remembering...been a while!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FO19
40,"A Huge Local Park, Very Popular With Locals","Other reviews I have seen here describe the park very well. I might add:There is a very popular paved walking path around the perimeter of much of the park. It is 0.91 miles around according to a sign. Popular with people like me, who just walk around it for exercise, joggers, dog walkers, and occasionally the local firefighters who exercise there. I like to go Tuesday or Saturday mornings when the farmers' market is there, and I can extend my walk to perhaps 1.5 miles.Large pond, with many picnic tables around it. I used to enjoy viewing the fish and turtles various residents contributed informally, but the city got rid of those attractions and now it is just clear water with a cement bottom. No wading, either. Still pretty.Sheltered roller hockey rink used for children's sports, with outdoors baseball batting cages, and adjacent former skateboard park that wore out and was torn down, now use for various things.A relatively new gymnasium and activity building that looks well used. An old Pacific Electric streetcar (important to Torrance's early history) theoretically being restored, but after an early attempt at that, now sits mainly forgotten but still on display.A large area ""owned"" by the South Bay Live Steamers Club (name uncertain), who give free miniature train rides a couple times a month.At least four amateur softball parks, also used for soccer.A ""treehouse"" for children, not climbable, but open to anybody to just stroll out and around it.Lots of free parking that only fills up on special days. This and a few very old buildings are a direct legacy from the original military parts depot that formerly occupied the site.This used to be the site of the city's extremely popular Old Fashioned 4th of July picnic, drawing perhaps 50,000 people, culminating in the city's great fireworks display. The City Council stopped giving its citizens this wildly popular and much needed picnic and fireworks at the last budget crunch. With today's improving economics, it is time to reinstate this gift to its citizens.All told, this is a very popular, unpretentious park with a lot to offer everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rendahl
40,Dr. Phil's Getaway,"Wilson Park is a rather large acreage of quite, rustling trees, fountains, baseball diamonds, soccer areas, picnic / barbeque section, bike paths and walking paths, all rolled up into a couple hundred acres, smack dab in the middle of Torrance. On both Tuesday and Saturday mornings comes the wonderful large Farmer's Market, chock full of fresh vegetables and fruits from all over the area, along with a food court and specialty merchants with bakery goods, gourmet cheeses, varietal honeys, fresh cut flowers, plants, trees, knick-knacks, etc. The feeling at both the Park and the Farmers Market is relaxed, friendly, unassuming and everyone is always very well behaved... almost European in feeling, and yet folks come and visit from all ethnicity.One can jog, fast walk, slow walk, play baseball or soccer, or just lay in the grass and meditate, read or even catch a cat-knap.

Oh my goodness what a lovely surprise! We happened to be there on a Saturday morning when the Farmers Market was going on which only added to our delight! Before strolling and shopping the market we walked the sidewalk path tracing the circumference of the park and were amazed at it's size (there was a sign that said it was .91 miles around) and scope of available activities (tennis, large expanses of lawn, the walking/jogging path, play structure, and more!). There were also lots of squirrels which were actually quite entertaining! Everyone we encountered was friendly and we were impressed at how many people were using the park. We really enjoyed the variety of produce available at the Farmers Market! There were many specialty Asian vegetables and fruits that we had never seen before! There were also food vendors at the far end and tables to sit down and eat. The market stalls were well laid out in a long oval so that you could walk down one side and then back on the other and not miss a thing! (We were told that there is also a smaller market here on Tuesdays and Thursdays at the same time -- 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM.)

There is also a walking path (cement) that you can walk the circumference of the park (about .9 miles per lap), so if you are out of town and need to exercise, this place is safe to do, but like any place, be aware of your surroundings. As a woman, I would only do these walks in the afternoons when others are doing the same thing. It is a large enough park that the back can not be seen from the street, so its best to walk during the day. The paths are kept clean and during the softball season, the walkway are lit up, otherwise, they are dark at night. Saturday and Tuesday mornings are farmer's market days, so its a great place for breakfast too!
