50,Wonderful to see Renee Fleming,"We looked forward to the Light in the Piazza presentation, primarily a unique opportunity for us to see Renee Fleming. And we weren’t disappointed.In the great auditorium, part of the inestimable Music Centre, it was a captivating storyline with accomplished performers. Acoustically it was delightful.Definitely a most enjoyable evening's entertainment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
30,Old & Tired,"The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, is like faded TV star from the 60s/70’s. Lacking the character of the Pantages, or the glitz of her younger sister Disney, Dorothy has clearly seen better days.Located a stone’s throw from skid row and surrounded by courthouses, Dorothy is in a great location if you are up for arraignment. Not so good if you want to enjoy an evening on the town.Bustling during the day, the area turns into zombie movie set at sun down. Normal people have vanished, replaced by shuffling zombies creating a palpable air of dread. After the show your only choice is to drive away to more appealing environs for that after show snack or aperitif.Inside it is too hot/too cold, making it impossible to dress fashionably and remain comfortable for the show. The acoustics are poor. Operas sound muffled and everything looks like it was created by the set designers of 70’s made for T.V. movies.The piece de resistance is the claustrophobic, neon lit underground maze, a.k.a. the parking structure. More confusing than catacombs, you quickly become disoriented by the twists and turns. Good luck finding an exit from neon Hades if you are cutting it close on time for your show. And god help those who forget where they parked. They will be wandering around for days waiting for rescue by spelunkers or high tech billionaires.The only reason to visit Dorothy is to see a special show. If another venue available, it is a far better choice than this faded polyester and rayon dream.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcfitch
50,One of the Very Best Venues,"You could see any time of event at the Dorothy Chandler. We have seen plays, concerts, small stage productions, and excellent symphony orchestra performances here.

50,Opera,The Light in the Piazza is a wonderful opera with an outstanding cast and interesting set decoration. The music from the orchestra is just lovely. The auditorium is beautiful as well as the entrance into the auditorium. Prior to the show there was a one hour introduction to the play with the conductor.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Romance2016
50,Music and Dance...,"We attended a performance at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on a Saturday night. A drive of nearly two hours up the 405Freeway. For those of you in Orange and LA County, you know exactly what this is. As for all you others, six lanes, each way, of traffic moving very slowly at times if at all. We knew this before we left home and arrived for dinner at Kendall’s on time. Walked back to the venue and were seated for the 7:30 performance. This was a combination of two companies, one The Royal English Ballet, the other Company Wayne McGregor. Composer and Conductor was Thomas Ades. Ades had always wanted to try to write music for Dante’s “Divine Comedy”. So this was a tiny bit of the journey through “Inferno” in 13 scenes, performed as a 45 minute continuous dance. It was thrilling, with lighting and music rising and lowering along the journey to HELL. We were really lucky to have in the row in front of us one of the Artistic Directors of the Royal Ballet. Giving us programming notes as we went along. 33 dancers, giving it there all. What a wonderful performance and night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/citronjimmerz
50,The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion Remains An Elegant Venue,"I saw Joni Mitchell – the peerless songstress in her body of work – come and get her birthday cake at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion last November. The audience was treated to a rare sighting of this beautiful spirit on the second night – of two evening concerts – that paid tribute to her kind of genius.Graham Nash has been quoted about writing songs in the house he shared with Joni Mitchell back in the late 60’s, early 70’s. He said, “From the moment I first heard her play, I thought she was a genius. I’m good at what I do, but genius?”Projected onto a giant screen were photographs, artwork and film footage of a young to aging Mitchell – as the impressive line-up came to honor her work spanning across 19 studio albums: Emmylou Harris, Norah Jones, Chaka Khan, Kris Kristofferson, Seal, Graham Nash, James Taylor, Diana Krall, Rufus Wainwright, Glen Hansard, Brandi Carlile and Los Lobos and a lot of musicians.On the surface the upscale event at a fancy venue was larger than that – it was to gather musicians to tell a story or send a message that was straight out of the tradition of Woodstock – a festival Mitchell never attended but wrote the hit song about.Brandi Carlile was alongside Kris Kristofferson in a duet. It wasn’t perfect – it was real. Kristofferson has suffered his own health issues in recent years and when he came striding out with guitar in hand he looked over and said, “What key are we in, is it D?” Carlile deftly guided him into their rendition of A Case of You.This tribute to Mitchell gave all the Joni-esque moments and reminders with an uneven but truthful ride back to her roots – Vietnam, Dylan, when the folk-smiths were the freedom criers… The fights that were fought that we’re still fighting to remind us that the kids need to see and hear these musical pioneers from that time or “Freedom’s just another word for nothin’ left to lose…” To Mitchell’s reminder in Big Yellow Taxi –Don’t it always seem to goThat you don’t know what you’ve got til it’s goneThey paved paradiseAnd put up a parking lotThey say Joni Mitchell will be remembered for “songs that are the most sublime paintings of the landscapes of human emotions ever created.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EMFredric

50,Excellent facility!,"Was at the recent Joni Mitchell birthday celebrations [both nights Nov 6 & 7]. The hall is huge and the sound is very good. More than average room between rows so it is comparatively easy to pass by others to get to your seat. After the show on Nov 7, attended the birthday dinner in a very large, well-outfitted room upstairs (how big is this place?!).

40,A nice place but I won't be back,"I know a lot of people like this place but I'm not one of them. I recently went there to see the Opera ""Carmen"". I had good seats and t was a Thursday so I thought it wouldn't be crowded. Big mistake! There was a long line of cars waiting to get into the parking garage and people had been waiting so long that there was a lot of cursing and horn honking. Once I got in and paid the $9 parking fee it was so crowded I had to park a long way from an elevator and when I got to it, there was a line of people waiting to get on. I had to wait for the third time it showed up until I was able to get in and found my seat (third row from the front in the balcony) I settled into a chair so uncomfortable that my knees were touching the one in front of me. I'm barely 6 feet tall and I wonder how anyone taller would even be able to sit there. Then the opera started. The sets were beautiful and so were the costumes, but everything else was sub-standard. Especially the acoustics. There was no 'fullness' to the music, the action on stage seemed wooden and the voices seem thin. I won't be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Banerman

50,Still Stunning After All Its Years,"I have never been to this renowned music center before and when we walked in, felt like Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz! Wanted to click my heels 3x to see if it was real. .....It is so beautiful a place. What a treasure it is in LA. We saw Tosca with Sondra Radvanovsky (sp) in the title role. She was so good she brought tears to my eyes. The tenor was equally magnificent. What a night in such a beautiful setting. The performance was world-class and I shall always remember it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grandoldgirlb

40,Still providing a good venue for shows,"We visited the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion when we watched the play ""Shen Yun."" The show was great with colorful and elaborate Chinese costumes, dancing skills and other theatrical moves. There was an almost seamless transition from the stage play to the video graphics in the background when characters flowed from the stage to the screen and back. Although the building was constructed some decades ago, it still gracefully lived up to its expectations of providing a venue for stage plays. We bought tickets for seats at the Founder's circle which were quite comfortable and of good value.as far as viewing is concerned.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fred1021
40,Difficult for elderly but gorgeous,"Sadly, we did not know how to approach the building. best to call the box office and speak to a person to get the right way to drive up and drop off your elderly arts patron. We did drive around in the swirling madness of LA traffic - added stress. Then we did not know about the driveway with plaza level drop off but did find the street level next to it so the elder could walk without stairs or hills. Its built on a hill and is a very very awkward place filled with stairs and different levels to the point of being dizzying. Old structure and is not very safe nor accessible. There were tons of elderly but use caution as the balcony is very steep and handrails totally inadequate; very steep pitch. This is not a relaxing place to take an elder. We saw the LA Opera perform. Bathroom lines moved well, staff fantastic, acoustics ok. Very pretty and inspiring views, plaza and interior. Bring binoculars!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IrishGermanSwedish
40,Throwback glamour,"We saw the LA Opera's production of Macbeth here, which we enjoyed very much. The building is like a time capsule from the late 60s/early 70s in a great way - very grand in scale with lots of fun period details. Do yourself a favor and splurge on tickets in the founders' circle/grand circle on the second level. You can relax at the oval bar and preorder drinks for intermission, and the bathroom line is a bit more manageable than downstairs. Seats are wide and plush too - extremely comfortable. The view is not right up front of course but it's worth the trade offs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmfesq
20,Surprisingly Amateurish,"We went to see the Opera Norma and were highly disappointed with the performance. If you are looking for a western version of NY's Lincoln Center, you will not find it here. This show was a poor second to NY. The singing was not first rate and the costumes and scenery were disappointing. We would have been better off listening to a CD. As for the hall, the best thing about it was the underground parking adjacent to the hall and the restaurant next door (reviewed separately). We sat in the first row balcony and immediately experienced claustrophobia because we did not have adequate room for our feet. We left at intermission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tradeesq

All three buildings are lovely and the plaza has a fountain, sculpture, outdoor seating for drinks and food and fantastic views of Downtown Los Angeles.

The building is gorgeous, the staff were helpful and friendly, and the production was stunning, with great performances by Patricia Racette, Christopher Maltman, and special guest Patti LuPone.

50,World Class Opera Performances,"This is the home of the L.A. Opera, one of several performance halls which make up the L.A. Music Center complex. Constructed on a berm above Grand Avenue, when programs are occurring, this plaza is a wonderful place to enjoy pre-performance social activities and eats. Come early to see what I mean. The DCP primarily shows opera, with the season pretty much covering the Fall-Spring months. Single tickets are often available at the box office the day of performance, especially for mid-week evening and weekend matinees. If you're new to opera, you might want to arrive an hour prior to the performance time to attend a lecture on the 2nd level. When I was there, James Conlon, the conductor, offered the lecture about the Figaro Trilogy. If you sit up above, bring binocs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zoom_Gotti
50,Dorothy Chandler Christmas Celebration 2014,We went here on 12/24/2014 after reading about the event on timeout.com and reviews on Yelp.The event started at 3:00 pm and lasted until 6:00 pm. Event and parking were free which is absolutely amazing for something in Los Angeles.The parking structure had event helpers who were directing the crowds for open spots-quite similar to the organization in Disneyland/Disneyworld. We reached the location at 2:15 and there was already a huge queue but we did manage to get seats. There were event assistants everywhere guiding people to their seats and answering all questions.The event was aired live on TV and on pbssocal.org. Performances were awesome-ranging from choirs by school kids to music orchestra to multicultural dances exhibiting the diversity of Los Angeles. Very enjoyable for the entire family!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/284ushak
40,classic mid-century -- could use a facelift,"11.6.2014 - LA Opera: ""Dido & Aeneus/Bluebeard's Castle""The crystal Chandeliers are stunning! It seemed about the only elegance left in this aging mid-century establishment. It really could use fresh carpets and a lick of paint. As is the muddy brown carpet looks so drab and depressing. The bathrooms downstairs feels like a dungeon.As for the Opera -- the stage was too crammed for that large chorus to prance around in. Watching Dido die was tedious. What happened to editing? Too much is still too much and an overkill!The same principles applies to ""Bluebeard's Castle"" too. The bloody scenes were so drawn out, it crossed over to gratuitous violence. That is so unnecessary. Very young children and elderly audiences who can't stomach gratuitous violence.Note: Rush tickets for Seniors are 50% off with IDStudents must show proof of current class schedules to get $25 rush tickets",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3Kells

50,Wonderful operahouse,"I am very fortunate to have seen numerous operas here. While the building itself may not compete with the more glamorous opera houses of the world, but we get operas to rival the best. With Placido Domingo as the General Director (and he usually plays at least one role per season) and James Conlon as the Music Director, the productions here are massive. We started going because the prices are actually reasonable in the balcony. They are also flexible with the exchange of season tickets. I appreciate that they bring in both traditional and avant garde shows. The location is great for Angelenos because it is actually accessible via the Metro. There is ample parking also, but beware that traffic usually gets bad when all of the site of the Music Center let out around the same time. After the Opera, we love to go to Pacific Dining car for their late-night menu, which is not too far.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexisd716

It's right off of HWY 101 which is great! Parking is easy to figure out. The food options outside is great, plenty of legroom, restrooms on each level, etc.I saw ""Thais"" with Placido Domingo on June 1, 2014 and he was wonderful! Nino Machaidze is horrific. I have never heard such an annoying voice in my life. It's like ""someone please catch that stray cat!"". I almost always like the female soprano but not this time. She has no warmth and no character in her voice. She has a long way to go. But in spite of her, I still enjoyed the Opera. I plan on seeing ""La Traviata"" in September even though Nino Machaidze is in that also. I'll have to bring ear plugs for her parts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Backpacker_0905

Unfortunately, by the time we fly in and find a hotel (even at Jerry's) we only feel like we can afford the cheap seats. The chairs are a little narrow up there in opera glass country. Might have to open the wallet a little next time. Check if there is a pre-show lecture - worth the time and you might get closer parking in the garage.

50,LA Opera's Carmen - WOW,"I cannot visit L.A. without going downtown to attend LA Opera at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. This gorgeous music center, with it's fountains; chandeliers; Tony Duquette design, is just gorgeous. LA Opera's ""Carmen"", with top tenor Tiago Arancam was spectacular; not an empty seat in the entire hall.....we had front row seats right behind the conductor, which allowed us the MOST fantastic views of this gorgeous Bizet masterpiece, as well as seeing the intensity on each stars face AND watch the symphony right below, in front of us. It was a divine evening - made even more divine by strolling through the Music Center Plaza on a perfect Friday night. Being friends with Tony Duquette's protege' allowed me to introduce my friend to this incredible venue;and tell her the history of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. If you are visiting the L.A. area, do contact the opera and see this archetectural wonder (which is as relevant today as when it was designed nearly 50 years ago....) and enjoy the BEST opera company in the US, headed by none other than Placido Domingo!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cleopatra561
50,Treat yourself to a mid-week show,"I've lived in LA all my life and never been to an opera until this past Tuesday night. Carmen was presented and the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion I decided that after a stressful the best thing to do is to enjoy a night at the theater. I got there at 5:30 for a 7:30 showing, parking was super easy. $9 to part and the best spot is the 4th level right in front of the escalator sign. I went upstairs to the plaza and sat in front of the beautiful fountains taking in the marvelous of LA. It is a beautiful city when you are not in your car and sitting in traffic. There is a restaurant on the plaza level but I though a $5 Subway sandwich would be just fine (brought it from the lobby of my office building). I bought a glass of wine for $10 to go with my sandwich and sat right outside the DCP underneath a shady umbrella. The doors opened at 6pm and I had the whole place to myself. I walked around, took pictures, used the facilities and then the biggest treat of all. I attended a pre-performance chat with Placido Domingo. The Grand Hall filled up rather quickly so I was glad that I got there so early. My sister joined me later for the opera which was brilliant!!! ordering the tickets is super easy on line and you get to avoid the line. Also, by ordering the tickets on line you will receive email blast prior to the performance with interesting information and after the performance you get to send in a review. what a nice treat for a busy LA gal!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rosie3118
