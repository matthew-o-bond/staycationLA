Parking 8 dollars weekdays for the day or approx 15/20 dollars on weekends or free alongside the road. Toilets and showers along the beach front , not much in the way of food shops so most people take picnics. Small town centre at one end of the beach, with Starbucks and a up -market supermarket.Have seen plenty of dolphins at Zuma 🐬Particularly nice at off peak times.Really not keen on the tar which is washed up and can sometimes get on the soles of your feet - tricky to remove !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jzeee

We took the long car ride from Santa Monica to Zuma Beach and could not believe how cold it was in early July. It was about 15 degrees cooler than it was back at our hotel in Glendale. We had to put jackets on. A decent beach, but the wind and cold made us miserable. The even much longer ride back to our hotel added to the misery.

There is also plenty of parking.The sand isn't as white and soft as some other beaches in SoCal but it's still nice to walk along the shore with the waves crashing in and cute seagull chicks running around. We visited on a warm Thursday morning whilst driving up Highway 1 to SLO so it was also nice and quiet.Unfortunately we misjudged the tide somewhat and ended up getting a little wet, this isn't a big deal normally but we didn't have any towels to drive ourselves on this day!

30,"Popular, but okay","When asked where to beach in Malibu, many said ""Zuma is our favorite."" While clean (no trash, no needles, thankfully), I was a little surprised by the coarse, brown sand of Zuma Beach, as we spread our blanket among beachgoers and watched in fascination as the Coast Guard practiced ""dropping and retrieving"" in the waters before us. That was cool. This beach does have a lifeguard station and a bathroom/changng clothes facility; however, the food facility was closed (Sept).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/364julief

Its a challenge getting there and parking is sporadic at best. Crossing the 101 after you find a spot is an adventure in itself, do not bring little kids here, the traffic is fast and mere inches away, you have to be super aware and cautious getting from vehicle to sand. The beach and surf are decent with fabulous views... no wonder the stars gravitate to Malibu, its a beautiful spot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WanderTheBest

As others have mentioned, free parking is on the street. Be cautioned that traffic is usually crazy, plus there are many bicyclists, so you may want to play it safe and pay the fee to park in the parking lot. It’ll be worth your safety and less stress. The beach is beautiful and clean. Great for long walks, volleyball, playing in the sand and water. Bathrooms are available, as is limited food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kcross10

50,Worth the parking fee!,"Parking here is $8, and definitely worth the money. As we drove to this beach, we saw several cars parked on the side of the road (without a parking fee) for nearby beaches, but we found this beach was not crowded at all. The sand area is very large and flat, and very clean. There were lifeguards, restrooms, showers, and a small walk up restaurant We saw a few pods of dolphins frolic and swim by. The lifeguard walked around several times, giving people warnings when the waves became very strong. We had to heed the warnings and get out of the water, but my kids transitioned to playing in the sand and running from the waves on dry land at that point. This is one of the better beaches we’ve been to. I definitely recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/disneymamaofthree

I was turned off by the tar balls at the end of our day. At first I didn't realize what it was and wasn't careful about where I stepped. Ended up with a pancake sized tar cake on my foot.

50,First visit to a West Coast becah,"This beach was very clean! We had to pay $15 to park, but it was worth it to be right by a bathroom and food stand.

This worked out great as we didn’t have beach toys and bought 2 things for $5 each and we got a boogie board for $16 (it was pretty big).The water was cold, but there lifeguards on duty and police road through frequently on atvs.The showers are outside of the bathrooms, but they did have a handicap accessible one. The changing area was a large room with benches, and the bathroom stall doors were very low, and you could see into the stall next to you. I’m not sure if this is to combat the homeless and drug population, but it was weird to me. We got there around 11:30-12 on a Saturday and left around 2, when we got there, there was tons of parking, but when we left it was packed and a line of cars waiting to get in!I would go back, but get there early.Take your own food, a cheeseburger basket was $15 and hot dog was $6 or $8.

It is guarded and the waves are good but the undertow and the surf can get intense for kids or those uncomfortable in the ocean. For me, the view was boring and a bit lackluster.

The best part though, is there are flush toilets available with toilet paper and sinks with soap and running water (no paper towels though). The bathrooms are well maintained with the exception of my most recent visit. Towards the end of the day (5pm), the bathroom was a mess, and no not stocked with toilet paper. I attribute it to the fact that there was an overabundance I'd visitors that day due to an extreme heatwave in surrounding areas (temperatures at 115 degrees Fahrenheit).

40,Large beach with soft sand,Beach is large enough to have a lot of visitors without seeming crowded. Very soft and clean sand. Ample parking but be prepared to hand over the $15 to park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancysC8364ZG
40,"Beautiful, pristine, but caution!","This is one of the most beautiful, pristine, accessible, non-rocky public beaches in Malibu and all of California. With 2.5 miles of open sand and waves, this is iconic Malibu at its best. This beach is fantastic for spotting whales, dolphins, pelicans (especially diving for fish), seals, etc during their respective best seasons for viewing. Also, great whites, tiger sharks, and manta rays frequent the waters along Zuma Beach because their prey like this area, too. I caution visitors unfamiliar with this beach. It has numerous, strong rip currents that can pull the unsuspecting and unprepared visitor far out to sea. There’s a reason why the Lifeguard Headquarters are located in the middle of Zuma. It’s a nexus of several rip currents that converge in front of the HQ, making it a very dangerous beach spot in Southern California. Best to enjoy the waves right in front of the nearest lifeguard tower, should you need to be saved, and there are 12 towers to choose from. Good surfers can take advantage of the larger, chunkier waves than other SoCal beaches. All things considered, Zuma is safer for water sports than the adjacent Westward Beach/Point Dume — with its short shelf that causes the waves to crunch down on anyone in the water compared to Zuma with a longer shelf before it drops off to deep water, enabling the waves to roll in for a good ride. After enjoying the waves, rinse off in the free, outdoor, cold showers. The homeless frequent this area and use it for sleeping and bathing. At dusk, they go to their camps near the tunnel entrance. If you’re able to feed the homeless, God bless. Any of the beaches in Malibu are superb for sunsets, particularly in the wintertime when the sparse clouds are lit up in purple, pink, orange, red by the setting sun. Also, while the parking behind the kiosks right next to the beach is $15, there’s limited free parking along the Pacific Coast Highway. The parking signs are numerous and show where to park and not. Parking tickets abound. Avoid parking across the street because every year pedestrians are struck by cars traveling 50 MPH along the coast highway. Be aware that two of your vehicle’s wheels when parked must be on pavement, otherwise, you’re ticketed. Zuma is a state beach, run by the county, and visitors have been ticketed for bringing alcohol as well as bringing their dog(s). In fact, the life guards have been known to drop everything and run(!) to ticket dog owners with their dogs on the sand or in the water during the busy summer months.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bliss90265
20,Busy and noisy,Very busy and noisy on a sat ! Nice beach but not anything special ! Point dume far better beach ! 15 dollars to park here unless you find space on side of road !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markhH8098WY
50,Best Sunset Ever!!!,We took the time to drive up the cost from LA. Well worth the trip. The beach was quite. The Sunset was beautiful.We saw seals swimming with the surfers.Best experience on the trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevenhD4733WL
50,Beautiful,"Zuma is a beautiful beach that is exactly what you picture when you think of southern CA beaches! It costs $15 to park, but you can just as easily park on the street for free. Maybe no “just” as easily as you have to make a small jump down just a couple feet so if you have small children and a ton of stuff it might be worth it to park. They accept credit cards.The beach as I mention is beautiful and very well maintained. There are a ton of life guards which is nice. The waves here can get really big so it’s a great place to surf or boogie board! We saw dolphins today!!!There is a clean bathroom (for a beach bathroom) and even a snack bar (which I’ve never used to can’t speak to it’s quality).Zuma makes for a wonderful day to the beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage
40,Boogie boarding fun,"Parking is $15 and Sheriffs are using the opportunity to check registration stickers to make sure they are valid. So after paying $15 to park , I was ticketed because my registration sticker wasn’t displayed.There are plenty of bathrooms and trash bins, so that makes me a happy beach goer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3Guapastravel
50,Lovely beach,"Long sandy beach, just wanted to say well done to the people of Malibu. I walked quite a way down this beach and I did not see one single piece of rubbish. The water also looked clean and clear.Will definitely come back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Louise673

40,Plenty of activity without crowds,"Heading from Venice beach to Zuma we were (pleasantly) shocked with the lack of crowds. There are volleyball nets, plenty of life guards and a vast amount of sand and yet hardly anybody else was there at the same time as us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LiannaS539
40,Seals and dolphins,"Friends of ours took us here so we could experience a Malibu style beach walk. Parking costs money if you can’t park in the street and the toilets are pretty bad, but the beach itself is fairly good.The highlight though was the walk at the southern end of the beach that takes you up the top of the hill and down to the next beach. While at the top, we looked into the ocean and saw heaps of dolphins and seals close to the shore. Apparently they also get plenty of whales visiting the area. It was fairly busy there but that is normal for a Saturday. We were told it’s much quieter on other days. Great place for tourists to bring their kids as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Didge432
50,stunning,"Loved this place. We went twice during our vacation to Los Angeles. A beautiful beach to go for a long walk. Everything was clean.It was relatively cold and windy for March but that made no difference.During our first visit they were shooting a movie but nobody on set would give any information. Still, cool to see the process.Go to this beach. You will not be disappointed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YOWtravelling
50,A jewel not to be missed,"Having been to Malibu a handful of times over the years, it's a bit of an odd place. The wealth/celebrity factor weigh heavily on the air of the town, but there is also pretty conspicuous evidence of an emerging (or abiding) grunginess. That said, Zuma Beach never fails to seduce and lift away all other elements and considerations if you let it. Go at sunset; you'll be hard-pressed to find a more beautiful scene.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlitterToastNYC
50,Go on a weekday,"We went on a Tuesday in late March and there were only a handful of people, some even in the ice cold water. This is a beautiful beach, with picturesque dunes. Some sunbathers chose the top of dunes for their sun worship. On the day we went, the beach was immaculately clean, as were the freshly washed down restrooms. In future, I will make the drive north of Malibu just to expose friends and relatives to the pristine beauty of a Southern California beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrequentTraveller034
50,"Off season visit, so very quiet and beautiful","After having bad weather for a couple of days, we took the opportunity on our last day (when the sun finally shone) to go to the beach. It was off season, so the beach was empty with only a handful of families, surfers and locals walking/ running.The beach was clean and the so were the restroom facilities (which was shocking to me!).I spotted a celebrity’s wife (my husband thought it weird that I knew who she was, but he has to love me anyway). But the most amazing thing was the amount of wildlife in the ocean. We saw a dolphin cruising around the surfers and in the distance at least 3 pods of whales/ dolphins frolicking around.I can imagine being there in high season may be different but it definitely worth a trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/174katyr
50,BEST DAMN BEACH IN MALIBU****,"Hands down, the most magical, surreal spectacular beach in Malibu. I saw whales and sharks SO close to the beach!! Beautiful rock formations and cliffs. Simply MAGICAL. Don't deprive yourself of one of the most beautiful beaches in the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annep774
40,Awesome almost endless beach,"We spent an afternoon here with our 8 yr old son. After a nice beach lunch we headed out on a walk along the water. We passed maybe 2 people! The water was that gorgeous bright blue, and we spotted seals playing in the waves. I would definitely go back to this spot! It was clean and quiet. Great place to just love life and get away from it all for awhile!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steelewood
50,Relaxing Stop!,"My husband and I stopped here to just relax and enjoy the day! We parked along the street, although there is a huge pay to park lot. We went to a little grocery store just north of the beach and picked up drinks and pistachios. Then we sat on our blanket, snacking and watching dolphins just off the shore. This is a beautiful, clean beach! Great place to spend the day or just to watch the sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claytravisamy

50,Best beach in the US,"We visit California every year and always make time to spend several days at Zuma irrespective of the time of year. Wonderful wife beaches with plenty of space to set up rugs & picnic baskets. I’m by no means a powerful swimmer or surfer, but still enjoy swimming here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeoffWJohnson
50,"Beautiful, relaxing day","Nice beach. Parking $6, but some people parked on the side of the road rather than paying for parking. A few surfers and some others enjoying the beach. It was quiet and relaxing. The bathrooms were open but the snack bar was not - probably since it was December.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andrea01010

50,"Beautiful, Clean and Serene","Went to this beach after the Malibu Wine Safari (10 minute drive) for a birthday photoshoot and it wasn’t crowded. The place as so clean. We found some metered parking right at the entrance. The water was beautiful. Not every LA beach is clean, trust me. I live here. Skip Santa Monica and just go here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jellej92
50,Beautiful beach,"We decided to take a day trip to Malibu and saw reviews on Zuma Beach. It was Friday after Thanksgiving - whether was beautiful. Views were great - sand was well maintained - beach wasn’t too crowded. Waves were great and water was clean. Nice improvement from Santa Monica beach. Worth the trip if you are looking for something to do while in and around Santa Monica. Zuma definitely epitomizes the typical California beach. Would definitely return. Only drawback - pay to park and no food options (although we were there out of season).Overall, very nice visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Markpicc
50,The Best Beach for Waves!,"My friends and I came here on a whim; we loaded up our car and drove from Santa Barbara. We spend the day swimming in the warm water and body surfing and had a blast. I would keep in mind that the police patrol is pretty intense, they'll even scan your cups if they suspect you are drinking alcohol. But a beautiful beach with plenty of parking and lots of fun to be had!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K9563SUjenm
40,"Sand, Sun & Beach","If you're looking for a clean relaxing beach with fewer people and nice surf, it's worth the extra drive from LA. There is a changing house/restroom. There were no lifeguards on duty when we went (a Saturday in late November). There is a pay parking lot but we parked for free along the roadside",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Partera60
40,Huge empty beach,We went a couple times during the week. Even though the weather was great there was no one there. I am told it is more crowded on the weekends. Stayed for the sunset. it was beautiful,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V8303MPtomr
50,Always the Best Beach,"You want to go to Malibu, but what you don't know is you really want to go to Zuma. Miles of wide, gorgeous beach. Lots of lifeguards, lots of parking. Bathrooms, snack shops, showers. Zuma, baby, Zuma. Free Zuma if you're young, fun & single 😉",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizsokctraveler
50,Maybe my favorite beach in So Cal,"Not as crazy as the ""city beaches"" from Santa Monica to Long Beach. You feel like you're ""away"" but still convenient enough to LA. Good facilities. This is the site of the annual Malibu tri, so good swimming as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kenpasadena
30,Pleasant surf beach with celebrity homes built on public land,This is a quite pleasant surf beach in Malibu which we visited during the Starline Celebrity Homes Tour. It isn't of the same quality as Australian or Philippine Beaches but all the same a nice hangout place.What amazes me is that many of these homes belong to celebrity's or the rich and have been built on public land. Many years ago apparently a few palms were greased for this to happen.Worth visiting these beaches as you may spot a celebrity.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tommomelbourne
40,"Big waves, beautiful beach!!","We stopped at Zuma Beach after hiking up Solstice Canyon on a very hot day. This is a lovely beach, but the surf was too crazy for us to swim. However we were able to cool off.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/willkommenhof
40,A Nice Beach,As we were going up the Pacific Coast Highway we found large public parking lots next to the beach which made it easy to reach. The beach was clean and a great place to soak up the sun and check out the surf.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erodrig26
50,Beautiful beach,"Stopped by for an hour or so the other week before we were leaving LA. A beautiful beach, plenty of space and even on a Saturday didn't feel crowded at all.

Would definitely visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/olihenryy

50,My fav beach,This has been my favorite beach since I was a child. The beach is long and wide so plenty of room for the people. The waves are strong here. Be careful because it can get quite rough and sometimes there is a strong undertow. I suggest making sure you sit in front of a manned lifeguard station (some of the stations are closed when it's not as busy).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/purpletabby
50,"Sun, Sand and Surf!","Great beach with a parking lot if the coast highway is full. This beach is about a half mile of space, which, fills up during the summer time! During the morning, the lifeguards allow surfing. When the lifeguards hang the yellow flag with a black ball in the middle, no surfing is allowed because of safety issues. There is no shade so bring an umbrella. The winds usually pick up in the afternoon. There are a couple of food buildings but bring your own food and sodas. Smoking and alcohol are not allowed. Oh, also, leave your doggies at home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whiteshome1
30,Small beach,"We did not stay very long, there is hardly any beach to be on. The waves are huge, and did not look safe to swim in. Bring your own food, as the food booth that is there has a woman working it who does not speak English. Not really impressed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebStr2016
50,Not a pristine beach,"Not a pristine beach. Lots of parking, rest rooms, and volley ball nets. Perhaps the last place I would go to contemplate the waves and watch the sunset. Great for children and young families.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
20,Left after an hour,Wasn't impressed with this beach. $8 parking and a very long walk to the water. Extremely windy the day we went. The water was freezing. Ended up leaving and going to El Matador which was much better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KiraN218

30,Popular surf spot,Zuma Beach which is a drive out past Malibu proper is a nice beach area and is very popular with the surfers due to its orientation to the ocean. Nice spot for a stop,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
40,Day at the Beach,Chose this beach after reading reviews on Trip advisor and wasn't disappointed.Went on a Sunday and even though it was busy had no problem finding a paid parking spot and the beach is large enough that it didn't feel crowded.Our son loved body boarding in the waves and the beach dropped away slowly so had no issues with him getting out of his depth. Was nice to see the dolphins swimming close by. Would recommend if you are looking for a beach in the Malibu area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KiddyBoy
40,"Relaxing beach, not loud",This was a very relaxing beach. There was a good hut there but it didn't offer anything healthy. You are better off bringing you own healthy snacks. Very clean bathrooms and good waves came in. I really enjoyed this beach compared to many others because of the serenity it offered.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debs476
40,Fun day at the Beach,"Went to Zuma Beach this weekend. Water was great though a bit choppy. Plenty of Life Guards and law enforcement constantly checking area, patrolling.

50,Big beautiful beach,"Had a great day at Zuma Beach. Even on a Monday, there were a lot of people but because the beach is so large, it didn't feel too crowded. Played in the surf and watched waves. Only sad thing was we saw the LA County Sheriffs come out to write a ticket to a family that was drinking beer. Was a shame as they weren't bothering anyone and were just enjoying a day on the beach. It's sad that there are rules against simply drinking a beer at the beach instead of rules against drunken rowdiness. Was still an enjoyable day for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jerjon

There are facilities for practically every beachtime activity & sport.I spent a day enjoying Zuma to the max ~ picnic spread, beach umbrella, blankets, the works. Played on the beach & in the surf. It was like being part of a scene on TV or in a movie!

40,Awesome - but don't forget surrounding smaller beaches,"Zuma will always be that great big lovely stretch of beach everyone goes to on holidays, but immediately before it is Westward Beach, which has slightly smaller crowds and the benefit of the Sunset Restaurant with a DJ, and then Little Dume Cove which is the most awesome of them all and you can then get to Paradise cove during a really low tide. I like Zuma on a big 4th of July/Memorial day weekend if you arrive early, but for day to day beaching the others are better. North of Zuma has some nice ones as well, but they always feel a bit too far north - especially if you need to run to the store or grab a burger.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_swg1111

Very low key.So many other fantastic beaches in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y4581KProbertk

There should be more restaurants nearby but it's lovely..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rikkarikka32
50,Great PCH stop,"We were heading up the PCH and stopping wherever and whenever we wanted and saw Zuma State Beach. The parking was free, the skies were blue and plenty of surfers were out so we stopped and spent a couple hours just people watching, especially the surfers. The waters were so clean and mild and the waves were perfect. The sand was clean and perfect for walking. We could’ve stayed there all day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3743BSdaniela
50,Nice Beach crowded on weekends,"We visited Malibu on a road trip across California. We initially passed Zuma beach on a Sunday evening on our way out to eat and it was very crowded. We went to the beach the next day on Monday during the day early around 9 am and it didn't start getting crowded until around 1 pm. We left and passed by later and it was much more crowded later in the day. They have lifeguards, bathrooms, showers and you can either park on the street or in the lot for a fee. Some areas of Zuma beach have alot of surfers because there were large waves. My kids ages, 15, 12 and 5 had a great time at the beach. We went to Carbon Beach a little further down the next day and it was virtually empty. Houses back up to the beach which gives you less space on the beach once the waves come in but it's a beautiful area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G6658SElisat
50,Great Family Day!,"We drove up from Santa Monica to Zuma Beach and arrived on a Saturday around 10a.m. We paid $15 to park and found a spot right away. The water was a little on the cold side, but the kids still loved playing in the water and riding their boogie boards. We got lucky and were on the south side of the beach where it wasn't too crowded. The northern side of the beach looked like it was packed! It started to get more crowded on our end as the day wore on. There were bathrooms, that started out clean... and food you could buy as well with just a 5 minute walk. We packed a cooler and had lunch on the beach. Many people had tents and umbrellas. We had a great day. The beach was clean and the lifeguards saved several people from a nasty riptide.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenniferJ45150
50,Best Walking Beach,"Very wide, beautiful beach and you can walk and walk and walk. We almost always see dolphins and surfers. Lots of free parking on the street, although sometimes the street is full and we pay the $8 to park in the enormous lot. Many restrooms and a couple of food stands make it very convenient. Love it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luv_to_travel_TO
40,Great Visit,"We read the recommendations on this Beach before visiting Malibu and decided to visit.It was a great spot, seems to be a busy spot during the days but there is a lot of space on the beach, toughest part may be the parking filling up if you aren't there early enough, however still not a big deal to wait for someone to leave and get a parking spot.I would definitely recommend checking it out if you're looking for a great Beach spot with many dolphins playing close to shore in the area while we swam.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Matthew_613
50,Great beach to spend a day,"We wanted some beach time. Zuma is perfect for that. The parking is expensive ($15 .. and you still need to search for a place). But the lifeguards are active and on the lookout, the beach is broad and beautiful. We did not swim (too cold), but did enjoy watching the waves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luke2John
50,Beautiful Beach,"We were staying in LA and made the decision to drive to Malibu for the day. It was definitely worth it just because of Zuma beach. It is the most beautiful beach I have ever been too. The weather was so warm, sand so clean and the water was so nice. We paid the $8 for parking but would just park on the street next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/150jacobm
40,It is ok,"Nice to visit a different beach but the water is always too cold (almost no one go in the water without neoprene).the sand is very white and clean and the view is beautiful. Parking lot is 15 dollars on weekends, 8 dollars if you arrive after 9:00am and 3 dollars if you arrive before 9:00 am. Bathrooms are clean and you can shower outside to get the sand off.Not an special or pretty beach if you saw Carribean but a ""must go"" place of you are visiting Malibu",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lisandra11
50,Clean beach,"Located along Pacific Coast HWY. Pass Malibu Pier, pass Pepperdine University, and pass the homes of Robert Downey Jr and Robert Duval (of course i did not get to see the homes personally). Parking available off the HWy for free. Jump over the sidewalk / parking lot and your on the beach. Beach itself is clean, not crowded at all. No surfers. Water super cold.. walked the shore a bit. Very little to no sea shells out there. Waves were rough but the ocean was mesmerizing. Laid out a bit and enjoyed the sound of waves, sea gulls, and Cali rays. Clean restrooms and showers available!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CynCeeG
50,Peaceful and beautiful,"My favorite beach in Malibu, Los Angeles. You can spot dolphins, whales, sea lions, pelicans and other species. I love coming here the warm days during the winter when there are less people on the beach. The surf is great and you can even rockclimb. The long wide sandy beach streches for miles and Zuma is one of the healthiest beaches with clean water in Los Angeles County.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lenar577
50,my favorite beach in malibu,"I live just above this beach, and I love it so much, even on the most busiest days this beach has lots of room. lots of wonderful sand, and places to play volleyball there is a section, us locals call free zuma where you can park right on the sand with no parking fees...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeinMalibu
50,Free Isn't Always Free,"Zuma Beach is wonderful with lifeguards, restrooms,showers and plenty of parking. Parking thru the week is 8 dollars and there is free parking on the street, however..Deputys patrol the street that runs parallel to the beach and the free parking on 4-wheelers. They issue citations to the cars that are in the free parking. Mostly what I have seen is citations for no front license plate, illegally tinted windows, expired registration, you get the idea. They don't issue citations to cars that have paid for parking! Alcohol is not allowed on the beach and occasionally you see a Deputy checking drinks and coolers. On busy weekends get there by 11 a.m. to secure a good spot on the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertD350
50,Still a great spot,"I've returned to Zuma Beach, Point Dume, CA.,just north of Malibu for the first time since March, 1969. You now pay for parking but the beach is sooo nice. Used to come out from LA to watch the moon set over the ""red tides"". Great memories. Guys roll their ice cream carts by selling cold confections and there are what look like actual food concessions in permanent buildings every 1/8th mile along the parking area. Everything you need except SPF 85 sunscreen. Ha, ha. Lots of sun and fun. Even beach volleyball set ups are in place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B2354CGdavidg
50,Lifeguards are Awesome,The beach is fabulous and the lifeguards are top notch. Bathrooms are close and convenient also. We had no problem parking on the street because we were there in the middle of the week.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/891kelle
50,Just Like I Remember,"This was the beach we went to when I was a kid, and it is still breathtakingly beautiful. Great parking for fifteen dollars. Bathrooms are clean. Fast food joint is slow, but worth the wait. The people waiting in line are interesting. The beach is clean, and there are plenty of lifeguards on the weekend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karynb627
50,huge white sand beach,"This might be the longest stretch of white sand beach I have ever been to. It seems to go on forever. We were here early in the morning and people were everywhere. There were tractors raking the sand so the beach was very clean. We didn't stay too long, but with more time this would be the perfect place to spend the day. great waves for surfing, boarding or just swimming in. huge parking lot but it was $15 for the day. There is also plenty of parking on the street if you want to go that route.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rexhans
50,Family vacation,"Best beach by far and we found it by accident. My 17 year old and I went exploring and decided to drive to Malibu. While there we came across it. Isolated, unpopulated and clean. Just the way we like it! This will be a primary destination on my next visit to CA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M686CSbryans

40,Love the sand hate the tar!,"Being from Texas, I have always loved California beaches. It was a fun day at the beach until we were ready to leave and we all had tar on our feet. I am used to this on most Texas beaches but was surprised and a little disappointed to find it in Cali. I guess drilling is affecting all our coastlines. Still beautiful day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Astros80

40,"Weekday in April: Great Waves, No Crowds (and limited access to changing rooms)",We visited recently so that we MA residents could test the Pacific Waters. We were just to the North side of Lifequard Headquarters (which Wikipedia describes as having the strongest rip currents). My husband and son were body surfing and the waves were big and the pull was strong. We had to walk to several bathrooms to find one that was open on a weekday for changing. I assume once school is out there will be more open. Nice sand beach to walk on. My husband and I walked toward the southern end of the beach and saw 2 whales (the season apparently) as well as some dolphins.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/858ClaireW
50,Empty and massive,Stopped on Zuma beach on the way into Malibu and LA. The beach has a massive pay car park but also lots of space for parallel parking on the road for free. The beach had very few other people on it and the waves were big enough for surfers. You're not going to see any Malibu 'celebs' but that doesn't bother me.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5cruffy
50,Beautiful Beach,Great wide open beach on the Pacific Coast Highway. Disappointed because we paid parking and thought we could find a good truck. Not the case should have parked on the highway and walked around and contato a food stop. It was pretty just a little too windy and cold to sit on the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dawnlive2travel
40,Cool beach pit stop,"Right off the Pacific Coast Hwy, a great cove beach for all ages. Good for volleyballers, surfers, and kids with parents.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RelaxRP
50,Vivian,It was very nice and quite. Way less crowded than Santa Monica but it is less garnished like it doesn't have a bike trail or beach benches. I want in April and it was still too cold to swim,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/855viviennew
40,One of the best beaches around,"We spent a full day at Zuma Beach and really enjoyed it. The Southern end of the beach has some great waves for surfing. The sand is wide and soft, which made it terrific for the kids. We saw some whales cruising just off-shore throughout the day. Then there's the view of the mountains over the Malibu coast, making it a really picturesque. The face of the beach is at an angle that seems to avoid a lot of the wind, so it felt really pleasant on a spring day. All-around it was a terrific place.There are lifeguards on this beach, which is always comforting, especially when there's lots of kids around.One complaint, no bathrooms. They were all ""closed for renovation"", which made it difficult on the kids that didn't want to get into the water.There is one gap between the paid parking lots that allows free street parking right on the beach. We were there early enough to snag some spots... 9:30 AM on a Tuesday morning. But the free spaces were probably all taken by 10:30 or 11.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barton24
50,Fabulous!,"Great sandy beach to walk, sunbathe, surf and chili out. You can park near the beach, free if you have blue badge. Very clean, Life guards around too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SamW193
50,Great for everyone,"This beach has easy access restroom, food and is large. Its a great beach for families. Still respect Malibu and our beaches please!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MalibuFamily
50,Whales and more!,"Always so refreshing to spend time walking on Zumba beach. It is the most serene experience seeing dolphins, surfers and even whales in the migrating season. I always find it uplifting there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/59Cathy
50,Beautiful ocean breezes,"I love this beach! It gets crowded on weekends, especially Zuma 7 (lifeguard station). There are beaches from Zuma 1 to Zuma 11 or 12. Some have bathrooms, but only Zuma 7 has food. You can bring your own food, but no alcohol. I started coming here from the San Fernando Valley when my daughter was around 8 years old. She is now in her 30'sand I still love it! It is clean and well guarded. The lifeguards are the best!! We leave the San Fernando Valley and take highway 101 to Kanan Dune Road and have a beautiful drive through the mountains to Highway 1 (PCH).What else can I say? It's the beach;beautiful ocean, nice and breezy even on the hottest days,and maybe you will see a Dolphin or a Whale!Enjoy!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S7591ZXdianeh
30,Pretty good beach,"This beach wasn't to far from the valley and got lucky we didn't hit too much traffic. Another great thing is that parking is free up on the street. The beach wasn't that pretty to me but there was a good variety of people some sunbathing, some surfing and some just playing in the ocean. The water was cold so we didn't stay here too long not much to do. It is a nice place to go if you are in the area and want to go to a beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Merchman
30,Pretty beach,My son and I visited Zuma beach on Saturday March 18th. We drove from our hotel in Long Beach. The traffic was unbelievably busy. Just a nightmare. The parking lots to the beach were closed so we had to park on the street with the cars whizzing past us. The beach itself is very nice and user friendly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucydelferraro
50,Good beach for everyone,We visited the beach with our toddler daughter. The beach is not crowded and so one can relax peacefully and have fun at same time. Our daughter has a wonderful time as she kept running and playing with sand without disturbing anyone. The sunset is really beautiful. We enjoyed a lot on beach. A great beach to visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mansi_Vij
50,Wide open spaces,"Terrific beach tons of parking, lifeguards in the summer. I usually head left and then take a long walk the length of the beach. Summer, winter, year round but beaware the life guards are there on holidays and in the summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PIT860

40,Was THE hidden gem of the south coast,"Before the rich and famous took over the coast, there was a very ""under the radar beach"" just north of Pt. Dume. It is still very pretty, and only a short ride north of Malibu (for those of you doing the run up PCH... try it on a motorcycle on your way to Ventura) ...it's close enough to LA, has a nice a little wave... it's where my son participated in surfing competitions when he was in 7th grade. He didn't do that well, he was never really into competitions... And some very cool volleyball courts.Bring the family bring a boogie board and chill. there are bathrooms and a place to get food. Wear sunscreen!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardsJ6146QU
40,The Coolest Beach in Malibu,"If you like long, wide beaches with pristine sand then you will love Zuma. Zuma has everything a great beach has except really warm water. It is a great place for families, for surfing, bodysurfing, boogie boarding, open water swimming, running, walking, building sand castles, reading, or taking a snooze in the sun. It is the headquarters for LA County's Northern Section Lifeguards, who are some of the best athletes and most qualified life saving professionals in the world.So whether you want lots of action, family time, r & r, or simply a nap in the sun - Zuma is the place to be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevinsF237EC
40,Beautiful beach,"Zuma is a gorgeous beach. It's long, wide and watched by lifeguards. As of mid-February 2017, the pay parking lot run by the State is closed due to conditions created by the rains, but I would expect the lot to be open soon. On a Sunday of a holiday weekend we didn't have a problem finding a parking space along the access road, but we did see some drivers searching for parking. The parking problem for some was created, of course, by the pay-for-parking lot being closed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brettmI2598CL
40,Great beach but it usually gets windy,This is a great beach. I've been going to Zumba since I was a small child and it hasn't changed much. Bathrooms are standard for all beaches up and down the California coast - stinky and cold but at least they are there and you don't have to crouch and bury or try to find a restaurant to invade.This beach is great for kite flying and other sports where windy is not a factor but volleyball or football is a no go because it gets really windy on this beach! Always windy it seems.Parking is plentiful for a paid amount and it's easy walking distance from the water. Easy breezy and pretty clean in the way of trash and wash up.I recommend this beach to anyone who loves to body surf also. Fairly good waves.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cathyj836
40,The Best Beach Rocks in the United States,"The beach is rough around the edges...dwellings worth a fortune right up to the surf line, trash here and there, and tipped over port-a-johns that have left blue and brown stains in the sand. But the receding tide leaves little pools filled with anemones, and some of the best beach combing stones to be found at any location in the world. If you love scavenging for such treasures, this is a must see stop for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/381LarryM

50,Great Beach for whale and dolphin sightings!,"This morning I popped over to Zumba Beach to kill time before the Malibu Seafood Shack opened. I pulled into the entrance and immediately to the left is metered parking ($1 for 45 minutes I think, accepts credit cards or coins) rather than pay $6 for the lot. The beach was pretty empty at 10 am but there were a few visitors roaming around as well. The beach is huge and the bathroom facilities are only open on weekends. Anyway I walked down the shoreline for a bit just taking in the views and the empty beach. As I was about to leave 45 min later, I took one last look at the ocean and saw a whale's head pop up!!!! Then dolphins!!!! It was incredible. The animals swam near the shoreline for a bit. They were pretty close, not too far out that it's hard to see them. Didn't expect to experience this though online it does say you can spot them here Dec and Jan! I came on Jan 3. Highly recommend to see though it's a big and beautiful sandy beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/girlwhotraveled

50,I will keep coming back for years to come,When my wife and I were first dating we came here on a trip and it was here on this beach I realized how much I loved her. Now many years later the beach still looks amazing as ever. Parking is easy to find and whether you're looking to catch some waves or find some playful seals here and there here's the place to be. The beach is clean and has a great vibe. I will be coming back on every trip for years to come!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidC20456

50,One of the best,"It's hard to beat Zuma Beach. The sands are gorgeous, the beach is clean. This is a pretty popular beach, but the liveliness makes it fun. If you walk far enough out from the main areas, you can find some quieter spots. Great for watching dolphins - this last time we saw a few seals. Must make the drive here if you're in SoCal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/478amandas

40,"Large clean beach, easy parking","We went to Zuma beach after we failed to find parking for Point Dume. There is only one restaurant that is walkable from the beach, so we stopped at a local market and bought sandwiches from the deli before heading to the beach.There is a ton of parking available along both sides of the road adjacent to the beach. At least in November it was easy to park. The beach is quite deep and has very clean sand with plenty of trash and recycling cans for people to use. I didn't look for restrooms, so I'm not sure about that point.This seems to be a very family friendly beach and you can walk down the coast to Dume.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U4404CXchrist
50,Wow!!,Spent 4 days in the LA area. I could happily have spent 1 day exploring the city and the other 3 relaxing on this beach. The beach is a wide swath perfect for long walks in shallow water. I enjoyed watching the shore birds run in and out of the waves. Wish I'd brought a boogie board for the teen to body surf on the waves.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/callesol105

50,Worth a visit and a good walk - enjoy 'the photo...',"Enjoyed our visit - have to persevere with parking - but glad that we did. Really nice place to walk (and assume to live!). Beautiful views. Walked a very long way and finished off with a swim.Be careful with adventurous photography. Stupidly - with hindsight, and probably even at the time - I took my iPhone out into the ocean to get a shot along the beachfront houses. I thought I was acting with 'due care' in this mission, but in getting the photo, I turned my back on the sea (there hadn't been any 'big' waves, as I'd studied their form over several minutes, as part of my thorough research). Needless to say, I got wiped out, went underwater, lost my sunglasses, but saved my phone - in a scene like something out of a film, with just my hand and arm sticking up out of the water clasping my device.Just a tale of caution to prevent similar. Enjoy the photo. Have a good one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harrison-F-Carter
40,Great for long walks.,"Zuma beach is a great place for long walks during the school year (not as crowded), land paddling (I'm the only one I've seen so far), and bike riding too. Its flat, a there and back will clock 3 miles, and if you want to stretch it out you can continue on a flat course to Westward Beach where many films and commercials have been shot (think statue of liberty-Planet of the Apes original).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reyc632

30,One of the nicer and less crowded beaches,"This beach was not crowded probably as it was some distance from Malibu Pier compared to the other beaches. The surf was still strong, and there were manned lifeguard towers a few hundred metres apart. The sand was clean too.The paid car park was vast, and had more than enough lots even on Sunday. Several cars were also parked by the PCH roadside for free too.There is a largish central toilet area, with drinking fountains outside.

F that. We left and noticed all the cars on the side of the road, so we found a place to turn around and got free parking instead!It was early on Saturday morning so not many people were out, the road was quiet, few surfers in the water. The sun hadn't quite come out yet do we didn't swim, just put our feet in and walked along.From what we saw it was a very clean beach with plenty of restrooms and lifeguard towers.

Next time we'll pack a lunch and stay all day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/82trishak
40,Beautiful but I have seen better.,"Staying in L.A. Malibu is a must-go place. Very popular, very crowded, but I wouldn't change Nielsen Park or Parsley Bay in Sydney for Malibu beach. Frying on the hot sand, or panting under an umbrella instead of to lie on the grassy shore in full sun, or just some rays are shining through the foliage of the trees? My choice is the second one. Even not to mention the surrounding rock formations. You can call me patriotic, but to prove the opposite, I wouldn't like better being bitten by an Australian shark than an American one. All that I wrote is only to demonstrate that different people have different tastes in beaches. Malibu is one of the best in most people's eyes, and the perfect waves for surfing are just the icing on the cake.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stinkwink

50,California Dreamin',"We had only one day to spend on the beach during our trip in US. We decided to go to Zuma Beach. I cannot compare it with other beach but i presume that nothing can be better. It is simply amazing. The beach was almost empty, we could use one of the tower used by the guards as base for us and it was like jumping back in an episode of Baywatch. The kids had so much fun.Nothing to say a part...this is the California we always dream about",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paolovbossi
50,My favorite beach in Greater LA,"I have been going to Zuma whenever I am in LA, and this goes back to the 80's! Zuma had much less tourists than most other beaches in Greater LA, it is rather a beach frequented by Angelinos. Very clean, not too crowded and a central snackbar. The water is much clearer than further south while a bit cooler than further south. Great waves and the occasional school if dolphins add to a marv day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dirk747
50,Lifeguards are on Duty,"The beach is clean. Great waves for body surfing. My partner was caught in a riptide but swam with the current and was safe. He didn't know the signal for ""I am safe"" -and just went out again. They called him in and explained their concern and showed him a hand signal to communicate. Great Job in guarding lives!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StellaSt_Louis
30,"Very Windy, Nice Drive Up, but nothing too special","I've heard great things about Zuma beach, and although the scenery is breathtaking coming up Pacific Coast Highway from downtown LA, I must admit that it looks like most other beaches on the coast. If anything, Santa Monica is much nicer, but it's definitely a place to go visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonathanmC970CD
30,Avg waves too many too many tourists,Great surfing spot for locals but visitors should limit their visit. Clean beach no parking fees. Great waves.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/766dc

30,If you are a tourist please go here,"We are amazed how many people run here because of its Baywatch fame. We never do - check out Point Dume beach, you'll love it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GuidoKarp
50,A good day at the beach,"Went up and down highway 1 quite a way, this was one of the best beaches, very long, good sand, plenty of parking (even spaces left by the roadside), not too busy. Saw Dolphins in the water, very clean but a bit cold, even in July !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisrheccles

I have been there during our route to SF through the Pacific Coast Hwy..the California 1..I think that this is a place that you can't miss if you are in California..I am sure you will love it..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FabriGra
50,Great beach!,Looking forward to returning to this beautiful beach with lots of (expensive) parking. We visited on a Saturday: lots of people but not too many to detract from the experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/db7477
20,Overrated,Not sure what is so great about this beach. The water was cold and there were lots of rocks. on top of that they want to charge you $8 to park while you can park for free on the road. Definitely overrated. Beach at Santa Monica was much better although still freezing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jfidalg0
50,Great beach,"Love this beach. Really sandy and extra wide in places, loads of parking. Park along PCH if you get there early enough to avoid paying the fee as it is expensive especially on weekends. Not much here in terms of food and drink except one cafe which i don'r rate so bring you own food and drink supplies. Restrooms are a bit stinky but better than none. Lovely long beach with loads of lifeguard stations. Can get super busy especially at weekends so get there early to get a good spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zobo80
40,Nice beach,"Free parking, clean changing area, large beach - Did not see anyplace to rent or buy boogie boards or paddle boards, but there were volley ball nets",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/indysparkle

50,Great beach!,"Easy to get parked for free & although it's a busy beach, it's so huge that everyone has plenty of room. Sand is lush and the waves were great fun! There are restaurants along the beach if you fancy a snack and then get back to the waves. There are showers and toilet facilities all along he beach too. Definitely had fun here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SballNewry
20,Not worth the drive,"In my opinion, Zuma Beach is just a plain, rocky (in some areas) and boring beach. There's no place to get decent food, we drove the whole parking lot (the only good thing about it - there's plenty parking - but it ain't free - $9 flat rate) we found this place that was so greasy and stinky AND expensive! (a small bag of chips $5!!).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GabrielaCh
40,"Great Beach, But No Services","If you are looking for a great beach to play in sand and water, this is it. But, if you need a place to walk around and buy stuff at, then you will be disappointed. Also, get there before 10 or you will be waiting in a line of cars to park. Great for kids, just bring snacks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/844jasonw
40,Amazing huge fun beach,"Zuma is a huge sandy beach with plenty of parking and open spaces to play volleyball and other sand sports, or just lay out, or take a long walk along the waves, or swim or boogie board. Though it attracts alot of visitors, you can always find a spot that's big enough to spread out and enjoy yourself. If you see kite surfers, they are very impressive! There's a bunch of stacked rocks on the north end of the beach. Not sure if it's one person or just random people, but I had alot of fun trying to stack rocks myself. The water was pretty warm and clean to swim in, compared to other beaches around Los Angeles. The smaller beaches in Malibu aren't worth the effort. Zuma never disappoints.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/183annemariep
30,I'd rather go somewhere a bit less crowded,"It's classic, it's got great surf but still: I'd rather spend my day on the beach somewhere a bit less crowded. But that's just me - an introvert.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/henna_mikkila

We also saw dolphins from the beach and they were so close to the beach, amazing show!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeriliisS
50,Quintessential beach experience,"Beautiful, big, clean and lots of safe parking. Great for jogging and sun bathing with food at Spruzzo's across the street. No dogs allowed on any of the state beaches which is unfortunate but don't leave your furry one in the car please. One of my favorite beaches to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/422sh
50,Beautiful Beach,"If you're not sure which bit of the 26 miles m of Malibu to head for, Zuma beach is a great option. Miles and miles of clean white powder sand backed by a paved path. Plentiful rest areas and easy parking at only $8. Not too crowded and a quiet relaxed beach amongst the many options.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Well_travelled_Dad
20,Great location,"Perfect real estate sprawling along the Malibu coastline offers all those willing to pay parking of around $10 per day to park their car and find the perfect square of sand to call their own. Bathrooms are kinda bad, the snack bar is run by people who shouldn't be in the food prep and service business but all that aside, you have beachfront real estate to dream on for your days stay. Being your own food as hinted at earlier.Hope zuma beach managers will make improvements one day though to bathrooms, they can't get much worse.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellewo
50,1st Day @ The Beach with the Babies,It was awesome a lot of fun beautiful weather cool people nice atmosphere no small guacamole or young kids making too much noise it was actually a lot of fun I will kept beach is highly recommended to everyone regardless of the age.

30,Big Broad Beach with world's hottest sand,Great big nice beach; perfect place to stop for surf and sand but really really hot sand. Burned the living daylights out of my right foot. Really bad; had to see a doctor. So stop and have fun but if the sand feels hot. It is. Wear flip flops!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/670marcg
50,Incredible Views,"While in California on vacation, we made our way to the north and south looking for all of the touristy things to do. Malibu was on that list. We buzzed through the town, and then stopped by a few of the beaches for some pictures of the ocean. It was a nice drive with plenty of salty air for those not from the coast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/runaway2travel
50,PCH,Beautiful beach. Climb the trail to the top for interesting views. Great stop while driving the PCH on our Christmas visit to the kids in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeddyParker

50,Longest Beach in Malibu,"We frequently walk along this beautiful public beach. You can walk on sand or paved sidewalk. There is limited free parking along the highway, but lots of convenient paid parking directly adjacent to the beach. There are many life guards and it is worth checking with them before entering surf. No alcohol or dogs allowed so be advised.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimboMalibu_CA
40,I like the beach as it has also nearby parking,"Nice beach for a day trip with the family. Has good nearby parking, which makes it a bit easier to get there. It is big and wide and provides enough space not to be crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigA1999
50,Great Beach - one of the best in Malibu,"The beach was really phenomenal with white sands and good waves. Lots of parking (both paid as well as on the road) and many volleyball nets around the place.The beach slopes very sharply and then eases out - so be careful which spot you pick. Also certain spots have pebbles after the initial slope is done and this might be an irritation.The beach stretch is long and it has volleyball nets at the start of the beach and also in the middle (about 10-12 nets at each site), so you don't generally have to worry about getting one.Great for young and old children alike. It also has lifeguard stations after every 40-50 feet and they are constantly on the lookout.Saw a few dolphins swim very close to the shore.Overall a great experience and one of the best beaches in Malibu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vriyers
50,"We agree, best beach in Malibu","We drove up the Pacific Coast Highway and found Zuma Beach to be the best beach in the Malibu area. Parking is convenient, sandy beach is great and waves are good but not too big.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/368delc

40,Relief on a hot day,Beautiful beach. Parking. Restrooms far between. Attentive and considerate life guards. Keep eye on kids. Big waves and undertow.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shaynacharter
40,Wonderful beach experience,"We went on a cloudy day. It was warm, but comfortable, a lot of people were swimming. The ocean was nice and inviting. The beach was clean and not crowded due to the clouds. The parking lots along the beach are easy to access and not overly expensive although a lot of people park along the road for free. The sand was very soft and didn't get too hot to walk on like it can get on a hot crowded sunny day. We had plenty of space to ourselves and walked easily up and down the length of the beach. The mountains at Zuma Beach are not overly developed with houses and the views are spectacular. On a good day you can see dolphins frolicking within 50 yards of the shore. I still got a sunburn.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/859alanr
40,Beautiful Beach,This is a beautiful beach. The sand and water are beautiful. There is a trail to side of the beach where you can climb to the top of the cliff and get some great pictures. Great location.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lifesabtthejourney

The surf is quite nice for a body board, breaks a little close to surf.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/napakettu7

50,Best Beach in Northern LA County,"I have been going to Zuma beach since I was a little boy. It is a long and wide strip of sandy beach extending a mile or two. Great place to play volleyball, surf, body surf and people watch. Often you will see dolphins playing in and just outside the surf. You can also spot whales right off the breakers. They use the sandbar down towards the southern part of the beach around Free Zuma to scrape off barnacles from their sides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barryk255
40,Probably the best beach in Malibu,"The first time I went to Zuma was in 1961, and I've been back lots of times. Last summer we took our grandkids to take surfing lessons at Malibu Makos, which was excellent. The beach is about 2 miles long, with lots of volleyball nets and snack bars (better food is available at Trancas). Good waves, lots of pretty girls.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DickTroop
50,Family friendly beach!,"We visited Zuma Beach during Memorial Day weekend. Due to the weather it wasn't that crowded, but I'm sure glad we chose this instead of one of the other public beaches. It was well worth the nominal entrance fee. There is literally 2 miles of beach on which to choose your spot, each with its own parking area. It was super convenient! There were plenty of bathrooms, and safety personnel (police, fire, EMS and lifeguards) were out in full force. I felt totally safe and relaxed. We brought a picnic, but there is a small amount of food available at the beach. There is no re-entry to the venue unless you want to pay another entrance fee, so be sure to come prepared with everything you need for the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennyhH6561SY
40,A great beach,"This is a great beach for walking and surfing for older kids and adults. It is sandy and gorgeous, however the seagulls are tough here and the rip tide is daunting for small kids. It is easily accessible for handicap and large families as there is parking right on the beach. There are food stands, bathrooms and a couple of restaurants within walking distance. I love coming here for walks and this is where I film my vlog a lot of the time! From January - April, you will almost always see whales swimming by!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MalibuMamaLoves
50,Great beach for a long walk,"This is a very large and long public beach in Malibu.

There's also free parking along the side of the road that leads up to the Sunset restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1travelguru

20,Beach... Ok,"Well, I'm from Cancun area in Mexico, and I've never seen better beaches than my hometown's so based on that, I didn't enjoy my visit that much. Sand was kind of rough and its color made it look dirty to my eyes, water looked nice but was insanely cold and the waves were too strong. It was more a lay down on a towel on the sand day rather than the kind of beach days I'm used to in Cancun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daniel_Josue

I was hoping the concrete walkway would have been longer, but I was still able to get 3-4 miles in. The beach area was beautiful and the weather was great.

The beach has changed a lot since then. I now live in New York, and recently visited after a long absence. Zuma has more modern facilities, and the park services has improved immensely. Has a great Surf and always an awesome sunset. The nice part it is big and father north than the other Malibu beaches. I like hitting the beach either in the morning or evening when the crowds are not around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WaltG_12
50,"Stunning, relaxing, perfect!",This beach is beautiful. Its nice and quiet. If you're lucky like we have been - you get to see dolphins from the shore - they come in quite close. Highly recommended from the more commercial beaches.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulieC76
30,"Good beach: clean, good sunsets, sand good for walking","There is nothing extraordinary about Zuma Beach, but nothing detrimental either. The sand and surf are clean and fun to walk barefoot in, there is a paved walkway above the tide line, and in summer there are food stands (but I was there in winter, so everything was closed down). In November Zuma was uncrowded, windy, and cool. The seagulls at Zuma have people figured out. They raided our post Thanksgiving picnic and were so annoying that we had to flee their aggression. One gull swooped down on me from behind and stole the turkey right out of my sandwich!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MerrillC_12
40,Great beach for a stroll,I came on a weekday and was shocked how few people were around. Had a beautiful walk along the waves. Would definitely go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuckyLife55
50,Quiet retreat from the busy westside beaches,"As a local, this is my go to beach to get away from the people who frequent the more popular west side beaches. Zuma beach is a bit isolated but great for relaxation on the sand while still getting your tan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Donaldinc
40,Very pretty,There´s no way to go wrong with malibu´s beaches but this one I like it in particular because is more quiet and open than the other ones.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rosaide70
50,My favorite southern California beach,"Been going to Zuma since I was a boy. Not as crowded as other beaches in this part of California, and the water is usually very clear. Also can see the whales pass by here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1jjarecki
50,Beautiful Beach,"This beach is beautiful. Expansive with soft sand. Water was on the cold side, about 65 degrees. It was $8 to park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TinaTheRedhead
40,Malibu Sunset,"There are many beaches along the Malibu coast, some of them are crowed and some are isolated. Zuma beach can get very crowed during the summer, but you can catch amazing sunsets here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/levt_art
50,Go for the sunset,"Zuma Beach is a great place to spend the day, but it is an AMAZING place to watch the sunset. Its a very popular beach, so it can be crowded in the on season, but take the day, drive the coast and then come out as the sun goes down - it doesn't disappoint!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StacyM171
50,Sunsets at Zuma,Watched the sun set at zuma beach. It was lovely. Sand was soft and seems the waves where good as people still surfed in the early evening.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luluxlou
50,The Perfect Non crowded Beach,Went to the beach for the day to relax and enjoy nature with my son. This beach looks as if it is vacuumed every night. It was so nice and clean. The waves were great. One word of advice. Don't feed the birds. The ladies down the beach did and had friends all day. It did make for great entertainment!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dfb311
50,Beautiful Beach off the PCH-1,"We moved to LA back in the summer and meant to get up here sooner. We had only made quick stops in the past when we visited from NorCal.We took a trip to Zuma Beach in early November, it's about 30 miles from Santa Monica. The traffic on the PCH-1 from Santa Monica wasn't TOO bad, but I would recommend getting an early start for Malibu if you are coming from the south.We opted to park right off the highway, so it was free. Bonus!In the past, the food stands have been open, but now that it is off season they are closed. Luckily, the bathrooms were open!My husband and I aren't really sit on the beach people, we prefer long walks on the beach. This is a GREAT beach for that. We had a really nice 4 mile stroll and dipped our toes in the water as we went. You could walk a LOT more than that though, the beach goes a long distance.The beach was quite empty in early November, there was only a smattering of people enjoying this gorgeous beach and the lovely SoCal weather.If you are coming to hang out at the beach in the off season, I would recommend bringing some food along since the concession stand is closed.I would say that this beach reminds me a lot of Pismo Beach, which is about 150 miles north.FYI, no pets are allowed on this beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NYCaliKara
50,Quintessential California Beach,"If you're ever in or near Malibu, a visit to Zuma Beach is a must. Wide, sandy expanses with pristine views that will make you glad you came. We were lucky enough to see several sea lions romping in the surf, too. A great beach with a bonus!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianeallard
50,Wow! This was a highlight,"During the month of September, when we visited this beach, we felt like we had it to ourselves. Given, it was a weekday!Amazing views, great place to swim and the drive from Santa Monica was spectacular. We took the canyon drive on the way home and it was just as spectacular. All the way to Pasadena.I would highly recommend spending time here in the mid afternoon and just chill out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cruwys-wanderlust
50,Great Beach,Beautiful beach---so worth it. I could sit here all day and listen to the waves and watch the ocean rolling. We paid for parking--one tip--park on the street/road and walk in-save yourself the parking fee.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnieTigers
50,beautiful beach - not to be missed,"great spot to swimMalibu Seafoood right near heregreat sandy beach -park roadside if you need toVery popular , but a wonderful place to swim - not a surfing beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tzvishevach
50,great beach,amazing views of the mountains and the beach is great. Not a lot of services in October but that was ok as we brought food and had a picnic. The lifeguards are super helpful and watching the surfing was so fun - Malibu's finest!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimDS74
40,Wonderful soft sand and very clean...,"This is a large, long beach with very good soft sand quality. Reminds me of some San Diego beaches I've been to. Parking is only $6 for the day - much more reasonable than Huntington Beach which was $15! Some of the bathrooms are closed during the week, so you might want to check which ones are open before you settle in on the beach. Very clean beach. Nice surrounding views of Malibu. Recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dojodan
50,Peaceful and serene,This was our first visit to California. We visited Zuma Beach during the week and then came back. Each time we went it was absolutely beautiful and serene. We stayed there for about 2 hours and just closed our eyes and listened to the waves.We will definitely come back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnbH4091KN
30,Nice but...,"Why does Malibú have this publicity? The beaches at Malibú are nice, wide, fine sand. That is OK, but I do not feel as these beaches are special at all. Well, Zuma at least was easily accessible and soft, but I do not get it...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jac-and-Jek
50,Don't miss Zuma Beach,"Whether you want to take a walk along the pathway with your dog or lay out on the beach, this is a very wide, welcoming beach. It is a beach break that can be pretty big and sometimes rip tides but on a calm day the swimming is fine. Whales spout along the seashore during the winter months and during the summer there is ample parking in the County lot or along the highway. Public restrooms are pretty good and there are concession stands in the sumer that sell drinks and snack shack fare. A great beach for large parties.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeatherLA55
30,Beautiful beach and surrendings,"After paying for parking which was fine we had a beautiful afternoon walking in the water on the beach and enjoying ourselves, it was very peaceful and calm not too crowded we even enjoyed watching a wedding on the beach.The problem was when we went to use the public washrooms, they were filthy I have never seen anything like it. It looked like nothing had been done all day. What a shame, I know it's a public place, but after paying for parking I feel that this should never be acceptable .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/louise_girouard
40,Cali beach with natural side,"Overall must see in Malibu. What's amazing, as a PNW native, is how long it takes for people to hit the warm beach here: in much colder Oregon it can be packed by noon, whereas here there is nobody out at that time! Solid waves and beautiful beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cinebriate
50,One of the best beaches in Southern California,"Miles of wide, sandy beach; on-site restrooms; lots of life-guard stations; mediocre/overpriced beach restaurants open in the summer; plenty of parking (just be sure to use the lots and avoid street parking, unless you want to risk your car getting broken into).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Newsdoc
50,The best,I have been going here for over twenty five years. It is one of the best beaches to visit of you are a body boarder. You just need to hit up tower 4 or 5. On a big day the barrels are huge!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suisideinc

50,Lovely beach - family friendly,"This is a great beach to visit when bringing the whole crew. The parking lot is long and narrow which means you can usually set up your beach camp without having to tote your things too far. Also, there are a lot of lifeguards in the summer, a concession stand, and accessible bathrooms.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AimeeRM
50,First Taste of CA Beaching,"First trip to CA and first beach to visit. Pacific Coast did not let us down. Convenient facilities, food, and lifeguard services. Pacific was a little chilly at time, but not enough to frown on going in. Very clean and great day at the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnthonyE376
40,Beautiful beach,"It has a long sand area, the water is super clean and cold!, it probably has nice waves to because of the open sea and wind. You can see those ""famous"" malibu houses right on the beach, and moreover, it has an easy acess and it's public. But not crowded!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EstelaAltoe

40,Zuma beach,"Of course beaches in California are different to those in Florida, but I liked this one. Not very easy to get there by public transportation, but it is quite nice. By the way, you can take the famous Mullholland drive to get there from LA and watch Zuma canyons and Malibu park.There is a zone for bathing and for surfing with good waves wich will suit for beginners as well as for experienced surfers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SergeySemendyaev
50,A day at Zuma Beach,Zuma Beach was a short walk from the Malibu Inn. It was not very crowded that day and the beach was clean. Nice place for a family beach outing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FreddyMcReady
50,Gorgeous quiet beach,We visited this beach last saturday and found it to be suprisingly quiet compared to beaches in the UK!Beautiful sand and crashing waves very relaxing to watch. If you prefer a quieter beach than Santa Monica I would recommend this place and suggest to bring some food with you as there is not much around other than 1 or 2 restaurant that get fully booked quickly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicas762
40,Wonderful fine grain sand for building sand sculptures,"Labor Day 2015 was packed at Zuma Beach. Parking in the lot was $14 - a usual day is only $8. The life guards were busy watching the crowds and dealing with rip currents. Small children need to be watched closely here. The waves were 3-4 foot, and the water was 73 degrees! No wetsuit needed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lee-Tarbet
50,Best Beach EVER,"Zuma beach is one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. We hired a car and drove to Malibu - Zuma beach and had the most amazing time. The beach is clean, not crowded and has the most peaceful and zen vibe. Definitely recommend this beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelBunnies69
50,Amazing beach,"I was here multiple times, very nice and clean beach with huge waves. Parking free without charge is little tricky but you are able to find it. I reccommed it as one of the nicest beaches in LA area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pitrf
50,Flat beautiful beach.,This is the largest of the Malibu beaches. One can walk on a nice flat sandy beach for miles. People viewing is fun. You can buy a parking pass or take your chances finding parking on the street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0libbyt
40,Nice stretch of beach in Malibu!,"Nice and clean (seaweed notwithstanding) and good for kids. No real activities/food unless you bring 'em but good beach! If you are looking for more activities/food, head south to Santa Monica. For what it is, it's not bad. Oh btw, if you park it's LA County not State of CA so paid passes don't work here ... park on highway!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffreyW_Wu
40,Day at the Beach,We spent the afternoon with our grandchildren here. It did take a little while to find parking but we did finally find a spot along the road and the walk to the beach was a short one. It was a very busy day on the beach but it's large and we never felt crowded. I do wish they maintained the bathrooms better as there was no TP in any stall and this was just at midday. I suggest you carry some with you when you go.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/techies
40,Beautiful stop in Malibu,"Traveling from the Northern part of Canada, this beach was exactly what we had been waiting for on a nice hot day in May. The water wasn't very warm, so it was refreshing. The beach is very clean and a nice spot to go for a jog too.We parked along side the road so there was no fee for parking and I don't believe there was a fee for entrance either.Lifeguards on duty :)In addition I thought I would add that after coming from this beach I got some black tar on my towel which obviously never came off. Oh well it was worth it !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarlyRaeK
40,"""Lifes a Beach""","Probably one of the nicest beaches we visited on the Coast, very clean, trash cans everywhere so no trash.Clean soft sand, nice waves, good swimming.On a weekday, not too crowded, but on the weekends I'd bet it's packed.Get there early for PCH free parking, or pay the $12 dollars to park.There is food from two places, cash only, food was 'OK""Went there for the beach, not the food.If it wasn't a 4 hour drive back to the Desert, we go regularly.LA traffic is brutal...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RussellA991
50,Epic day at this amazing beach,"Why people don't answer ""ZumA"" when asked "" what is THE BEACH in Los Angeles?"" ....is beyond me. This place is simply awesome. It was 108 degrees out this august day, and it was perfect on the beach. Water was Pacific Ocean cold, but perfect. Sand was hot, but no big deal. Waves were perfect and life guards and staff were on point. What a special place. I would suggest you go further up the coast to lifeguard station 11 at least. Don't be afraid to park on the street...walk is not far.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/22MichaelA22
50,Well worth the visit if you would like to go to the beach in the area,"Great beach for families. Came here with my wife and two young sons after I read the statewide report of local beaches. Many of the local LA beaches received horrible grades from cleanliness (both sand and water) and it grossed me out. Zuma received a A grade. You can find the report here - http://www.healthebay.org/beach-report-cardThe locals may be aware of the beach cleanliness, but as outsiders, I am glad I checked this report out. Almost went to Santa Monica Beach!!As we were out of town, we first stopped by Drill Surf & Skate and rented two boogie boards, bought beach chairs and an umbrella at the market next door. Should have bought the umbrella at Drill, it was a few $$ more, but much better quality, especially in the wind. Now we were set.Parking was plentiful on the Thursday morning we came (around 11am) and we scored a free spot on the shoulder. However, parking is only $8 so it was nice, but wasn't a big deal if I had to pay too.In fact, I left for about an hour to go get some fish tacos for the family and still managed to get a spot on the shoulder when I came back. People are coming and going during the week so shouldn't be very difficult.Waves were not crazy and the kids spent a lot of time in the water. Sand and water was clean and the people on the beach were mostly families and very respectful. There is a nice stretch of soft sand to set your chairs, etc. on.Being from the east coast, I thought the water temp was a bit cold, but this is the norm from what I understand in the area.We had a great time overall and would certainly return to this beach next time we are around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L6495KVmarkg
50,One of The West Coast's Most Iconic Beaches,"This is probably the most photographed beaches in the world. Millions have seen scenes from countless motion pictures and television shows filmed here, albeit almost never identified.At its southern end the rock formations and trails leading up to Point Dume offer some of SoCal's most interesting places.It is isolated in part being reached off PCH beyond Pt. Dume, but only a short drive from Malibu Village.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L5112CDrichards
40,Fabulous beach!,This beach is not so crowded and too much fun in the evenings! Parking is cheap but you can also parallel park on the road (plenty of empty space!),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tshouri
30,Crowded but easy access,"Go early if you want a free parking spot along PCH. Pay parking has lot's of room if free not available. Easy access, just walk directly out to the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/873kristing
50,Great beach,"I recommend Zuma 12 for families with younger kids. It is close to everything and waves were great. Can be crowded on weekends, but only in the afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KCH143
50,fantastic Zuma,Is my favorite beach in California. I spend most of my time here when I am in Usa. I found the beach a little bit dirty this year compared to other years and I wish the resident of this area would make an effort in order to take care of the place and the wild animals who lives here. Last spirng many baby sealions died so it was really horrible to see them dying on the beach with no chance to safe them or doing anything to rescue their life. I will suggest to locals to organize a found raising in Malibu in order to protect the area and all the animals who lives there. Is really an unique place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NinaW75
40,Worth a Visit,"Great beach with at least a fair amount of restrooms and a small ""snack shack"" to grab some grub.Go EARLY, parking is tough and you will be stuck in a long line to enter.Beach is large and quite clean. Very nice choice for a day at the beach in So Cal!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmorgan77
30,Quite nice,"Quite nice but the toilets were not as nice at Santa Monica beach and the food at beach cafe was pretty expensive. You could not pay with credit card either - ATM was available but you had to pay extra fee (3,5$) for withdrawal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annelT3063JE
30,"Awesome waves, dirty beach","Very large area, with many life guards present. Due to changing current this was no luxury. The facilities were dirty and not well maintained. Changing rooms, toilets ( without privacy!) and showers are there, but hygiene is zero. 5$ for French fries is very overpriced, at the snack bar. Many rubbish containers provided, but why do visitors not use them.The waves were awesome; my daughter spend hours with her board in the water!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarinG208
50,Amazingly beautiful beach!!!,"Loved this beach while visiting the LA area!!!!! The beach was clean, and there is a restaurant also to purchase snacks. No need to worry about parking because there is plenty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U4508KZjenniferb
40,"Good location, on main road and lots of parking",Very nice beach. White sand. Lots of people at a Saturday afternoon but the place is huge so not so crowded. Has a shower facility but water is not warm and is very tiny drips. Restroom is not that clean. Overall the place is good. Parking is easy along the road. Parking lot charges fee but easily can find parking along the road. Better than Westward beach which less free parking spaces.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Minami_SD
50,"Beautiful, clean and safe beach with a restaurant",My favorite beach in the LA area! The sand and water are clean and beautiful here. It's usually not crowded. There's a restaurant in case you need a break from the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BJBB32080
40,Clean Clear water and great swimming,"Zuma Beach is crowded for a reason. The waves are just the right height, the water is crystal clear, cool with no coral around and everyone is very nice at the beach. There was plenty of parking that day and the beach is clean, well-maintained and the life guards look out for you. It is a nice place for an afternoon swim but it gets really busy and fills up fast. Very non-pretensious for Malibu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R4960NKjustinw
10,Polluted beach : Tar balls from oil,"the unspoken problem along this coastline is balls of oil tar in the water and sand. Poor facilities, and dirty tar on all our feet After spending an afternoon here with the family. Seems the Tourism lobby is keeping this problem suppressed as we were completely unaware as Europeans. We experienced this horrible problem which affects many beaches from here as far north as Santa Monica. A recent spill in mid 2015 has compounded the long standing problem. So much for our romantic image of SoCal !Not safe for children with strong rip tides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/conorf2014
50,lovely beach just outside of LA,"if you have the time when you are visiting LA drive up to Malibu you wont regret it, just follow the interstate up it was a lovely a drive. Then you are rewarded with these lovely beaches we went on a week day and could park on the road it was deserted, like our own private beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pingu_the_penguin_84
40,"Malibu "" Whats not to Like?""","Weather you are a swimmer , surfer, boogie boarder, or just sitting and relaxing Zuma beach is a great place to spend the day.

50,Totally Worth a Visit,Hang 10 dude. Surfs up. Great spot to grab some rays and chill on the beach. Awesome place for a day of fun in the sun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vincentd972
40,Super LA Beach with the Amenities,"This is the place if you want the Beach Scene plus the amenities. More people than at Dume, but not too many because parking is limited. Good thing. Perfect for families where you need adjacent bathrooms and food. Hang out & enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
50,most favorite beach in LA,I love Zuma beach. Always come here throughout the year with friends or girlfriends. Its more secluded than santa monica beach and i love the vibe and the restaurant that is here. Definitely a must if you're visiting malibu.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonybK1691XA
50,My favorite beach.,"Beautiful view in each direction that you look. My favorite is looking south at the big rock coming out at Point Dume. Easy, affordable, safe parking. Tons of bathrooms.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dawn197606
50,"Beautiful Beach, Great Surf and Beautiful Views","This is a great beach, not far from LA and Santa Monica traveling north on the Pacific Coast Highway. The beach features lots of sand, great surf, and beautiful views of the Santa Monica Mountains. The surf is usually more than adequate for surfing, body boarding, body surfing, and skim boarding. You need to keep an eye on children. There is paid parking in the lots that run alongside the beach and free parking on PCH - just be very mindful of the traffic, which tends to move rather quickly. Surfing usually occurs at lifeguard station 13 or ""Trancas"". There is also an occasional kite boarder or two in that area as well if the wind is up. If you want a more secluded beach take ""Westward"" which is just south of Zuma and you'll find what I feel is one of the prettiest beaches in the world. There's also hiking, rock climbing etc. at Point Dume, which is at the south end of Westward. Best season is July - October. We've been experiencing lots of marine layer in the AM this June.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zumanbabe
40,Lovely--but not a lot of parking,"A nice beach that gets a bit crowded but has food and amenities, and all things considered it's just fine for all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fussytraveler53
50,Pristine ocean by the mountainside,View is breathtaking. Cleanest beach I have ever been to in the U.S. Need to be there early for garage Parking- or you will have to do the meter or park on the sidewalk. Bathrooms with showers available and Food Court in the middle of the beach with fairly good pricing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Goldenbluize
50,Get your volleyballs out,Awesome surfs and a nice clean beach. Lots of police around so be sure to park properly. The waves are nice to surf and have fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DJS227
50,Beach Day Fun,We rented a house in Malibu for the 4th of July week. Beach was great in the mornings ahead of the crowds. Getting there early allows for free and close parking.Beach was very clean and groomed very well. Bring sunscreen as the cloud cover is deceiving.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HammertimeCA
50,"Great beach, off the beaten path","One of the best things about Zuma Beach, is that it's off the main road, which makes it a bit more secluded. My suggestion is to drive to the far south side of the beach, where there is a paid parking lot. Splurge a couple dollars to park here, as the beach is less crowded, and there are public bathrooms/showers available to clean up before driving home. Also, if you don't mind a little hike, venture over the rocks to a REALLY secluded beach where you'll sea loungins seals. I was lucky enough to see dolphins swim by, and even a small family of 3 whales feeding just past the breakers. Simply amazing to watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/555donw
40,Fun place,"This is a nice beach and is very popular so you may have to spend time in line to get in. Once in, the beach also has many people in the summer....is better other times of the year as far as crowds and getting in. The water is often cold..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/448cheriep
30,Vacation,"Very nice beach. The parking was awful. They had 3 attendants working though there were about 8 lanes. Needless to say the delay was irritating especially with a seven year old asking ""are we there yet?"" No rentals of umbrellas or chairs were available. Overall nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsUMB
50,Lovely beach - very popular,"We had to wait in a long line the day we visited. It's a very popular spot in Malibu. The beach is very nice, but the water was cold. We're more used to warm Gulf water, so this was a change. The rock formations are just lovely. After we spent time at the beach we drove up the coast a little and spent time parking and looking down at the water and the sights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelon2468
50,Fun beach,Zuma Beach is very popular as you can see by the number of people that frequent the area. It is a fun atmosphere. Snack bar is located there. Nice restaurants in close vicinity.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rollingst1
40,Popular for a reason,"Zuma is huge, and always gets lots of traffic. Lifeguards are present accordingly, and it's clean. (If you don't consider the restrooms - not always so great. Bring an extra pack of tissues and some hand sanitizer just in case.) And in case you're visiting, don't make the cardinal sin: DON'T FEED THE SEAGULLS. And don't think that putting your food in a bag or under your blanket is going to cut it when you go in the water. You need a cooler or some other sealed (preferably plastic) container if you're going to leave food unattended. Those aggressive birds won't even consider it a challenge. Before you know it, your food will be gone and you'll hear one call out right before a huge flock descends...Seriously...There are volleyball nets, great sand (not rocky), and great surf. Get there early to collect shells! And don't forget to bring a hoodie if you'll be there before 10 or within 2 hours of sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MalibuMomma
50,Neil Young wrote songs in Zuma during his time living on Sea Level Drive in Malibu...,"As a foreigner getting tips from locals, this is the best beach in the LA area. Quiet, big waves and coast guard to keep an eye. Easy parking and clean beach... And an inspiration to Neil Young's album Zuma. Where can you go wrong? :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/874jelled
50,Beautiful beach in paradise!,"Great beach in Malibu! Go hear to avoid lots of crowds and enjoy beautiful scenery in a great area. The scenic drive here is just breathtaking enough.

50,Great relaxing beach,"I don't really love sharing two inches of beach with my closest 10,000 friends, so I love Zuma beach. Although I usually avoid any and all beaches at their busiest times, I always seem to enjoy my day at Zuma. I've been here many times in the past with no kids, and I love it even more now with kids. Lifeguards are always friendly and reasonable, and know exactly where the good spots are for the kids, and which spots to watch out for in the waves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Antrim8
50,Very Pristine,"First time visiting and loved this beach. Went there mainly because of where they filmed a ""Scorpion"" episode. Sand was soft and waves were amazing. Can't wait to return.

40,"Like it, don't love it","First of all, you have to understand Malibu and Zuma Beach or else your expectations may lead you to disappointment. Don't get me wrong, it's a huge beach with plenty of open space and nice parking accommodation along PCH. (parking is available in the lot for a fee). It's the best beach for my taste around Malibu, but it still leaves some things to be desired.My wife and I like to simply park, walk a few feet to the beach, and enjoy peaceful, quiet sunshine. You can park on PCH and you're within feet of the beach. Check.But Zuma is a windsurfer's beach. It's often windy and can be unpleasant if you have small children or want a picnic on the beach.On the other hand, if you come prepared (tent or umbrella) and come on a less windy day, the beach is great.If you have the opportunity and rather enjoy wide open, calm beaches, my pick around LA is Orange County. But Zuma has it's qualities, and is among Malibu's best, most family-friendly beaches.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/399jeremyg

40,Very clean and pretty!,Very peaceful and quiet and clean. I came here on a wednesday morning in march on an overcast cloudy day tho. The drive there was very pretty lots of green mountains. The only reason why i wouldnt give it 5 stars is because i like to have the option to grab lunch by the beach or ice cream. It definately feels like a beach the locals go to as opposed to tourists. If you like the quiet and relaxation this is a great clean beach :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/584edgarb
50,Amazing Beach.,"Zuma Beach is one of the nicest beaches I've ever been too. The sand is so soft and the sea is lovely too, Its also very clean and patrolled by lifeguards along the beach. Some days you can get most of the beach to yourself. Its great to just relax and watch the cool surfers ride the waves.you may even spot a celebrity or two! As Lady GaGa lives around here. Don't pay the crazy parking charges and just park on the street for free just make sure you park sensibly! Make sure to come and take a visit at this amazing Beach. Its around an hour drive from West Hollywood or central LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/orlandouk
50,Beautiful Beach,"I love Zuma Beach. It is a long stretch of light colored soft sand with ample parking if you get there early. There is a boardwalk which you can walk/bike/jog on. The snack bar is adequate. There are things like peanut butter and jelly and hot dogs, which are quick and easy to eat plus other things from the grill. I like to just go and put down and chair and people watch, read a book and walk along the water. I'm not in to surfing or volleyball. If you like to just chill at a nice beach, Zuma Beach in Malibu is your beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debbbiew
30,Zoom Zoom Zumaah,"When the weather is warm, we walk on the concrete sidewalk and the beach. My daughter likes to practice her rock climbing skills and you can walk from the beach up to Point Dume. We usually go in the morning or early evening which is pre or post crowds. The only thing we don't like is that people leave their trash behind and it all accumulates in the small salt water ponds or in the shrubbery. If you do go for a walk, bring a big trash bag and leave the beach better than you found it. I have been doing that for years and it never ceases to amaze me just how much trash is left behind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/247lillys

50,"Beautiful, like something from a dream",I liked the beauty of the beach and the abundant parking. The view of the ocean and horizon is inspiring. It was a great place to walk around and be at peace. The lifeguards were helpful to me when I asked them questions and the help they gave me was very much appreciated. The people working in the parking lot also gave me directions on a few occasions and that was nice. One of them also gave me some useful advice related to the cost of the parking lot at different times and that there were some free parking spots nearby. Nearby this beach is a mini-mall in which I was able to get some food and drinks so I didn't have to drive the car out of the paid parking lot to go to a restaurant. This was quite helpful because the interior food kiosks were closed when I was there. There is also a surf shop nearby where the girl working there gave me directions on how to get to the beach the first time I went there. She had a great attitude and if I wanted to rent a surf board I would definitely go there. I went up to Point Dume and enjoyed the mini-hike and a view of the beach from a different angle. I also spoke to a several people at the beach who I did not know and I had a couple of brief but pleasant conversations with strangers. I also enjoyed watching people play volleyball for a little while. There was also a guy and his 4 or 5 year old kid there. The kid was wandering away from the beach and the father didn't realize it at first. I kept my eye on the kid as the father got up to chase after the kid. I made sure the kid didn't get too far away because I was concerned that it could get hit by a car in the parking lot it was wandering into. The father caught up and brought his kid back into his protection. I was happy to provide the brief supervision I offered. That became an unexpected but positive experience and memory of Zuma Beach. Om.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/623arjunr
50,"Beautiful, relaxing beach","We went on a Sunday morning around 9am and it was almost empty. It was gorgeous and relaxing. We were able to park on the street right in front of the beach - plenty of parking! The waves were beautiful and there were a couple surfers so it was fun to watch them. This definitely beats Malibu Lagoon which IMO was not worth seeing. If you go early enough to Zuma Beach, you will most definitely have street parking so you don't have to pay the $6 entry to the lot. Overall, very nice beach! Beautiful water and soft sand.. would be great for families.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/643annaa
50,Winter wonderland,Visited in mid-January. Pristine beach was barely dotted with people. Tip: Don't pay the $6 entry-fee to park in the lot. Loads of free parking along PCH and the walk is easy.

50,Great place to enjoy the sand and surf,"A great beach, there is plenty of paid parking and even some free parking if you go on an ""off"" day or get there early enough. The water is soothing and exciting, the sand is soft and welcoming. I always bring a chair and when I was a Pepperdine student, my books for studying.

30,All Right,"Drove up from the Santa Monica side. Lots of traffic on the Pacific Coast Highway, as always. They are also doing quite a bit of construction on PCH so the going was slow. Hadn't been to Zuma in a long time. Was shocked you now have to pay to park (of course there was no free parking to be found). I didn't want to pay so only saw the beach from a distance. Seems like a lot of people were having fun. Don't know if it's worth the drive and the parking difficulties and the traffic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WaikikiJ

30,Average,"The day we went it was very overcast - - which I know happens a lot in S. Cal, but it was also pretty chilly and damp. This may be why we weren't as impressed as I expected to be.

30,Nice beach but average for california,Due to its location its visited quite often. There are many better beaches not only in Malibu but also in the LA area. Supposedly this is an area where the beaches start to change from southern CA style to Northern? What ever that means! About a mile south of this beach is a much nicer and better one by the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/622shawnw
40,WOW!,"First time visitor, down for the Malibu Triathlon. They accommodated over 3000 participants and many more spectators with aplomb and organization.

Nice clean sand bottom and good wave ride for body/or boogie board .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vincent414
40,Good Beach,"I'd say this is a pretty nice beach. During weekends it is usually really crowded, so I suggest you go on weekdays. If you are a surfer, the water here is above average.

During the summer, however, the crowds are insane. You can barely find a path to the restroom in-between the umbrellas/chairs/towels. The shore also gets very crowded. That's summer at Zuma.In the non-summer months, the beach is perfect. It is not very crowded at all, still very well maintained, and kept clean. It is a perfect place to just relax and watch the water, or take a walk along the beach. You really cannot go wrong spending time at this beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leslier832

Lifeguards are usually out from May- Labor Day, and have a watchful eye. Wind picks up in the afternoon, so the earlier the better. Great waves for boogie boarding but ocean temps can be cool- a shortie wetsuit helps! Awesome walking along the coast, check the surf report for low tide.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MariK888
40,Sandy beach and good boogie boarding,"We were staying in a house in Malibu that only had a beach at low tide so we drove up to Zuma to swim and boogie board. It had sand for the kids to play in and the brave ones could boogie board. I don't think the waves are normally that strong, but there had been a hurricane in Hawaii and it brought high surf and strong undertow. So it made good rides for the brave. Also on weekdays at least, you can park right on the road above the beach and walk down the slope to the sand. Makes it easy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jan536

Best bet may be off street neighborhood parking if you can find it somewhere. Gorgeous beach though, had some decent waves when I was there 8.2.14 for a wedding ans water was really warm even at night. So there's no fee per say unless paid parking is called for and unfortunately the only pic I have of the beach area is one at the wedding but you can sort of see the beach and available event rental facilities, will also review Malibu West Beach Club",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VanessaR939

50,Fun beach just outside of LA,Zuma beach is a great place to go if you are visiting LA. The waves were great when we went. We were treated by a pod of dolphin who came really close to shore chasing fish and body surfing in the waves. As if that wasn't enough they started jumping up in the air to dive deep for their meal. The lifeguard said he sees dolphin a lot but never that close and never has seen them jump like that! Everyone rushed to the shore to see the show. It was an incredible sight. The water was cold but we went in and did some body surfing ourselves since the waves were so huge!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gobluestl
50,the most fabulous beach,"we had read great reviews about zuma and malibu and had already gone to a few other beaches but when we got to zuma we were so pleased. there was free parking as we got there early enough, changerooms and washrooms and plenty of room to put our stuff and not be on top of other people.the sand was white and pristine, the waves and water were great ( a bit cold but it is the pacific and being Canadian we are used to cold water)i loved the beach and the area itself is gorgeous.went to a small area nearby to eat and shop once finished and the parking was free there as well.All in all a great day at the beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/573suzel

Nothing to write home about.After an hour we moved on the El Matador Beach, which saved our day ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Watching_the_River
50,Surf City and Boogie Boarding,"This beach is awesome if you want to surf or boogie board. The waves a great and constant throughout the day. Also, the beach is extremely long, so while a ton of people go to this beach, if you're willing to walk a bit, you can go where it's not too crowded. There was no undertow when I was there, and lot of families with little kids. The sand was awesome. Warning - there is a bit of tar in the area due to naturally occurring tar coming from oil openings in the ocean. Sometimes this drifts to the beaches which I unfortunately found out about after stepping on some in the water! It's nearly impossible to get off unless you use olive oil or vegetable oil! Watch your step!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/epi007

40,One of the best beaches in So Cal.,"I'm a long time Zuma bodyboarder so thought I'd add a few bits here.Zuma has lots of surfers, bodyboarders and bodysurfers, but this is usually in the mornings, before the winds kick in and ruin the shape of the waves. The onshore winds usually start at about 9-10 AM in the summer. The waves are usually walls with only 5-10% of them having perfect shape. Most rides end in a closeout. When there is a swell running the side currents are very strong. I can find myself having to walk 200 yards back down the beach when I exit the surf, just to get back to where I entered.The waves are strong here, and when they are hollow can really pack a punch. Do not go in the water too far if the surf is big and you are not wearing fins or have a board. Water temperatures are usually 5 degrees cooler than places to the south. the water is usually very clear once you've gone out past the breakers.There is usually free parking before 10 AM alongside the highway, even on most weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Orion_240
50,"Quiet, not crowded","We were visiting the L.A. area and wanted to go to the beach with a friend. She asked if we wanted to go to a tourist-y place or a quiet beach. We said quiet, and she recommended Zuma Beach. We couldn't find a place to park for free, so paid the $8 parking fee to park in the lot. The beach was perfect...a short walk to the water, clean bathrooms. We saw some wildlife...dolphins and seals. A lifeguard told us sometimes you can see whales. It was nice and quiet and my son and daughter loved playing in the waves. A perfect place, in my opinion!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dee29290
40,"Nice Beach, But No Surfers","Good beach for families, lots of kids there. But, no surfers. Bathrooms OK (better than Venice Beach, gag). Good higher end grocery store across the street for sandwiches, snacks and beach supplies if you forgot any. Very windy. Clean beach, free street parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BooKat
40,Surfers' Beach,"My brother lives in Thousand Oaks and this beach was about 35 minutes away on a scenic drive through the mountains to Malibu.My brother said that Zuma is mostly for surfers becuase it's usually windy and the waves are good. The two times I was there it seemed like there were more families and regular casual beach goers.As mentioned there is parking alongside the road, but I didn't want to mess with that so I parked in the large parking lot that charges variable based on the day (7-10 dollars). I liked just being able to drive in and not worry about trying to parallel park or walk far.The sand is nice and there are restroom\changing facilities (a little rough, considering it is Malibu, but certainly nothing out of the ordinary for a public beach) and some typical snack bar type food and snacks for sale.I saw dolphins swiming and really, like others have said, Zuma really does live up to the expectation of a California beach with the gaurd towers, nice sand, surrounding cliffs and houses.Worth a visit if you want to get out of the city and lay in the sun and go for a dip to cool off. The water is generally pretty cold most of the time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cante87
40,Where I used to play......,"I kept my horse at Point Dume and me and my friend rode our horses along Zuma Beach. In the 1960's we used to see people with fires at night, but I think they stopped that a long time ago.

40,Well worth spending a few hours chilling,"Again, with many of the places I've visited whilst being in LA, I was lucky to have a friend with a car. This beach is beautiful. Exactly what you would expect from Malibu (minus the houses on stilts - they're further down the coast). The white sands, the blue sea, the Baywatch towers with lifeguards!! Paring is free along the roadside and unlike some of the beaches we visited in Malibu, this had a cafe and restroom facilities.We were lucky enough to see a pod of dolphins swim past quite close to the shore whig made the trip even more worthwhile.My advice....rent a car and take a drive up Pacific Highway - well worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travel_junkie05
40,"overall nice, safe,except cleanliness in bathrooms","Everything was awesome. I felt extremely safe, sheriff was handy. Except for bathrooms; some were closed and the ones that were open, where disgusting. Toilet paper all over the floor. Not clean and zero privacy in stalls. I would definitely go back. I am hoping they can pay more attention to bathrooms. If not for the bathrooms, I would easily rate it as excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mayeta1
20,Great if you like Malibu CA tar balls,"We stopped at Zuma beach in Malibu to relax in the sun on Memorial day weekend. It is truly a beautiful area with breathtaking scenery. So we found a spot to settle in and take in some sun and even went into the water which quite chilly this time of year. The problem is we didn't notice eary enough there were small TAR BALLS all over the beach mixed into the sand. They weren't immediately apparent until we found the tar on our towels, clothes and our feet. Until they can remedy this problem, I recommend staying away from the Malibu beaches.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bestsurgeon
50,Wonderful Beach-- made me want to move here!,"There are many fine beaches along the Pacific Coastal Highway leaving LA towards Malibu. We liked Zuma because it was clean and there was easy parking ($6 fee) and walk-in access-- I get nervous when I have to park along sides of a busy road!The only issue we had is that the bathrooms were closed--I don't know if this was permanent or temporary. There seemed to be a beach café or something, but we weren't hungry so I didn't investigate too closely to see if they were open.Great beach to walk, surf and swim (although way too cold for May!) Nice walk towards Point Dume. AND we had a real treat with some grey whales frolicking long the coast line, easy to see and hung out for quite some time. That was a real highlight!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bluesmama11
50,can I sleep here?,"zuma has always been a fave of mine, same body of water but just a beautiful beach with beautiful views, sand, little areas to sit and ponder,, love it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoliB818
30,"That's Not a Beach, This..... is a Beach !!","OK , winter isn't the best time to visit or rate a beach I suppose but as I swim all year round I do know a little and I've dipped my toes in the Atlantic, Indian, Pacific Oceans & a couple of Seas !!!I actually liked the whole feel of Zuma. I reckon it's crowded in season, it was pretty busy on a cold Saturday, but no one in the briny ?? Soft , these Californian Girls (& Boys) what ??You can tell parking (paid, free etc) would be a nightmare in busy times but I still think it is a good stop on the PCH and as beaches go I've seen a lot worse !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skeney57
50,Another nice beach in Malibu - who knew?,"Zuma is another lovely beach in Malibu, long golden sand that stretches for a distance. I came here after work and this beach would be really nice with a family, plenty of space and good lifeguard huts dotted generously along the shore front.There's free parking on the Pacific Coast Highway (if you ever want free parking for the beach in Malibu, just use the PCH!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jstevens
30,I guess its all about expectations,"Was really looking forward to visiting this beach. But being accustomed the grand strand Atlantic Ocean beaches that are huge with amazing sand, this was a let down. Beach is long, but so small in width. Waves weren't big the day we visited so no surfers were out. Sunset was pretty, but once again the beach itself is just ok.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/booknook9121

40,"Nice, long, wide beach","Wish we had found this one earlier during our week-long stay in Malibu. Very nice, long, and wide beach, great sand for walking. The panoramic view of the beach as you approach it from the highway is beautiful. Unlike neighboring Dume Point, it has facilities, which were very clean. We visited towards the evening, so there was adequate parking and no crowds. Time permitting, of all the beaches, we would have returned to Zuma to hang out for a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lost175lbs

50,Great place for a run,"If you're staying in the area and looking for an awesome spot for a run, try Zuma beach and Point Dume State Park. If you're there off season you'll have no problem parking and you can run the beach and/or sidewalk for a good distance. It's flat, but sometimes windy, and the views are great. If you cross the bridge on the north end you can run on Broad Beach Rd. past $10+ million beach homes. Worth the drive over if you're staying on the other side of the canyon. In season the parking is not as easy, but the beach scenery is even better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skodie
50,Beautiful Beach!,"Zuma beach might be my favorite Malibu beach ever. It's clean and pretty with plenty of parking (for a fee of course!) and had some pretty decent looking lifeguards :)We ended up coming here twice while staying in Agoura Hills, and I loved it! We went there at night on a Sunday to see the sunset and the beach was all but deserted, which was nice. I'll definitely be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WendyLady03
50,Favorite Malibu Beach for Valley Folks,"Grew up in Santa Monica so, we rarely ventured out this far in to Malibu. It wasn't until we moved to the Valley that we started coming here. We're only 25 minutes from Zuma so we usually come 2 to 3 times a week during the summer months. We normally go to station 12 and we always run in to our neighbors and friends from the west valley. We like to come around 9:30 or so in the morning to get free parking on PCH and usually stay till around 4 or so. My 12 year old daughter can boogie board for hours with her friends. Bring a cooler with some drinks and food, umbrella and chair and it's paradise. The sand is always raked in the morning and the lifeguards are always on duty during the summer months. You would think June through August would be the best here but June is quite gloomy until past noon, July is hit or miss and August can get real crowded even during the weekdays. September and October is probably the best time to come here. No overcast and no crowds and the water is warmest in September (upper 60's). By far the best beach in all of Malibu and perhaps the entire SoCal coastline.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonK935
40,an Aussie must do,for Aussies Hollywood is a the place to visit until u get to SoCal. malibu is nice & would go here & Santa Monica over Hollywood any day. the day we picked was 80 & windy the day before was 90 & perfect. would visit this beach over others in la any day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wok21a

40,Amazing waves and plenty of beach...,"My wife and I are locals, and we spend some time at Zuma during the summer months. The waves are amazing, but be careful if you are not an excellent swimmer, as the rip currents are strong and can pull you under at times!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shaffiqr

50,A great walking beach!,"Zuma Beach is a great walking beach! Depending on the time of year, one can also find lovely seashells. Enjoyable to watch the surfers. On some magical days will see pods of dolphins and whales. Lifeguards are professional, kind, and watchful. Thank you! Terrific sunsets too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Codatrek
40,A view to remember,"Visited on a Friday in November. Parking was $6 cash only and once you leave you have to pay to get back in. The beach was very well maintained with reasonably clean public bathrooms and showers.Volley ball nets are available for summer fun.Even in early November it was quite hot between noon and sun set. Bring your swimwear, shorts, beach blanket, and umbrella; you'll need it to get a great tan. Be prepared for the quick change in temperature when the sun sets, it got chilly quite fast. There are no stores to buy beachwear within reasonable distance but if you shell out the money you can get a few items at the ""market"" convenience store before you enter the beach parking lot.On the Friday I went, the food stores were not open so bring your own food. The beach only had a few scattered people on it so finding a spot on the beach was a breeze.Have a great time out there. Just be prepared with food, clothing, and all the summer fun you can imagine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UHcougarBdaygirl

50,Awesome,"Lovely beach. My roommate and I were excited to swim in the ocean as we are from the Midwest and our lakes are pretty flat.We had a blast! People thought we were crazy for swimming in the cold water (we went in October), but once a comfortable level of numbness set in, it was all good.This is my new favorite beach. Unlike many beaches in LA, there is free roadside parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/349sarab
50,Best Beaches,"This is one of the best beaches in the world with its perfect white sand, great waves and isn't hectic with vendors, performers and tourists like Venice. This is perfect to bring a picnic lunch and have a peaceful, getaway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelSecrets78
50,My Favorite Beach in SoCal!,"I was born and raised a 1/2 mile from Zuma Beach and it has become part of my life. The beach itself is about 3 1/2 miles long if you continue to walk it where it turns into Westward Beach and about 5 miles long if you include Broadbeach. The best time to visit Zuma Beach is September, October and even November. This is the best time of the year for the weather in Malibu and there are virtually no crowds. Fantastic sunsets, year round. You can walk the beach, bike the parking lot, swim and boogie board, surf and skim board to your heart's content. Plenty of paid parking in the lot and ample free parking on P.C.H. and Westward Beach Road. BE CAREFUL and read the NO PARKING signs though, because they will tow your car if you park illegally. In the summer there are food stands at Zuma Beach and there are restrooms at both Zuma and Westward Beaches. There are no fires allowed on any of these beaches, no alcohol either and no overnight parking or camping. The beach is wide, white sand. The perfect beach in Malibu!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZumaDawg
50,South Zuma rocks!,"My favorite getaway by myself or with my girlfriend when we need a break from the heated interior Valleys. It's quiet, relaxing and smaller than main Zuma beach. Dolphins frolic in the waves, brown pelican float overhead...a day spent in paradise will refresh your spirit, so you can face the heat and frenetic daily life!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/239RebeccaR

50,Mountains meet Ocean,"This beach location as stunning views. The mountain backdrop meeting the ocean with the brilliant sun shining is simply paradise.Its fun to people watch and look at the gorgeous ocean front mansions. The beach seemed to be well patrolled with police and lifeguards keeping everyone safe.There was a bare minimum of litter and overall a very clean well kept beach. We were there on a Sunday afternoon and parking was a challenge to find. Cant wait to return, next time we will be sure to show up earlier to avoid any parking difficulties",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NewEnglandTraveler23
40,Zuma Beach - beautiful setting!,The drive was beautiful with the many mansions and smaller homes aligning the beach & mountain. The mountains meet the ocean at Zuma Beach and it is very pretty. The beach itself was uncrowded and clean. Parking was still available in the afternoon (along the road by the beach),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Berginator
40,A great family beach,While it's been awhile since I've visited this beach many of my friends with children post photos of there children playing on this beach. What was good in the past still remains a beach worth going to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samroz
50,What a great beach!,"We are from the East Coast, so this beach was like nothing I had ever seen. The Malibu setting is spectacular (mountains, beach front mansions), the beach itself is clean and manicured, and the waves at high tide are good for surfing. We saw lots of surfers. There were professional lifeguards (not just youngsters working the summer) and Malibu sheriffs on ATV's patrolling the area. It had a big parking lot, two or three bathroom/shower/changing buildings as well as a building selling food. The parking lot cost $8.00. Well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcduane
50,The Best In LA,"There are how many millions of people in LA? You are not going to get a more ""pristine"" beach anywhere south until you get past most of Mexico. Get over the price of parking - it is free if you park on the street. I appreciate the parking lot just for convenience and safety getting in and out. The beach is beautiful and as sparsely populated at you can hope for anywhere on a Southern California beach that is remotely reachable. The mountains behind make a much better backdrop than the constant city anywhere south. It is a bit of a drive so make it worth your while, bring a picknick basket and plenty of beverages - this is not Santa Monica with vendors and cafes lining the streets. Plan on staying a while, watch the waves, they are always active, and catch the sunset. It is good for the soul.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Twistoffcap
50,Wonderful family beach,"Spent a long weekend in the area while husband was there on business. We were advised by our concierge that Zuma Beach would be the closest and least crowded, and they were right. We had spent Sunday morning in LA at the California Science Center and drove a very crowded and busy PCH 1 up the coast. Seeing all the crowds at the other beaches, we were concerned that maybe Zuma Beach would be just as crowded. But we were pleasantly surprised when we arrived that we could easily get into the parking lot and not have to park on the road (although you can do that and save $10 parking). The beach was wide with plenty of space for families and couples, of which there were many there, but there was still plenty of beach available. We grabbed food and drink from the nearby concession and found a spot and sat and enjoyed the ocean waves and watching the families with children. At one point, we moved even closer to the water and were blessed to see a school of dolphins passing by. The beach was a very relaxing and enjoyable place with many lifeguards available. Being from Texas and used to a lot of heat, we enjoyed the coolness of the California coast. However, we were too cold to do anything but dip our toes in the water. I had to put on my long sleeve sweater and bundle up in the middle of August. Still, it was relaxing and enjoyable. We spent only four hours on the beach as we had dinner reservations and needed to return to the hotel to freshen up before meeting our dinner guests. On leaving, we noticed a man being arrested on the other side of the beach near the parking area, but never heard anything but the ocean waves, children playing and happy sounds at this great, sandy beach. Will happily return when in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/victoriaaJ9051BX
10,Bad impression,"We had some high expectations about Maliby and especially about the Zuma beach.I can rate our exerience only 1 out of 10.Dirty washrooms, closed snack bar, we paid $8 for the parking and left after 15 minuts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adrakadabra
40,Better than Santa Monica beach!,Overall a bit cleaner and less crowded. Great view! You will need to pay about $8-10 for the parking. Be sure to bring extra clothes if you plan on staying for the sunset as it can get really cold.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sevani2013
40,"Clean, easy to access beach","This is our favorite beach that is close to us. You can park yourself near restrooms and a lifeguard tower if you have children. We spend full days playing in the water and sand here. Free parking on the street if you can find an available space. If not, pay the $8-$10 to park inside the parking lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TTITL
50,Great rolling waves for bodyboarding!,We came here on a busy Saturday on the recommendation of a local girl we met on Malibu beach who said this was a great place for kids. She was right - the waves are lots of fun and seem to crash close to the shoreline so our young kids could enjoy them even though they are not yet confident swimmers. The beach was clean with plenty of lifeguards on duty and ample parking. Good fun all around!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/881martinh
40,I am a fan!,"Personally I enjoy going to Zuma for a nice afternoon walk. If you are going to be there for your first time, you MUST not limit your experience by stoping at that HUGE rock (south of the beach), believe me when I say that you will want to find out what is on the other side... Ssssshhhhhh...go one... it's worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GunagM
50,A Real Southern California Beach,"This four mile stretch of beach is one of the finest among the 27 miles of Malibu coast. Year round it is a great place to spend a day. During the summer it is best to arrive before 8am to get a decent spot on the beach. During the other seasons, it is easier to get a nice spot. Parking is easy. You can park in designated areas along the south side of PCH or there is a very large lot that is available for a state beach entrance fee of $10. Otherwise the visit to Zuma is free. There is a Chevron station, starbucks and a grocery store directly across the beach on the other side of PCH. The outdoor showers and restrooms are clean and there are plenty of them. On the northern tip of the beach there are tidepools teeming with sea life. One the southern tip there are dramatic cliffs and some rock formation. Also, a great spot to fish. The sunsets here will take your breath away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GenaVazquez73
50,"Beautiful, clean, great for families","Malibu in my opinion may be one of the best places in the United States. The weather always seems to be in the mid to high 70's. Zuma beach is a great place to go with the family. It is very large, very large and very well kept. It was not very crowded when we were there, but I think it was probably because the water was cool. The kids had a great day playing in the sand and running around. My wife and I just enjoyed sitting in our chairs watching the waves hit the shore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hallscotta
50,Beautiful west Malibu beach...,"I am lucky enough to live overlooking this beach, so this really is my go-to-beach. Yes, in the summer it is packed on the weekends! But during the week it's lovely and after Labor Day it slows down on the weekends. This is a classic California beach with great waves, but sometimes the currents can get be a bit strong. But you will be safe--the lifeguards are amazing and in the last 25 years, ""there has been ""two drownings""... and each of those were under very unusual circumstances, and during minimum coverage periods."" My children learned to swim and surf at this beach, even as toddlers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeneferOSEA
50,Zuma Beach,Zuma beach has parking and lifeguards. Much safer for children than the small beaches. Lots of people on weekends. Come during the week and enjoy. This beach is NOT close to the pier. It's about 8 miles north of the pier. Park in the parking lot and avoid running across PCH. Also be careful where you park; they do tow cars parked illegally.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A5564GXcarolinem
50,"Wide, long expanse of beach. In season, whales. Almost daily, dolphins!","There is no pier here. If you want that you need to go to Paradise Cove. What Zuma does have is the ability to walk for miles- all the way to Point Dume and Broad Beach (What's left of Broad Beach...) January through April you are likely to see whales pretty close to shore. Dolphins regularly put on a show. In the summer time, come early to avoid the throngs of cars trying to get into the (plentiful!) parking lot. Highly recommending getting food from Lily's, SunLife, DiMore's Pizza (All located on Point Dume- PCH and Heathercliff) and taking it with you to the beach. Not too much in the way of good food on the beach. Or if you are near Westward Beach, (south end of Zuma Beach) go to the Sunset Room for lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianettewells
50,Nice Retreat,"This is a nice beach with two concessions. If you arrive before 9am, parking is cheaper. If you park along the PCH, make sure you obey signs and park correctly. The beach has lots of room to move and enjoy yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/troym960

40,Crazy busy but better than I remember,I hadn't been to Zuma in about 2 years so it was really nice to see a MUCH cleaner beach & lifeguards at EVERY station & more. Rip currents were strong & they were very attentive & busy pulling people out who got too far in on a crowded weekend.I still don't like the snack shack there-it doesn't appeal to me for eating nor does it have good food.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gerfmeister
20,There are better beaches...!,This is a smaller beach in comparison to many others along the coast...it's all down to personal preference as to whether or not you like it. I personally found it a good beach but I prefer more life going on and restaurants within walking distance etc which this beach doesn't have. It was overcast the whole day I was there...so maybe if it had been sunny I may have viewed it in a different light. I prefer manhattan beach...as it is quieter than Santa Monica beach but there is still things going on and places to eat etc.Good for a peaceful day taking your own food etc. ..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ofey
40,Great waves!!,The beach was clean and very nice. The waves were GREAT for boogie boarding and the lifeguards were very attentive. This is a great family beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GClementAZ
50,"Zuma, Baby","Right on the Pacific Coast Highway lies one of the prettiest stretches of beach in the world.

40,"Nice beach, good for families.","My wife and I spent most of a Thursday at Zuma Beach. No particular reason for going there, we just wanted to sit in cooler weather on a beach somewhere. It’s a really long beach, with lots of parking (for $8). The beach looked busy, but there weren’t that many cars in the lots, so I imagine weekends are crazy here. The crowd on this day was pretty mellow so it was enjoyable. The beach was clean and bathroom/showers are always nearby. There were also some food stands at certain spots along the beach as well as volleyball nets.There were pretty big waves on this beach, definitely enough to boogie board. The lifeguards were pretty active, patrolling the beach rather than sitting in their huts. There was also a lifeguard boat patrolling offshore. Definitely a family kind of beach with all the attention to safety. We also saw dolphins, which was cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunburnt_curt
50,Great Beach,"Zuma Beach is gorgeous. There is free parking along the Pacific Coast Highway. The sand was nice and soft, the views were spectacular, and the beach was super clean. If you're looking for a relaxing afternoon on the beach, I would highly recommend Zuma Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/578LaurenM
40,Great Malibu Beach,"Easy beach access, plenty of parking in paid lot or along pacific coast hwy. Stopped here late in day for a few hours and enjoyed the sandy beach, nice waves and great views.

50,Zuma Beach - Why everyone wants to live in Malibu,"Love this beach. What a great beach. The views are incredible especially in the evenings where you can sit on the sand, have a glass of wine and hear the ocean roar. The sunsets are incredible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/azminak
50,Easy access to the beach makes this great for families,"I've wandered plenty of beaches up and down California, but this has to be one of my favorites. It's clean, has plenty of lifeguards in sight, and is easily accessible. If you go midweek, you can get free parking by parking along pacific coast highway just outside the pay lots. This parking is definitely harder to come by on weekends and during summer but if you go early enough (before 9) there's probably a good possibility of getting a free spot. Like I mentioned before, this ease of getting to the beach is one reason this beach is so great. When you are hauling coolers, chairs, towels, an umbrella, and boogie boards, you'll be thankful for close parking and a short beach stroll to the water. The water has been cleaner as of late and my kids always have a great time here. There aren't many food choices around so pack a lunch or eat beforehand. Sunsets are amazing as you often see windsurfers against a mountain backdrop so bring your camera. If you plan on coming just before sunset, there will be plenty of space and parking as most people pack up about 2 hours before sunset. Since I like photography, this is definitely a go to beach for that as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli

40,Great view of Ocean breakers and Rock Climbers,"This beach is less crowded than other state beaches due to the fact that you have to pay for parking. The lifeguards are very much in evidence, and there are all the needed facilities. Swimming can be dangerous--rip currents, strong undertow and such---so check in with the guard before attempting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BBS-FGS
40,Zuma beach is great for families,"Since there is a no alcohol rule this beach is a natural for families. There is plenty of room to spread out. Beach volleyball or boogie boarding is fun here. You may spot a dolphin or at certain times of the year a whale. It is a clean beach with lifeguard on duty. Sunsets are incredible Go for a walk, wade in the water or juts watch people. Coming from Florida all California beaches seem second best, but a 4 is a fair rating given what is available in the area. Parking fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/998JamesH998
50,Spectacular!,"This is a beautiful strip of soft sand with crashing pacific waves and purple mountains in the distance. This beach is great for long walks to take in the scenery.

50,Large open beach with excellent life guard coverage.,"Zuma is the largest beach in Malibu with excellent visual vistas, decent short-board and boogie board activity and the classic lifeguard towers. It is a great large family gathering spot, has beach volleyball courts and great for walking along the beach. Can be a bit windy in late afternoons.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomassG3669AB
40,Memories,"When I was much younger, Zuma Beach was a favorite place to visit and explore. Going back, recently, wasn't the same type of experience, but the memories were alive again and the visit worth the drive.l",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OfeliaR227
30,Zuma Beach as good as any beach,"Nothing special. Seems like when we give an average rating it's taken as a bad thing. This is not a bad thing at all. Zuma beach is just ok. When I want to go to the beach I'm there. It's not like I'm there saying, ""OMG, I'm at ZUMA BEACH!!!"" I want to hang at a beach to clear my head and do nothing but take in the waves and the sounds and the smell, and I get that at Zuma Beach. Is that enough to make me rate it anything other than average? Not really. It's an ok beach and it does it's job.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sammysawbuck
50,Magical dolphins play in the waves,You can walk along the boardwalk and keep your eyes on the waves. Pods of dolpins can be seen every time I go here. We also spotted a whale passing by. It is a very clean beach with open restrooms to use- even in the winter,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swimdiva
50,The best beach in So Cal,Travel anywhere and you won't find a better beach than Zuma. Run by L A County with great life guards and plenty law enforcement. Leave the beer at home or you'll be sorry Read the parking signs or pay for lot parking. Might be way cheaper than a tow and a citation.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlanB911
40,Nice experience but...,"don't get caught with alcohol, though in Cali, pot is probably ok. The cops walk around with testers and the fine is from 40 to 500 if you have a glass bottle. So just enjoy the scenery and waves, it is worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HFactorLA

I enjoyed staying on the beach, and listening to the radio.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristinaR240

50,Boogie boarding in CA,We received the tip of our vacation while mule riding into the Grand Canyon from another family heading out to CA from CO. They recommended going to Zuma beach for boogie boarding as it had the best waves....we were still sceptive as we drove from Santa Monica northwards...long faces on the kids as they saw no waves. We stopped at Zuma Jays in Malibu to rent the boards and he also said to go the extra miles. Everone's eyes lit up once we got to the beach and saw waves breaking out far enough for a good ride!

50,We got hammered (by the waves)!,"Californians seem to love their beaches - and with good reason, they are beautiful. They also seem to be packed with people all the time. Zuma Beach (and adjacent Point Dume) are no exceptions. We have paid to park at other beaches, but time we did what the locals appear to do and parked on the side of the road. The water was cool and the waves big. They were breaking right on the beach, and we got pounded until we could barely crawl from the surf. The bath houses are a bit rough and in need of repair. And if you look up at the bluffs you can see the many amazing homes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobL42
50,Frankie and Annette Surfed and Played Here!,"Remember Beach Blanket Bingo? It was filmed here. This is one of the Malibu beaches available to the public. My advise is PAY FOR THE LEGAL PARKING. If you park on PCH, with some misleading signs, you may get towed and ruin a great visit. The Beach is ALL SAND, no rocks, and great for body surfing. Brind a boogie board. You can also bring an e-z up, blankets, and food. The life gurads don't allow booze, so be inventive if you must have some. The beach can hold over 250,000 people on a hot day and still not look crowded. After 4pm. the traffic going south on PCH can be bad so plan accordingly.

10,If you only need water and sand,"If you only need water and sand then this place may be OK, even though the water is rough and cold. But having visited many beaches in Europe, Carribean, Hawaii, you realize that this is nothing but just a primitive but overrated beach. It is very hard to find parking on a summer weekend and once you are there, you are stuck. There is no decent place to eat or drink a beer! You don't have to be an alcoholic to need a beer when is hot outside. Come on, everywhere, in the civilized places like French Riviera, Italy, Spain, Greece you can have a drink on the beach and there are many bars and restaurants right there.Why can't we have the same here? The rangers will come and check your coolers, making you feel like a criminal. Does the City of Malibu consider this ""enjoyable""?You can only draw the conclusion that the City does not want you to come here. They will try to make your visit as miserable as possible, while cashing in your parking money.Too bad for a place with such big natural potential...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LATraveller_12
50,Cool like Copacabana,"Zuma beach is huge and clean. Unlike Santa Monica or Venice beaches, the waters and air at Zuma are clean and wildlife abounds. Go to the very end and walk over to the little cove. It's a fantastic place to spend a day. You'll see dolphins, pelicans, beach bunnies. Of all the places in the world I chose this as my backyard, so obviously I'm partial to it ;) But also positive you'll love it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CosmoElf
40,Good family beach,"Nice, clean, family beach. Big parking lot. Very easy to get to from Hollywood. Uncrowded during the week. Decent enough bathrooms and food service. Well supervised. Wide, warm, sandy beach. The cold water was such a surprise to us, we are used to the warmer water of the Atlantic or Lake Michigan. The Pacific is too cold to swim in comfortably without a wet suit, even in August. However, we enjoyed our time here anyway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crazywith3kids
40,Zuma Zuma,"(30 July 2012) Nice beach, with lots of space and lots of people. If you go inside the ""park"", expect to pay eight bucks for parking (or you can park on the outer road for free). The water was a little cold for my taste, but the warm air made it tolerable. Don't go out too far into the water or you may be ""whistled"" back by a lifeguard due to the numerous riptides that were/are present. NOTE: There were many tarballs on the beach that day (hidden by the tide) so many times I didn't know that I had stepped on one until it was too late. Luckily I was wearing flip flops, but they ended up being covered in the petroleum-smelling crap and I had to throw them away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Murray8ch

Parking is easy and the trip there is very scenic, either by taking one of the Canyons from the 101 or PCH all the way.No boardwalk or other distractions... or shade, so if you are making a day of it, be sure to bring a beach umbrella and all the other amenities.One of my best California experiences is body surfing here with Dolphins. It is not uncommon to see them here and they seem to enjoy people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bentheredunthat
50,Zuma Beach,"This is the beach we frequent most often.......BEAUTIFUL, broad sandy beach with sandy bottom. We usually see dolphins and an occasional seal in the water. Once when we were there we even saw a whale just outside of the surf-line!! If you go on top of the rocks at the south end, during Dec-March, you can see the whales migrate. There is a deep water channel in close to shore. They are out probably 500yds or so from shore. Only negative....in areas, the ocean bottom drops off steeply, so many of the waves ""close out"" (break all at once, instead of peel away at an angle). You have to choose a good location for body boarding, but they do exist. Also, it tend to get windy in the later PM (but sometimes not.....if you get lucky).

You can find spot on side of PCH or put up $10 bucks for parking lot. Beach gets lots of people but is big so usually not all over each other. Malibu has more secluded beaches if you want a lot of privacy. Waves here are generally average with lifeguards around to give you tips. Never had a experience here.

There aren't stores to look at or places to buy things. Ideal for people who just like to beach all day. This is pack a bag, pack a lunch, take your toys and chill.Worth checking with the Bay Watch for safer swimming but stay in the shallows and you're good. On the right day its fun waters for boarders etc.Get there early, park on the roadside and its free. But dont leave for lunch and assume you'll get the parking spot back. Regular parking right at the beach so you dont have to drag your stuff far. Toilets and showers OK.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler2504
50,Best Beach in the 'Bu,"Zuma is hands down the best beach in Malibu. You can find parking in the pay lot or, depending upon timing, free parking alongside the access road down by Point Dume. A beautiful beach for a run or a relaxing day in the sun. The water will be chilly, so if it's not summer time you won't want to spend too much time in the surf.

But the urban myth led us to explore this Maiibu coastline with Neil's spirit in our hearts and his music in our heads.

So, I would say be careful walking in the sand. The waves are huge. If you are a surfer, then you will really enjoy this beach. If not, you really cannot go in the water too far as it is very rough. But, absolutely gorgeous views of the water and the mountains. The ladies room was absolutely gross. It was difficult to change as there was feces on the floor. It smelt terrible. I would recommend changing prior to going to the beach. The snack bar was a bit expensive but okay. They do not have chair rentals.

Good coverage by the lifeguards on duty. Bathrooms are clean (but have extremely low partitions) and there is a separate changing area. We prefer the north end of the beach (by the volleyball nets) because it is much less crowded. Further south, the parking lot is much closer to the water but it's also more congested with people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travel-addict2000

50,The perfect afternoon!,"We were recently in Pasadena visiting family, and we wanted to head out to the beaches for an afternoon. We go to California about once a year, so we weren't interested in the more ""touristy"" sites - we just wanted a relaxing afternoon on the beach. My fiance had heard of Zuma Beach, so we headed that way. It was around 4pm, and the beach was not crowded at all. The area we were in was mostly young teenagers, but they were just having good fun and did not bother us in the least. The lifeguards are very friendly and immediately chatted us up once they realized we weren't from the area. They suggested we head to a nearby beach for an awesome sunset view, which ended up being the most amazing part of the trip! Before we left, we grabbed a bite at Zuma Beach Cafe, which is a quaint little beach hut that looks like it's been there untouched since the 60s. The food was pretty decent and reasonably priced, and again, everyone was very friendly. We can't wait to go back to Zuma Beach on our next trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CMT1085
50,One of SoCal's Best,"I am lucky enough to live near Zuma and so go for a walk on it as often as possible (at least once a week). Its a beautiful beach, with lots of parking, but in the summer, it can get crowded and the traffic can be fierce. Its nicest in fall (after labor day) when fewer visitors (and the typically cold pacific--at least by my east coast as a youth-standards go-- is a little warmer) and in spring before it gets to popular. The bathrooms can be gross, but not as bad as others I have seen. And one thing to note, over last couple of years, there has been a beach erosion problem, so its not as wide as it once was, but still bigger than the less accessable beaches up and down coast in LA area (except for Will Rogers and south), and FAR LESS crowded than Will Rogers and most of Manhatten Beach area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DJ1313999

The sand is close to the parking lot ($7.00) which is a boost for those of us who carry a lot of beach stuff. Unlike the restroom facilites, the water is very clean!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chesbeau
40,Fun in the Sun,Zuma is a great beach not too far from the County Line (Los Angeles and Ventura. It costs $7 to park but even on a weekend in the summer you can usually find a place and the park runs along the whole beach so it is never a long walk to or from the car.There are several manned (during the summer) lifeguard stations and a couple of food places to get snack type food. Restrooms are available. The sand is typically clean and the crowd ranges from teenagers to families. There is plenty of beach to play on and the beach is sandy and nice. You can wade out into the waves or boogie board if you like. Bring lots of sun screen and enjoy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoCalFamilyFun
50,Very nice beacn!!!!!!!,"I agree about the bathrooms. The state should allow a little bit more money to pay someone to clean the restrooms more often. But I have seen worst. At least there is toilet paper in the restrooms. We are going again today, we love this beach so much!!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobdylanfan
20,grossest bathrooms,"I just visited Zuma beach - I was on vacation from Massachusetts. I can't believe that none of these reviews reference how disgusting the bathrooms are. The stall doors are only up to your shoulder - I've never seen anything like it - you can look right over into the next stall. But that's only if you're brave enough to wade through the 2-3 inches of dirty water on the floor to get to the stall. There is no soap at the sinks, so I wonder, where do the snack bar employees wash their hands??",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dlmon124
50,beautiful this time of year,"Zuma, is the ultimate tourist destination for Malibu beach wise. It is large, lots of facilities. There are 5 restaurants within walking distance. Sunset Restaurant is a great happy hour place on the South end of Zuma. Parking is easy. Pay the extra dollars to park inside. I see accidents all the time for parking along the road. Whales are here right now. They will be coming through for the next 60 or so days. Nothing like it! There is one small hotel close and another within a mile. Nothing to right home about but what a way to wake up in the morning and walk Zuma!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maverickinwine
50,Best Beach in L.A. County,"I've lived in L.A. for 15 years and this is the beach I go to all the time. Zuma is a huge beach, long and deep. It is a great place to take kids. Tons of parking. Lots of changing facilities and showers. Very clean water. Decent surf (better for boogie-boarding and body-surfing than surfing). Not very commercial. There are some food stands which I've never eaten at. I recall a single temporary rental place for boards and blades. etc. There's a boardwalk along almost the entire length. There are plenty of life guard towers in the summer and early fall. The water is cold, except in August and September. A body suit can be a good idea. Particularly during the summer, I prefer to arrive early and leave early to beat the traffic and get a good parking spot.It actually quite nice in the off-season on a clear day. In the summer, remember in May-July, there can be a very heavy early morning haze. Don't forget your sunscreen even on those days. Also, during the off-season, I recommend heading down to Pointe Dume for a hike up the cliffs overlooking the Santa Monica Bay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HitchKennedy
40,eating here,This beach does not have a place for picnics (grills) but its a great place to sit back and relax or take a long walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WithFamily4
50,beautiful zuma,"Zuma is a beautiful beach, wonderful for a run, walk, swim or just enjoying the beach and oceanside views. A beautiful beach with a lot to enjoy, I highly recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Road15290
