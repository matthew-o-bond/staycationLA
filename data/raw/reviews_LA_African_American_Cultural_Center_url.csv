30,Worth a visit but inadequate chronicle of African American history,"Was pleased to learn that LA is home to a museum dedicated to African American history, though was surprised on the small scale of the museum when we visited. Undoubtedly some important artefacts and key chronicles of note but the museum mainly centres on key historical figures such as MLK and prominent church leaders which we felt didn't do the rich and complex history of African Americans anywhere near justice. Whilst the exhibits / written commentary does outline the contributions of some significant African Americans in the shaping of the USA and also California since the 1800s, so much was left unsaid particularly in view of the latter 20th and early 21st century.The museum appears somewhat neglected and a victim of a lack of funding and imagination - you only need to visit the science museum next door to see the contrast (we didn't visit the natural history museum).Given the tensions in race relations in LA and the U.S. in general, the celebration of and teachings of comprehensive African American history should have its rightful place. A museum alone doesn't fix all social and cultural ills born out of the dodgy social construct of 'race' but a good museum does go some way in challenging and changing perceptions. The museum of tolerance is a notable example.Disappointing and sad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/965carlap
