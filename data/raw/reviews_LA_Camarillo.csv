20,Citadel outlet is better,This outlet is bigger than citadel but much far away from los angeles. The shops are next to each other but in the middle is the car parking area. From one side you can not see good the other side and see what shop is on the other side. The food court was okay but there were no special deals the prices are nearly same as in retail.,Yasemin Y
40,If you love shopping then this is for you,"Coming from Australia we always love shopping in the US as things are always cheaper and will always seek out a Premium Outlet Mall. Even with our Aussie dollar not as strong as it used to be you can still find great bargains here. It is over an hours drive from LA but if you are a shopper then it's worth it.It is very spread out so be prepared for a lot of walking so wear comfortable shoes. There are a great range of shops but we found towards the end as walked through every section, there were at times 2 or more of the same store. We spent 7 hours shopping and it's a nice place to shop if you are on the hunt for good deals although they could do with a few more places to find something to eat.",Karen G
40,Fun Shopping at Camarillo,We did some shopping in Camarillo. They have a good variety of stores to shop at and is one of the better premium outlet shopping centers.,mini
40,Camarillo Outlet Shopping,"The perfect place for a day of shopping. Although quite far (since we came from Redondo Beach) it was quite worth the trip. Although not much places to eat despite the size of the place, there was a food court which still serves the basics and enough to keep you going around the place. The Nike store was insane and packed with people, a testament of the good deals you can find. Going around, there were a lot of good deals as well as items/styles which you would not normally find. SInce my wife was pregnant, we were able to get a wheel chair for her which made going around easy for her. Overall I would rate this as a nice place to shop in LA if you are in a hunt for good deals.",Gablopez33
20,Camarillo Outlet... I did not like it...,"I took a shuttle tour to this place as I have no car here. It was on a Friday and we had not much traffic (surprisingly), so we arrived there in about 45min. This outlet is very wide spread and I had to walk quite a lot to get to all my favorite shops. There are a lot of shops, which is a good thing of course, but as it is that wide spread, it gets annoying walking from one to another. I definitely will not return here and don't recommend it.",Marijana P
40,Camarillo = outlet,"Here is the perfect place for shopping. A long drive, almost one hour from LA, but at least you can find everything with free parking in a single place. All brands are there, and it is ideal for those that want to concentrate all long list purchases in a day with reasonable prices. If you are just looking for a couple of items, better go to Macy's or any other store close to your hotel in the city. Don't expect great food there.",Fabio Steinberg
