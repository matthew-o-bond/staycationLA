30,One of LAâ€™s best boulevards,"This is one of the nicest boulevards in LA. As others have suggested you really should check it out outside the rush hours in LA. Comparing to nice boulevards elsewhere in the world it is average at best but for this city it is exceptionally nice boulevard. There are good cafeterias, restaurants and shops on both side of this street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeachStone2C
50,Best Sushi Ever,"I have been coming to this restaurant since it's opening over 10 years ago. This restaurant is Katsuya by Stark. It is in Brentwood not to be confused with Katsuya. They are not affiliated.The restaurant is beautiful, truly a work of art. The service and consistency of the food is flawless. My favorite dishes are the corn crunch roll, The special albacore roll, Spicy tuna with salsa, albacore tuna with crispy onion rings. You will not be disappointed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lshaw3010
40,Ocean to Westwood Drive ....,"San Vicente is the East-West thoroughfare of Santa Monica, Brentwood and to Westwood. For LA, it has to be ranked as a quite beautiful street due to the grassed & Coral Tree studded central divider, an area always filled with walkers, runners and dog walkers. Traffic is near bumper-to-bumper from 4-7 PM, so use an alternate if possible. Best to drive it on Saturday or Sunday, it's glorious! Enjoy.m...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
10,"Never consider this choice,","The entrance said it all with its instant looks of no body wanted to clean it space.After being shown the suite which had on its deck that had recliners that had holes the size of your head in the plastic weave. Impossible to lye or sit on.Inside the room it smelt moldy and as for the bathroom which you would need to wear footwear to avoid the filth.

30,Misleading,"San Vicente Boulevard, like many Los Angeles streets, covers a lot of territory. It runs through neighborhoods trendy, posh and poor. Traffic is heavy. Avoid unless you have identified something on this street that you want to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmichaelVentura
