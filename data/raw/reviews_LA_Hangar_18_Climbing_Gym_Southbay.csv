50,Fantastic Climbing Gym,"This is an amazing indoor climbing gym. It is very reasonably priced, the staff are amazing guys, and we have a blast every time we come. It's open all the time, and if you get the monthly membership you can come as much as you want, whenever you want. It's a complete life saver during school vacations and rainy/cold days.",Lindsay S
10,Don't Bother Unless You Are An Advanced Rock Climber,"We were highly disappointed with our experience at Hanger 18. I purchased the Groupon package which included a 1 hour lesson, all necessary rock climbing gear, and unlimited climbing after the lesson for two people. I called to verify that they were open and then headed there. When we arrived half the gym rock climbing area (the beginner area) was closed for cleaning which they did not mention when I called. Even worse, after waiting 15 min. for someone to come to the desk to help us we were told that our Groupon package would not work for my 12 year old son even though the coupon specifically stated that 13 years or younger were included as long as they were accompanied by and adult (me). They offered me a voucher to come back with someone else. I had never rock climbed before but my son had just come back from a week trip to Joshua Tree where he did rock climbing every day and he had wanted show me all he had learned so there was no way I was taking someone else. We stayed and waited another 1/2 for someone to give me my lesson which instead of the 1 hour promised in the Groupon, he spent under 5 minutes with me and then we were on our own. As a beginner who was left with only a few advanced rock areas to climb it was a complete waste of my $$$$ and my son was left extremely disappointed. I tried to make the best of it as my son had been looking so forward to going. He had wanted to have his birthday party there until we had this terrible experience. We will never go back. It was so unorganized and the staff seemed like the customers were a bother to them.",Momsperception
40,Good membership rates for kids,"The staff is very helpful. The monthly memberships for kids are really affordable. There is always plenty of parking, which is a plus in any beach city.",SeaJenniTravel
40,Can accommodate the serious climber,This Gym is conveniently located and had sufficient climbing surface area and route variety to provide a workout for a serious climber (It is home to a decent competitive team). Also well ventilated and plenty of parking.,Tina W
