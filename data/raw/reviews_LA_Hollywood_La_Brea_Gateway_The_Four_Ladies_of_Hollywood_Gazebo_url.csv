30,Four Silver Ladies,"There is silver sculpture of four statues at the west end of Hollywood's Walk of Fame. The statues are four screen legend actresses support a Eiffel Tower-like with ""HOLLYWOOD"" lettering on each side. The four silver stars are: Dolores Del Rio, Dorothy Dandridge, Mae West, and Anna May Wong.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pkh_travels
30,Good way to start your walk of fame route,While the structure here isn't worth going out of your way to see it does make for an easy meeting spot and helps you start your walk of fame viewing. It's not a major attraction but it does have the Beatles Walk of Fame here at the start. Only worth seeing if nearby already.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jesselodge
20,Not all that,At the end of Hollywood Boulevard - nearest Madame Tussauds - you’ll find this sculpture of four silver lady statuettes. It is a monument to mark one end of the Walk of Fame and appears ornately crafted. Not terrifically inspiring nor interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gkw09
50,Very cool!,"At the start (or end) of the walk of fame STARS, we came across this beautiful homage to the ladies of Hollywood, plus Marilyn Monroe on top, the cherry on the cake! Hollywood boulevard isn't that long a street when it comes to what to see so start here, and enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielTripLaVie
30,If statues interest you check it out while exploring the Walk of Fame,If you are checking out the Hollywood Walk of Fame you will come across this statue at the La Brea Avenue end of it. It was a decent statue to see while i was already in the area but it's not all that exciting to go out of the way for.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodyt4130
30,A bit gaudy,This statue is a bit gauche - it's nothing special itself. There are several stars out here with extremely tentative links to Hollywood; only worth seeing as part of the whole length of the WofF.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/snowythepyro
20,Nothing much to see,"Despite being the start (or end, depending on where you begin) of the Hollywood walk of fame, there is nothing to do here other than look for 30 seconds. It’s the walk of fame that is the good part. The gazebo doesn’t add anything the party!On the walk you can find your favourite actors and artists. Here is just a few that I took pictures of",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emjordan02
30,Go for Elvis and the Beatles,The Elvis and Beatles stars are here so worth passing through here as you walk round the Walk of Fame. The statue itself is nothing to write home about.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wombling_Free_7548
40,End of walk of fame,"End of walk of fame Hollywood. Easy to find, just go to intersection of La Brea and Hollywood blvd. Look statue with care and you'll find Marilyn Monroe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mmikko
20,Nothing to see here folks,The official beginning of the walk of fame. It honors the international women of Hollywood and it's where the Beatles and Elvis's stars are. Things get much more interesting as you travel east along the Blvd.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/436stug
40,Hollywood gate,Not too much to say. I was a bit disappointed. I was expected something more impressive. It could be any Street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MalavajeGo
40,Cool for a picture.,Iconic landmark in Hollywood that is in a good position to start the tour to completing the Hollywood walk of fame walk to see all of your favourite celebrities!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackmoore93
20,Well i's nice to look at.,"Poor tourists, they make it sound like a big event, but truly just a lovely statue. It's not bad, but there's really nothing else to it really.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebeccaJ805
40,Gateway to Hollywood Walk of Fame ...,"The Gateway of the 4 Ladies (Classic Movie Stars) is a sculptural piece which is the starting point, or ending point, for the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Interesting to make a quickie photo visit & then keep on touring Hollywood. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
30,Start of the walk of fame,"I didn't particularly like the statue, although the theme is good - a tribute to the diverse women who contributed to the Hollywood movie industry. There weren't many people down this far end of the boulevard when we came around 3pm. The most famous part of it is that this is where the Beatles and Elvis's stars were moved so they could be together.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Belgo96
30,just a quick stop,"This is a quick 5 minute stop. There isn’t much to do but get out and take a few snap shots. It’s really not worth going out of your way to see it but a cute pic if you happen onto it. If you take a tour of LA, they will undoubtedly drive right past it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3743BSdaniela
30,Nice art,At start of the stars the Beatles star is there and elvis. Nice bit of art not much to see. If your going for walk of fame go early as gets busy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davglafferty
30,Nice Art,We stopped by there after walking up and down the Walk of Fame. Those statues are pretty cool to look at and basically are the beginning of the walk of fame. Decent place for a few pics and enjoy the scenery.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveRainville99
50,Art,A super neat hollywood icon art sculpture along the hollywood blvd street great for learning about women in the hollywood movie industry and great photo opertunities,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luna6373
30,The silver ladies,"This is a public art display created by film director Catherine Hardwicke. Its a gazebo of sorts and the sculpture is a tribute to the diverse women of Hollywood. The silver ladies supporting the structure represent Mae West, Dorothy Dandridge, Anna Mae Wong and Dolores Del Rio. Its a good photo opportunity and a rather quiet corner even on a busy sunday when went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrestonGuild
20,Ugly.,"This is one of the more lame-brained ideas that the tourist gods have come up with. Take a perfectly mundane corner on the far end of Hollywood, erect an ugly structure....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmichaelVentura
