20,The tour is more about the Rose Bowl and Parade than the house.,"If you've come to see the house, understand that this is primarily a working environment for the Tournament of Roses Association. You will be seeing a few rooms of architectural interest but it's really more about the Association and it's activities.It reminded me of the tour the Scientologists give in Hollywood of their beautiful old property where you're forced to listen to a lot of stuff you don't really care about to hear the stuff you probably do care about. It's a marketing opportunity for the Tournament of Roses given by volunteers in the off season (summer).You also come to realize how long it took them to include people of color or women (apart from the pageant) in the organization.",David L
40,Beautiful rose garden and home,We drove by at 8 pm and walked the grounds peacefully and enjoyed the rose garden and walked around the house. Lovely grounds to see in great neighborhood. Visit during business hours and you can visit the official Tournament of Roses office.,Thomas W
50,Gorgeous and Historic,We can't wait to participate in the Mansion tour that is given on Thursdays. We walked around the garden and fantasized about hosting a party at this beautiful venue. Enjoy!,Nancy
40,rest and relax!,"a garden is a garden and no more, nothing is special here and you can enjoy your stay here for sure and advice you to come for relax and go away from the noise of the city centre",kite m
40,Beautiful Mansion!,Gardens and Mansion in a beautiful neighborhood of Pasadena. Absolutely worth checking out if you are in the area!,misopiso88
30,Scenic stop,While you are in Pasadena you will certainly visit Orange Grove Boulevard and you should also stop and view the beauty of the Wrigley Gardens on S. Orange Grove. Nice stop.,buffalojim67
50,Wonderful Roses,"Great garden and interesting history. Yes, it was the gum guy, Wrigley. Check it out. It is small, so it is quick.",Salvatore F
30,Sad roses but nearby Arlington Gardens is Fantastic and Free,"We saw the gardens during peak rose season and in spite of there being many healthy and floriferous rose bushes, it seemed very lackluster. The roses were healthy and well-grown but the garden seems almost sterile and unloved. Our favourite gardens are Huntington (Jan 2018 fabulous new entry walkway and fabulous desert garden in bloom) and Arlington Gardens (free, stunning design, fabulous plants individually and as collections, maintained by community volunteers who must be dedicated, skilled and passionate gardeners.)",Jane S
30,Small garden areas,"Small garden area with some sad looking roses. Granted it isn't summer but expected more as this is the rose bowl parade capital. Most roses weren't identified, some were. Next time would bring a book and sit and read. Lovely area with beautiful houses and yards.",LodiDazzles
20,"If driving by, keep on driving!","After visiting the Gamble House in Pasadena, the Wrigley Mansion was a great disappointment. Most of the original interior of the house has been gutted and the furniture removed/lost to make conference rooms and office space, and it is now used as headquarters for the organizers of the Rose Bowl Parade. The garden is a rather small area of about 50 square yards planted with many varieties of roses next to a plaque identifying when a particular variety won the rose contest. More appropriate for college football fans (room full of helmets of winning teams). Pleasant but not impressive.",mongoose1950
50,Driving By!,"I pass by this Palace almost weekly. It is so refreshing to see a surviving example of Old Pasadena. Back when this was really Millionaires row.(In the days of the Robber Barons, from say 1850 to 1930. A Million Dollars was worth about 200 to 300 million Dollars today)All I can say is that the Gardeners have done a fantastic job! As its a peek into what paradise must look like. One of these days. I must get my act together and take the Boss on a tour of it. Whenever the time comes free for us.",David L
40,The gardens are a lovely short fresh air visit,"The Wrigley House is open only on Thursday afternoons. The gardens are just a short walk from the TOWN and still capture the aura of a stately garden surrounding a large home. A short stroll circumnavigates the mansion. Azaleas and other spring bloomers were beautiful. Exterior of the mansion gives a good idea as to what is inside. The extension of the house to accommodate the ""Tournament of Roses"" facilities adds nothing to the experience.",goletagone
40,Lovely place to get away from the hustle and bustle of Old Town,"This lovely rose garden is just a short walk from Old Town, but it seems miles away. It was very peaceful on a Sunday morning and even in October, most of the roses were in bloom. If you want to get a bit of exercise, and see some beautiful architecture and gardens, take a short stroll up Colorado to Orange Grove Blvd. to the Tournament of Roses headquarters, and enjoy a relaxing respite in this pretty garden.",PrimroseLlane
40,Interesting home,"Built by Wrigley in 1929 and later donated to the Tournament of Roses, this 18,000 square foot house can only be seen by guided tours which are free. Visitors are given an excellent tour by friendly and knowledgeable guides. The house has displays about past Rose Bowl games and the Rose Queens. The gardens can also be seen and are quite nice. Well worth a visit.",kagatlin
50,Worth the Time - Very Nice,"We were lucky being in the area on a Thursday when the free tours of the Wrigley home are offered at 2 & 3 pm. Tour is about an hour long and covers both floors of the house along with an 8 minute introductory movie. Nice exhibits of the parade and the history of the Rose Bowl college football game. Photo below is Mrs. Wrigley, the dining room which is the only room with original Wrigley furniture and of the front door which is 4"" thick mahogany. All of the different types of roses were blooming in the garden. Even our kids who are 10 and 13 really enjoyed it. Would definitely recommend a visit!",Jeff M
50,Beautiful & loved the historical aspects as well!,"We stopped here on our way to Oregon. It was on a Wed. so we didn't get to do the tour of the home. The grounds are beautiful - lots of roses in full bloom. The people we encountered were very nice and helpful. I didn't realize until stopping that this is the actual Tournament of Roses headquarters. We love watching the game and parade every year, and so seeing this was fun for us. We only spent 45 minutes as we were passing through, but you could easily spend 1-2 hours.",chai44
40,Doublemint Gardens ...,The rose gardens at the Wrigley estate are pleasant to walk through this time of year with Roses in bloom. We like to wander the paths and areas. Very picturesque. Can also tour the Wrigley mansion if time allows. Nice pastoral aside when visiting Pasadena. ...,David B L
40,Roses in full bloom,"It's not huge, but it's worth a short stop to smell the roses, most of which are labeled. We saw a number of new varieties including tea roses and climbers. House was closed though, limited hours.",TravelLightOften
50,Roses and more roses,"This is a great place to visit if you want to smell the roses. From spring to June there are lots of roses. Because they have so many different type of roses they always have roses blooming, but most grow around April/may.This is a small place, you can view it in minutes or stay longer and read all the rose's names",lxjuarez
50,Roses Abound,"Part of the Tournament of Roses headquarters, the ground are lovely and the sense is that these folks really know flowers",burkeohio
50,More than a garden,"OK, full disclosure - I am a docent at the Wrigley mansion. I thought I would write a review and give some helpful information.The real attraction here is the House. It is open for public tours from February through August on Thursday afternoons at 2 pm and 3 pm. If you visit at those times you can take a free tour that lasts about an hour. The tour covers the building of the house, the Wrigley's (the main occupants when it was a residence) and the history of the Rose Parade and Rose Bowl game. The main floor maintains the look and feel of a residence during the time of the Wrigley's. The tour also includes the 2nd floor which is mostly conference rooms now but has a small museum about the Rose Bowl.The gardens themselves aren't much to see. The gardens that were there when the Wrigley's owned the home have mostly been removed. You can see a rose garden (which looks best in late spring) and there are some original plantings on the north side of the house. You are free to stroll around the yard even when there are no tours.At one time this street was called ""millionaire's row"" and was all mansions for its length. The Wrigley mansion is one of the few remaining houses. The others that offer public tours are the Gamble house and Fenyes mansion (part of the Pasadena Museum of History).I hope to see you at a tour!",So_Cal_Illini_81
30,Nothing Special,"The outside gardens were okay, but nothing spectacular, perhaps this is due to the summer heat, but I would not make a special trip out to see the gardens unless you planned to tour the house as well.",Brooke N
40,Good history,Good historical landmark for a well known family pool of the rich and famous. It's good size house in the beautiful city of Pasadena which is now the headquarters of rose bowl event.,Jose C
50,The parade starts hereüíê,We booked a tour of this house and we are glad that we did. It seems like you can tour the house only on certain days so you must plan in advance. The house is beautiful holds a lot of history. They will show you a little about the parade and the history of it . It was well worth while. I felt the garden was average and would have been disappointed if I just came to see the garden . Take the tour of the house!,Mike p
40,Rose Parade,Neat little spot nestled in the city with authentic charm and history. Roses are beautiful and easy to get to.,ocjohnyb
50,Gardens,"Beautiful rose gardens and gorgeous house with a wonderful informative guide.Many historic homes you are quite restricted, but in this house you were actually allowed to feel thing. If you are a football fan, the second floor has all the rose bowl memorabilia.",mutzeraz
40,Great Rose Bowl & Parade History,"Loved seeing the Wrigley House inside and out and enjoyed the history tour, set up throughout the 2 story house. Also saw a short video of the history.",K D
50,"Small, easy to cover and free!",This is a gorgeous garden on the grounds of the Tournament of Roses house on Orange Grove Blvd. My husband and I had his 78 year old mother who doesn't like to walk a lot with us and were looking for something easy to do in Pasadena. On a whim we popped in and loved this! So many gorgeous roses in one place! It was great to be able to walk around the beds and look and smell so many varieties of roses in one setting without the large botanical garden setting to navigate. We probably spent 20-30 minutes enjoying this beautiful setting.,whiningyapper
30,A small rose test garden,I was a little disappointed by this garden which really amounts to nothing more than a small test garden for roses which are laid out in rows. Not very big and not an especially attractive layout.,phebert
50,a beauty,"Im glad I took some time out to stop here. They are only open certain hours so call before you go. But it is worth taking a look at. Being orginaly from Chicago, of course I wanted to go. Even if your not it is worth looking at. It is a historic beauty",Dorothy
50,Worth a stop,"The old Wrigley mansion is now used as the headquarters for the Rose Bowl Parade. Surrounding the mansion are some really nice gardens, especially the rose gardens.",PopTopBob
50,The best ice skating experience in LA!,"Love this place,it's 1 benefit above all lots others to live in Pasadena!ven if you visit LA and stay in nice hotels in sohe pasadena,it used to be ritz but i think it's changed now,but still is nice to stay there and get the taste of living in Pasadena,take your kids and family ice skating here,is amazing!",KhatM
50,See the Roses,The Rose Garden is lovely and worth the stop. The house is closed after August to ready for the Rose Parade. But the gardens are there to walk through. Many different colors and well laid out.,lavonnemy
