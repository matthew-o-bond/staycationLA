50,Nice new look,"We haven't been over for a movie in awhile so, seeing new bar and improved seating was great! Nice to see they still have AARP specials and pricing! I really like this theatre!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/6halleh
50,Awesome place,"Great movie theater close to the valley. Nice clean movie theater and comfy black recliner chairs and food tray available with the chair.Retro style inside the movies which is so cute.I love the prices here cheap and good portions.I also love the bar, many beer and drink options at a reasonable price. The lady that made my black berry mojito was so nice and she definitely poured a GReat AmountOnly 8 minutes from Encino will definitely be comming back here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debbiedeb999
50,"If you'd like a ""New Feel"" To Cinema...",...then this is your place. It just has an elegant feel to it. We drove up from LA just to see a movie here. Plenty of Granite and class. It's high end cinema at it's best. Definitely worth a drive from LA just to see it. Also got a kick out of all the Bentley's and high end cars parked in the lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Crupi
50,Awesome recliner seating!,"My fav theater! Great kick back recliner chairs! Super clean, great sound system and has a bar so you can enjoy a glass of wine with your movie! What more can you ask for?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4redwine
50,My go-to theater for films,Extremely comfortable and convenient. Easy access parking and multiple places to dine before or after the film in the Commons. The theater itself is staffed with a young friendly team and good service at concessions. The seating is extremely comfortable and perfect for any film. They usually ensure a high quality experience however I’ve been there when they forget to turn on the projector at times.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MooshLA

40,Very good but short of great,"This was my go-to theater of choice until AMC Fallbrook did a makeover with those luscious leather recliners. Still, a nice theater when not overrun by teens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RealScorz
30,Pricey upgrade,This theater needed a revamp to compete with the newer ones popping up and serving meals and alcohol all while you lounge in comfort.I would say they spent a little to charge a lot and haven’t quite figured out how to make the bar area seamless (or not frustrating) to grab your 3 oz glass of wine for $14.So while this theater is convenient it’s not my favorite around town.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DinaH733
50,Excellent Surprise!!,"Yyyyaaaaaasssss!!!This theatre was a surprise when we walked in and the seats were so fancy—it’s the reclining type AND there’s a little table for ea seat to set your snacks/food on.The pricing is comparable to other theatre w/ the usual kind of cinema seats. If that’s the case, pffft, we’ll be coming here from now on! Haha!The popcorn tastes good, too! Plenty of salt avail (unlike a particular competitor that uses salt shakers that are usually empty :-/ ) but the last couple times we’ve been there, no napkins, boo...At this location, they also have a little bar to the side of the concession. I can see where some parents would opt to take their kids here, haha!! :PThe service of all team members have been friendly and nice so far—that’s always a plus these days!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Siam255
40,Ccmfy seats,This is my favorite place to go to the movies around here......amazingly comfortable reclining seats. Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that the movie choice isn't always great. Delicious crispy popcorn.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sallylilies
50,The Commons,This theater offers stadium seating and is in a fun location. Have dinner from several of the surrounding restaurants and check out the turtle oasis.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sweetmaker2016
50,Soooo! Comfy !!!,"OK, you say, it's just the movies. Well, The Edwards Calabasas is a bit more. First,no lines for tickets when you purchase them on-line AND pick the seats you want.Then, when you reach your seat there is loads of room......and those chairs.......actual lounge chairs......yep, feet up, back reclines, and the seats are very cushy!!! A small attached tray w/ cup holder for those extra munchies, too. Watch out.... you might fall asleep at these movies!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/957janeb
40,Comfy seating,"Been here a few times, the people are nice, the seats are comfortable. Food is the same as most theaters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hockeymom91302
50,"Clean, spacious and comfortable theatre",Very nice theatre with comfortable seats that recline. Very clean and spacious isles. Easy to find seats and you don't feel cramped inside. You feel very relaxed and can actually fall asleep in the seats.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helenl653
40,Nice Theatre,"Very nice theatre tucked away in commons mall in Calabasas. Clean, good service, overall nice theatre. Next closest is AMC in woodland hills or Thousand Oaks. Great location for those of us nestled in the hills of Calabasas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zzixor1
40,"Comfortable, reservable, reclining seats","Now that all seats are reservable, and have been changed to the reclining seats, it is much more comfortable here. Each seat has a small pull out table for refreshments. The line for snacks and drinks can get huge, so watch out for that if you're in a hurry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bdkLosAngeles
50,"Beautiful theater, great locale and parking with great restaurants in the area.",This is a gorgeous theater with incredibly comfortable power recliners. There is ample parking but it could get very crowded. Surrounded by great restaurants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/927ritchiel
50,Great movie theatre with reclining seats,Enjoy a movie in the comfort of reclining seats. They have first run movies. The bathrooms and theatre are kept clean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Romance2016
40,Excellent cinema,"Good parking. Easy to buy tickets. All very clean. Friendly staff. Dory movie was cool, especially for the teenagers. Good restaurants & shops afterwards. Go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigblueAl
50,Great theatre,The seats recline. The theatres have tiered seating and every seat is a good one. Attendants check sound quality before movies begin. Concession stand has lots of options. But the reclining seats and leg rests make this a true treat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndreaMichaels1214
50,Perfect venue to watch a good movie...,Edwards is a excellent venue to watch a movie. The environment is more like being in a really good media room at home than going out. Uber-comfortable reclining seats set the tone. Good acoustics and easy access to the concessions. Easily the nicest theater I have visited anywhere in California.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vwilburn_3
50,Really Cool Theater!,"It's been a while since I've been here, but each time I have gone it has been great. The seats are very comfortable and it's very relaxing. What's also great is that there is plenty of parking, and once you get out of the theater there are plenty of great places to go sit, chat, and have a drink, get food, desert, or just coffee. It truly is the best place to go to the movies!! It's not just how nice the theater is, but having the convenience of everything at your finger tips!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Secondavenue
50,First Class,This is a wonderful movie theater in an upscale neighborhood with free parking!!! The seats are very comfortable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susangK9032XX
50,A delightful outing at the movies,The lounge seating with legs up has spoiled me with not wanting to frequent any other theatre that does no have same. We are able to reserve seats ahead of arriving at theatre and merely allow the usher to scan our cell phone and walk right in to the movie,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/888philipg
50,Plush lounge seating with foot rests!,"Ever since the remodel, this is my fave movie theater in the West Valley. They took out more than half the seats to replace standard chairs with big, comfy lounge chairs with push button recline and foot rests. Swivel tables too, so might as well wear your jammies and slippers for total comfort. Shows here never seem to be sold out (screw you, Arclight) and concession lines are never long. TIP: share a large popcorn with a friend and they'll refill it for free.Also on the plus-side, despite this being in richy-rich Calabasas, I've never seen a Kardashian here. (Alec Baldwin and Howie Mandel, yes. Kreepy Kardashians, no.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/realfoodfan
50,My favorite place to screen a film.,"To understand best, I get invited to advanced free screenings for most films however I still prefer to watch movies at this location as it offers such a comfortable experience thats never overcrowded. The seats are lazy-boy type recliners along with a sliding table. The rows and seats are places so it truly feels like a private screening room. The audience base is ideal as well - so sick of seeing films elsewhere with people that have no respect for one another. Not the case here - they patrol the theaters and the staff truly cares about the experience. Assigned seats make this a truly ideal film lovers location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MooshLA
40,comforts of home,"Calabasas has a no-teens-out-without-an-adult-after-10PM, which makes the environment so much better in the late evening. We have all been teens, so we know how obnoxious we were. Enjoy the movie with adults, in the amazing huge and comfy seats. Reserved seats means no more hit or miss views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/808stays
40,Best kept secret for movie watchers,"This movie theater Rocks! Best in over 100 I have been to.And the best part is the Reclining seats,makes you feel better than being at home.I want to see more movies only here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bestravler808
50,"Good Movies, Great Stadium Seating","You'll love what they've done to the Theater! The seating is all revamped, and the viewing experience is enhanced. We love this theater and make it a point to visit there at least twice a month.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sonova_Beach
50,VERY GOOD PLACE TO WATCH A MOVIE,"My wife, brother-in-law, and myself caught a movie at this location recently. The staff are friendly, the concession items are pretty good, and the recliner seating is excellent. The theater itself is also clean and well-maintained overall. I would highly recommend this location when you need to catch a movie in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevencH4861VJ
