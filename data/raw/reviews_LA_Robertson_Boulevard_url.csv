50,Rockin' Robertson!,"I was practically raised on Robertson Blvd, my mother having been an interior designer. So I've seen many years of changes there. The one thing that has not changed, though, is the charm of all the small storefronts, no matter who has occupied them over the years. At the moment, the street is so uber hip with all the outrageous clothing boutiques instead of all the fabric showrooms I grew up with before the design center opened (The Blue Whale..now with green and red ones added). You must start on one end and just walk the whole way to Melrose...both sides and don't miss Beverly Blvd while you're at it. A great place is the Ivy to spot your favorite celebrities having lunch.",MilkmaidTS

30,Another over rated spot in We-Ho,"Just like Rodeo Drive, you can find various over-priced shops, mediocre restaurants with 10$ drinks and celebrities (let's face it they are mostly reality TV stars)..

30,Must have missed something!,"We went there as this was an iconic street for my teenager daughter. She wanted to see stores where her stars shop. We walked the whole street and while we did see a few high end stores, I don't think it was worth the cab/bus ride. Seeing the cramped people at the iVY was cool (and made me glad we hadn't selected it for a meal), but aside from that, nothing to speak about. Glad I also saw Lisa Vanderpump's restaurant, but again, we didn't go in.The stores were the same as at home; and there was little originality.Maybe it's better at night? We were there just after lunch.",Isa b
30,Not as nice as Rodeo Drive,I heard that this was more of a celebrity hotspot than Rodeo Drive now so we decided to have lunch here instead. Newsroom Cafe was very good but this street was a bit dull. Rodeo is much more picturesque (as a visitor to the city). Next time I would skip this and enjoy a meal on Rodeo instead.,hkennedy

We were a little intimidated when we first arrived trying to get the attention of the staff to ask whether a table was available.You just have to walk right in and ask - this is an incredibly busy restaurant with a large staff and clientele.

50,The New Rodeo Drive...,"I absolutely loved this street. With it's shops by new European Designers, Restaurants like the IVY and its Spas (CaraSoin).I feel this is the up-and-coming place in the West Hollywood-Bev Hills area for shopping and overall hanging out.It was close to our hotel - the Sofitel, but I didn't discover it under the day before we were leaving. I did manage to shop there a couple hours and it was nice to see all the new fashion that you can't get just anywhere. Very original pieces.Rodeo to me paled in comparison. You can get Chanel, Gucci and Hermes anywhere now.I felt like I could have easily spent a couple days wandering around sample the restaurants and shops and spa without getting bored.Enjoy!",betti14
50,Best shopping experience,I come to LA twice a year and Robertson Blvd is always one of my stops. I always update my son's wardrobe when I shop at KItsons Kids and Lisa Klein Kids.These stores have things that Chicago doesn't carry. The cafes and restaurants are all great by Robertson and 3rd.
