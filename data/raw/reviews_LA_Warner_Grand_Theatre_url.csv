50,Vintage Theater For Plays and Music.,"The Warner Grand Theater is an old movie house from the 40's. It is designed with neon on the outside and art deco interior. The theater is going through renovations, but is still open. The City is trying to raise money to bring it back to its original splendor, but that is going to take years. In the mean time, the theater is still beautiful and the sound system is amazing.It is open for plays, musicals and music. You can find them on line and see what is coming up. They are not open everyday so don't just show up. It is located in Old Town San Pedro which is great fun. Many of the stores near there close early so try to get there early if you want to take in all of Old Town.The theater itself is mid size and there are no bad seats. The bathrooms are small and located downstairs (there is ADA on the first floor) which is in the middle of being painted.The ceiling of the inside of the theater is beautiful as is the stage. The plays there are often local production houses and they are reasonably priced and the performances are great. We have seen 3 plays there now, the latest The Sound Of Music. The theater is kid friendly. You can dress causal if you like. I would avoid shorts, but I have seen some men in them and they look out of place.The service at the Warner Grand is the best. You will love this place. Have fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
