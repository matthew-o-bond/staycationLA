50,Once in a Life Time Experience!!,"Hard to believe that we just stumbled on the Endeavor Museum. Since it hasn't been in LA long, I suppose that is why there's not much literature on visiting the Endeavor. We stumbled upon it in riding by Southern Cal. It was well worth our time, and something we'll be glad we saw forever. Makes you realize how brave the men and women are who go up in space, and makes you have a renewed spirit of patriotism. We went at a good time of day, and got in right away, but understand that many times there is a wait. Would have stay much longer if our backs didn't hurt from standing on concrete so long, but was worth the hurting backs. Should be a wonderful experience for children too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnneC31
