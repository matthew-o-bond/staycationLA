50,Excellent local wine maker.,Pulchella has a fun little tasting room on Main street in Santa Clarita and a winery in the industrial area over near Ave Scott. The wine club is free to join and provides for free tastings with the purchase of 4 - 6 bottles of wine semi-annually with the new releases.There are also other membership perks but your should go and check it out for yourself.,Gordoninsantaclarita
50,Like being at Home!!!,After raising my family in Santa Clarita for 25 years and now living out of state I so look forward to making this tastin room a MUST when Iâ€™m visiting. The Wine is excellent but the people are what makes this quaint spot a to GO every time!!!!,Joeysmom
50,Perfect Wine Bar! Great people!,Wonderful ambiance and people in this wine bar. Nice decor and music. A team that really knows its wines. The tastings are educational and give a sample of some very nice wines. I love their red blends. The wines are very good but the welcoming feel and staff are even more enjoyable.,KimbaDDS
50,Suburb wine in unlikely spot.,"Pulchella excels in red wine! Some of the best wine I have ever tasted. And I have tasted a lot. The servers are extremely knowledgeable about the different blends of grapes and will answer all the questions you might have. This place is just a tasting room. If you would like to bring your own food or order take out and eat it there, they're fine with that. We always bring out of town guests here for glass of wine. Everyone is usually surprised that Newhall has a first class tasting room. We were so impressed with their wine that we joined their wine club.",Cthymrtn
50,"Not just ""good for Newhall,"" Good. Period.","I've tasted wine in France, Germany, Napa/Sonoma, Santa Barbara and Paso Robles. Pulchella Winery can hold its own alongside any winery, anywhere. Their wines are solid, and although not every varietal is a home run, taken as a line-up, they are among the best I've had.Being a neighborhood tasting room, far from wine country, Pulchella has gone out of its way to create a welcoming, warm environment for both wine-lovers and people who just want a cozy place to hang out. Your pourer may be one of the assistant winemakers, or even one of owners. If you want to taste a flight and be educated, you can get that. If you just want to hang out and enjoy a glass, that's OK too.You won't find a stuffy, pretentious tasting room, but neither will you find a ""party room"" where the wine itself is not respected. Pulchella walks the fine line between respecting the grape and creating a fun space for its clientele.The wine club is one of the best I've encountered. You get to pick the wines for your allocation, and you get free flight tastings and a pickup party that is second to none. AND, you get a solid discount on any bottles or glasses you buy in the tasting room.I've been a wine club member for several years, and a customer almost since they opened. I feel fortunate indeed to have this establishment in my back yard, and the only thing that would make it better would be to have it surrounded by a couple of hundred acres of vineyard.Hot tip: Order dinner to go from The Newhall Refinery across the street, and Pulchella will let you eat at your table.",David G
50,Friday night wine tasting,Great wines and friendly enthusiastic servers with a wine making background! Will definitely return soon and was able to order dinner from across the street!,Weesa143
50,Great place to taste wine and spend time with friends,We are members of the Pulchella Wine Club and enjoy going from time to time to taste what is new. But even just to have a glass of wine with friends before dinner or a play in downtown Newhall is fun. There are more and more great restaurants in the area.,Patty S
50,The Pulchella Winery tasting room in Newhall is terrific!,"The place to go in Old Town Newhall to taste exceptionally good red wine! Just google first, to check the hours of operation.",vinojeff
40,A commendable winery in an unlikely location,"This is a great winery that has really created some exciting and interesting reds, and even a few great whites. My wife and I have joined the wine club (highly recommended) and now can get free tastings anytime we're in the area (like when we're waiting for a table at the Newhall Refinery!) Rumor has it that you can even have your food from the Refinery delivered there to eat... I haven't tried this yet, but surely will soon.The best part is that this wine is actually crushed and mixed here in the Santa Clarita valley, and is really quite good. Go and indulge, you wont regret it, and you'll be supporting a new and upcoming heavy dose of culture that is much needed in our valley. ENJOY!!",Kaisertod
40,Wine tasting in Valencia,"Surprised to find a tasting room in downtown Newhall. Very cool place to visit, owners are personable and happy to share their knowledge of wines and wine making. Nice to talk to the person who actually makes the wine you are drinking. Wines are good but a bit pricey.",Mike M
50,Nice Find in Santa Clarita!,"You those places you drive by and always mean to visit but just haven't....yet? We experienced that with Pulchella Winery in Santa Clarita. First off, it's not really the winery but the tasting room. They get their grapes from all over Paso Robles, bring them to Santa Clarita and create some amazing wines. We finally visited the other night, and got a chance to meet with one of the owners who is also the winemaker as well as the bartender. You get the idea-it's all about personal care and service. They make an incredible selection of red wines, and we delighted in learning about each, and how they were made. You may purchase a bottle & drink it there, or try sampling their wines! Tasting fees are a modest $10 for a flight of 5 wines (waived if you buy some bottles)..and we soon launched into additional tastings... Long story short, we're fans, and now wine club members as well! You may bring in your own snacks to go with you wine as well. Our only regret is simply not getting there sooner! They are open thurs-fri-sat only!",Stephen S
