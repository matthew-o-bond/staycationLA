30,Crowded but otherwise good,"The parking lot can get really jammed due traffic in area. The store are no different you can find elsewhere, too. Beyond traffic no negative comments, all in all a regular marketplace.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeachStone2C
40,Groceries,"Okay I'll admit this shopping center gets too crowded. The parking lot can get pretty jammed up, but it's only because there are so many great stops here.You can get whatever you need. I tend to go for the Ralphs, but they have some solid lunch options like Mendocino Farms and Fresh Bros.
