50,The BLVD,"What a nice way to spend an evening or afternoon. Take the kids, plenty of shops for food and memorabilia. Shady spots to beat the heat and plenty of history about this little city. Great for dinner or lunch or just about any time of day. Special event's close the streets so more folks can enjoy the area.",Mark W
50,Great Town,The BLVD is a great place and on a Friday or Saturday you can go to bar after bar with each one being unique as well as a lot of fun.,Estate Seller

50,Lunch at the Modern Tea Room on the Blvd,"Had lunch at the Modern Tea Room for the first time. The menu included sandwich’s, soups, vegan food selection and of course their special teas. The sandwich was good and the hot tea was great and prices were reasonable. So if you the time and want to try something a little different try the Modern Tea Room and think you will enjoy it.",nongmeejohn
50,"Movie, Dinner and Hanging Out!",Checked out a great movie at the Regency and walked around the BLVD to find a good spot to relax and have a drink and some food. We decided on going the Lucky Luke Brewing Pub ....Was not disappointed!It's nice to have somewhere local to chill and have a pleasant evening enjoying my family and friends.,awhyms

30,Nice early evening walk,"Spent early evening walking The Blvd. good friendly place to watch people, check out shops, have a sip of wine, have a bite of American, Mexican and Brazilian foods. Wonderful atmosphere. Good street music. Good food. Good friends. Who could ask for more. When in town, don’t miss out checking this place out.",ofeliap626
40,"Drinks, Dining and Shopping","The Blvd always has events during special holidays and other attractions. It is a great place for dining, having a beer, wine or cocktail. It has some nice specialty boutique style shops for that unique gift for someone special.",Wander759007
50,City of Lancaster Block party,It was pretty cool they had a free concert event the plain white tees performed it was probably the coolest thing that Lancaster did my whole life living here it was free and awesome the whole family went but it was freezing,denisechristine91
40,An all-American small town main street,"Went to the boulevard for the weekly Thursday evening farmer's market which was quite disapointing. But, I very much enjoyed the stroll past little boutique shops and eateries that line the sidewalk. Also found a small museum of art and history which is unfortunately closed right now in preparation for the opening of a new exhibition.",bfindysz
50,"Small, but pleasant to walk along and find a restaurant or bar","And you might even run into a car show, live music, etc.It's low key, but a civic center is in the middle of the area, so you might catch a show or performance. Also see the Museum of Art and History: MOAH.",Whatiguana
50,Fun Place to Hang Out,"The Blvd is a family and friend place. Plenty of shops and paces to eat. Sit out on the sidewalk and watch the foot traffic, or hit up the Blvd on Thursdays after 4pm to buy fresh produce and goodies. There is always something going on during the weekends- just talk a stroll and find out :)",925darleent
30,"Nice try, Lancaster","The Blvd was a decent attempt at a nice place to hang out in Lancaster. The problem is, it's still in Lancaster. There are a few cool shops and restaurants to visit here. My wife and I used to go to Kinetic Brewing on a weekly basis for dinner or a few drinks - good beer and food. One of our favorite restaurants was Giannini's but they closed their doors a few months ago (not sure why). Port de Vino is a great place to go for wine and a relaxed atmosphere. We just got sick and tired of all the degenerates loitering around the area, and the morons driving up and down the blvd, bumping their crap music with their blown out speakers, hoping someone would give them the time of day. There are too many low lives living in the surrounding apartments that ruin the atmosphere.",seanfts06
30,Poor parking and good restaurants leave this area.,"The BLVD is overfull of homeless, kids riding skateboard and people looking for a handout. Our city govt. thinks it a ""destination place."" HA! A few of the good restaurants have left and except for an occasional special event on the BLVD, it's not worth the gas tp travel there.",Patricia F
30,Small and Quaint Town Feel,"The Blvd is the center of major social and community activities on every holidays. It is not a tourists place. The locals love it. For the business circle, it is a bit expensive to operate.",Susan B
40,Farmers Market,Every Thursday they have a farmer market on the blvd several vendors and live Music Great place to go in the evening with Family or friends,Andre V
20,Parking Design Fail,"Whatever committee designed the parking on the boulevard should be ashamed of themselves, unless the lead of that committee was a new grad and the city decided to take a chance to save money; then SHAME ON THE CITY OF LANCASTER. First we decided to check out the local mom and pop shops on the boulevard as the city depicts their pride in being non - franchised in this area. Immediate introduction upon entering the boulevard is a sign that advertises coffee from the well known crown wearing mermaid, and a resturante named after a specific belt accessory and type of foot wear. Not sure if I'm allowed to name them in this review but so much for non-franchised businesses and the little guy huh? Next there's an ambulance desperately trying to navigate through the one way street to wherever their call may be guiding them to no avail; hope it's not a true emergency, ugh. Unfortunately there is no place to pull over for the ambulance. Vehicles frozen in fear, can't pull over to the right as it's lined with bumper to bumper cars, most illegally parked in the red or loading zones. No parking to the left because TREES are planted in the poorly designed slanted parking areas. Slant parking design is great, saves space and makes since on a one way street. The trees which I love adds much needed character, shade, and beauty to the otherwise bland looking boulevard. But the trees take up every other parking space LITERALLY. The same trees could have been planted in the center of all parking spaces, not only adding more trees but more parking. The city may argue that the design prevents bottleneck traffic but they have not seen the traffic build up from the drive thorough coffee chain or goodness forbid ambulance try to get through just even to navigate through a side street. The traffic is only going to get worse as some sort if hotel has broken ground next to the coffee chain. How about a parking structure instead of a hotel. Thank goodness for choices because as we were able to drive the length of the boulevard, (24 mins) we kept going and took our money and leisure time to Palmdale. Parking Design Fail.",DeShara B
30,Can be a nice place to stroll ... if the weather is right,"BLVD is beautiful, but not so much practical; the high cost for a business to operate there is passed on in the pricing to the shoppers. I love to stroll through when the Farmer's Market is there, but general shopping is not something I will do. I don't like that a Starbucks is now being put in there - so sad - don't want to see the place with commercialized business, but unfortunately, the small, intimate family-owned places can't afford to operate there. Parking is bad also. And just trying to drive down the BLVD is bad. No way to watch where you're driving while still trying to find a business. Maybe business names can be placed on the sidewalk at the curb",Kathy P
10,over rated Mainly a place for young people to hang out at.,"Not really much there. It is WAY OVER RATED and should not be even thought of as a tourist place. Its just mostly OVER EXPENSIVE shops. Parking is a nightmare as you have to park in the center and then try to back out at a angle into traffic to get out of a parking space, if your lucky enough to find one.Whoever decides what music to play nonstop on the speakers outside along the blvd. needs to vary their taste a lot more. It would be better to have NO MUSIC AT ALL. They seem to forget that not everyone wants to hear nonstop music when trying to have a relaxing outside time.",retiredoldsarge

40,BLVD is highlight of Lancaster,"Downtown business district makeover has created an area worth visiting in Lancaster. The Performing Arts Center is an amazing venue for music and stage productions, including local Cedar Street Theatre shows. The MOAH art museum's rotating exhibits that I've seen have all been interesting and thought-provoking. There are several very good restaurants serving lunch and dinner, a brew-pub, a wine bar and a number of small specialty shops including a new and used bookstore. The BLVD Cinema is apparently closed at present, hope it comes back soon.The Farmer's Market on Thursdays is a good reason to get out and stroll the boulevard, with lots of food stalls, although the produce selection could be wider.The BLVD is a great place for special events like the Halloween and Christmas celebrations (the Halloween event was more fun in past years, this year it ended before sunset) and the Streets of Lancaster go-kart races.",Ed_from_LA_County
50,I love the Blvd.!,"There's always things going on there, from farmers markets, car shows and races, to winter celebrations, very fun and lively. Lots of places to choose to eat, the Kinetic Brewery and the theaters. I like the way it's all been redone, except the parking down the middle, they could have designed that better for more parking.",gerryclaud
40,Very Nice if you are in Lancaster for some reason.,"The BLVD is quite nice if you are in Lancaster. There is not a lot to do there, so if you have time go to the BLVD.There are cute shops, places to eat and they usually have something going on, maybe a Farmer's Market, or a live band. It is quite safe and great for a walk in the evening when the heat has died down to a nice breeze.The area is renovated and a really nice walk. Have a great time. The locals are very friendly and will direct you to some nice eateries and candy shops. The BLVD also has a couple of nice antique shops.",elizabethlascheid

Antique stores to find that special something. Farmers market with the best fruit and veggie's. Love it. At night they have bands outdoors. But don't forget if you just want a treat the candy shop, coffee and ice cream. For those who love museums there is one. Very nice lots to se and do for a day or night out. Check if it's the small race car time of year. They block off some roads but you can find parking.Christmas is very nice. Do check on the happenings. Before you plan your trip.",Lora C

Great food great shop's,richsorg
40,I go to the Boulevard frequently.,"I ate there yesterday at 1800 Simply the Best Burritos and Tacos. The name is quite accurate. It is family owned, they never use lard and they never freeze anything. Food is made to order and it doesn't take that long. The food is very tasty and I am not really fond of most Mexican food but Jose and his family do a great job. There are many fine places on this walking journey of about a mile. They do need parking for handicapped on the Boulevard though.",Sue S

40,Dinner and Concert on the BLVD,"I like the BLVD because it concentrates an outing's worth of things to eat/drink, do/see into one location, without requiring a visit to the mall. Our group started the evening at BEX for dinner and a glass of wine, then dropped into Double D's for fresh made mini cupcakes, followed by the Beatles Vs Stones show. The city of Lancaster schedules many events on the BLVD, which are family friendly and safe. The BLVD has restaurants, a pub, wine bar, hair styling, theatre, Thursday Farmer's Market, and more. If you visit the Antelope Valley, it is definitely worth a peek.",Martiro7

40,What a change,I grew up in Lancaster so I was astonished at the change in the downtown area. The BLVD seems to be quite a happening place with a good many bars and restaurants interspersed with local business. I would definitely not park on the BLVD but would find parking on a side street or in a public lot because it seemed that getting out of your space on a weekend night could be a nightmare. It is definitely a must see.,karonc752
20,Too much traffic,WE were here when they shut the street down for the pro go cart races. Really makes it hard to get a parking spot or get into the restaurants. Really wish they would not do it. This is the second year in a row that this has happened as it is my sons birthday weekend.,BCRON

I met a local who was on his way to the Post Office.In this area of the Blvd there is also the Lancaster Visitor Office. Given Lancaster's importance in aerospace, it was nice to see the Aerospace Walk of Fame on the Blvd. There are also lots of very nice murals honoring the military.There is a monument that honors the Tuskegee airmen.On the Blvd, there is also the Lancaster Library, which is a nice. There is also the fire station.It is great that one can then walk the Blvd to shops and cafes. It has a local charm about it.There are also museums, American Heritage Park, cinema, and more.They have a harvest festival in October. This is also the area where they have the farmer's market.We very much liked the Blvd, its patriotism and local flavor, and the many things to do. We will need to come here again and explore further when we are in Lancaster.Its a very nice Main Street for Lancaster and well worth time to explore.

However, there are so many thugs and homeless that I do not feel safe taking my family. I don't want to eat dinner next to thug teenagers and people sleeping on benches.

30,Not Good For Parades,"Putting parking down the middle of the street with trees around is a good idea for a shopping and eating street but not so good for parades. Lancaster Blvd was known for it's Fair and Christmas parades, with lots of room for AV's many high school marching bands to walk and play. It was fun to watch them and hear them play, everybody came. Now, with half the street blocked off and the trees in the middle, bands can no longer march down the street and play. They try, but in half the space they're walking up on the sidewalks and kids are grabbing at their instruments. They can't even be judged on the Blvd, they all go down West of 10th St. where Lancaster Blvd. is four lanes. I think this is where the parades should be held. There's plenty of room so there could be floats again and maybe more variety of entries. Especially at Christmas. As an event place The Blvd works well, but business don't stay for long. It's not a place people just come to shop. It has some good restaurants and a micro brewery. There's live bands that play outside the restaurant Bex occasionally, and a bar and a mini bowling alley. There's a Farmers Market once a week. You have to call to find out about getting tickets for the theater. Stores are expensive, no place to get a bargain. There's a Post Office, a Library and a police station but they don't patrol The Blvd. There's homeless people around. Like anywhere, keep your eyes open and be cautious. It's a lot of fun at Halloween but it's celebrated early and over to soon. A lot of kids miss the trick or treat part. Lots of people dress up and it's fun to see the costumes walking up and down the street.",Where2nowCa

40,"Great Hotel, Good Location. Smells like Lavender","Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and I was very pleased. It's located right off the freeway and is really close to Universal Studios. Parking is a different, you have to leave your key at the lobby in case they need to move your car. They have happy hour, which we unfortunately didn't get to enjoy since we were out and about around that time. If you're sensitive to smell, the hallways may bother you. The smell however was pleasant to me, but bothered my a husband a little. There is a spa on the second floor it is to be expected. The staff for the most part were nice and there's lemonade at the lobby. It was a decent stay and may consider staying here again.",Maria N
40,Fun Place to Go During Special Events,"The BLVD is having a series of special events most of the time and I enjoy the Farmers Market on Thursday afternoons as well as the derby races during the annual races. There are a lot of shops to look at (I don't always find things) and restaurants to choose from depending on the food you are in the mood to eat. I like the beer and fish and chips at Kinetics and then the trip tip salad at Bexx. If you have a big appetite and a little extra money to spare, you should try the Rio Brazilian Grill. Plus, the Blvd honors our heroes with banners of military members past and present. My own Marine has a banner outside of the Rio Brazilian restaurant! He was told about it when he was deployed to Iraq and was so honored to have it go up!",EllieRKay

50,"Blvd Cinemas Cafe (Groundwork), Battlegrounds, Behold3D.Me","If you aren't coming to the BLVD, you're missing out on a lot. They have really good breakfast, lunch and dinner restaurants. I'd say their quality is well above average in terms of quality and value in California. They have bars too and they were all crowded when I went last weekend.However among my favorites are BLVD Cinemas Cafe (Groundwork), Battlegrounds, and Behold3D.Me.The cafe's coffee is just excellent, and moreover this guy Chris gave us all the local travel tips we needed to enjoy what we came for. Definitely coming back for coffee and the conversationBattlegrounds. If you have inner nerd in you, be sure to check out this place. They have Magic card competition there. It really was a pleasant surprise for me and they let my g/f and I watch and take photos together haha.Behold3D.Me. You want action figures of yourself printed through 3D printer? Check it out. Really cool stuff there that they actually print.What I also noticed is that the people I've met in Lancaster are not just friendly, but are charming. It's not the intense/fake kind of friendly you see in Los Angeles or elsewhere in general. They just are, and you can tell. Koodos to you people of Lancaster!",sonicchill

Thursdays, during the summer, The Blvd has a farmers market where you can find fresh, locally grown produce. At Halloween time, The BLVD transforms into The BOOlvd, where you can go trick or treating, enjoy many activities for the family and even find great food and treasure.

Don't get me wrong, this is no Sunset Blvd but for this particular city, this is the best thing going if you've been stuck in this bloody desert for too many years. The Blvd has a movie theatre, museums, numerous restaurants, kinetic brewery, post office, library, a dog park off the Blvd, hair salons, barber shops, a dreadlock shop off the Blvd (oh my- awesome!!!), gas station, gym, dance studios, city council, city hall, sheriffs station, fire department, artist lofts, weekly farmers markets, performing arts theatre, boutiques, consignment shops, to name some and not to mention the live street band during summer, the street parties and holiday parades, The Grand Prix, the bums, yeah the bums, wow this one mile stretch is not bad at all!",eslala
50,"Great food, drinks and entertainment!",The BLVD is a secret gem off the beaten path. Clearly the cultural hub for the Antelope Valley with three museums and a world class performing arts center. The food choices are great and shopping spots are unique from antiques and vintage to new hip retail. Weekly Thursday Farmers Market is a good source for real locally grown produce and fun family entertainment. Definitely try the award winning hand crafted brews at Kinetic and a healthy lunch at Lemon Leaf. I frequent both.,ACprojects
30,We live 80 feet from The BLVD and love it!,"The Library, Sheriff's dept, post office, MOAB musium, Barbers and beauticians, shops of all kinds, bakeries, delis, bars and restaurants aplenty make The BLVD a real delight. Plenty of easy and free parking and a cultural center bringing top acts to the desert brings it all to life. Add to all of this a cinema you can bring wine into then lounge on recliner sofas as you watch the latest flixs make The BLVD a great place to live. WE love it.",Commercialtourist
20,This is it? Really?,"I understand that the recent recession hit business owners and stagnated the development of the proposed Boulevard project However, it saddens me that for those businesses that are struggling to remain open, the local residents fail to support for many reasons. When interviewing residents, parking was a concern as was the fact that most days and nights, over 50% of the storefronts are closed. Other than the cafes and restaurants who advertise highly overpriced menu items, most families have chosen to travel to Palmdale for shopping and entertainment. This is not the fault of the business owners struggling to remain open, but from the struggle to recover from the recent recession. High prices will hopefully decrease as the foot traffic begins to see economic movement in a positive direction. However, until then, there is little to be desired for tourists and locals will continue to budget their entertainment dollars accordingly.",RLDrPH

30,Be there early,Nice place to walk around. But all the ships and restaurants close early. You would think they would stay open since this would be a great place for everyone to flock to. Went one night Around 9pm on a Friday... And everything was closed.Bex is probably the only place that stays open,love2travel513
40,A Little Bit Like an Oasis in a Desert of a Town,"The BLVD surprised us on our recent visit to Lancaster. It's such a stark difference from the rest of the city with it's carefully manicured landscaping, cool shops and restaurants, ample parking, fun things to see and do and more. We walked up and down the length of the BLVD about six or seven times while we were in town and checked out many of the shops and had some good food and drinks. The BLVD Cinemas space, specifically, was really cool along with Kinetic, Pour D'Vino and more. The people watching on the BLVD was stellar and, overall, it was a very fun experience.",dknight818
40,Good restaurants,"There are a few restaurants I like here, just remember that there is parking out back. Olives is good for Mediterrean food and at Lemon Leaf I could find my brown rice pasta. But order the gleuten-free dessert early because it might be gone.",nanci n
30,Descent Place to Walk Around in Lancaster,"The BLVD came along a way in the last few years, with lack of attractions around Lancaster, it comes in as a descent place for food and a couple of antique shops.the farmers market every Thursday, adds a nice flare to it, with seasonal events during Halloween and Christmas too.",AMr0ue
40,BLVD. PRIDE,"Being a resident of Lancaster Ca. for 28 years I have watched our city grow and change. The rebirth of our BLVD. from the new and old businesses. For the first time in years our BLVD has given me a sense of pride. The city has provided the residents with special events 4 months out of the year, to farmers market every Thursday. Summer concerts. The BLVD provides year around entertainment, shopping and dining. Our BLVD offers something for everyone, a place we can be proud to call our very own.",Dianne and Cesar

50,My favorite place to think,"I am so happy Lancaster, CA has made some amazing improvements to the city. The BLVD previously known as Downtown Lancaster, has transformed into a tourist destination. There is a lot to do on the BLVD, with the farmers market on Thursdays, this place is the ideal location for those individuals with a lot on their mind, grab a coffee from the Band Stand and enjoy a walk on the new Lancaster BLVD.",Max A
50,Great Outdoor Space in Lancaster,"This area gets five stars just for the idea of it. Downtown Lancaster was kinda funky/cool back in the 1950s and 1960s when this area first started to grow. But like most any downtown core, it eventually fell into decline as suburbia had its heydays. But now everything that is old is new again, and the city fathers and merchants have lovingly tried to breathe new life into this old haunt. Everybody thinks it could use more shops, and I suppose they would get them if more people would support the area with their shopping dollars. But there are many one-of-a-kind, eclectic shops and eateries here that make this area unique and special - not just another ""lifestyle village"" filled with chain stores. Great retro vibe, pedestrian-friendly. Lots of trees and flowers that make it a cool (literally) place to hang out in Lancaster's typically hot days and nights. Bars, theaters, and special events make this an important destination. Thursdays there is a popular farmers market.",jg3arrow
40,Great Idea but needs more Shops,The redo of the Blvd. was a great Idea but it definitely needs more shops. It also needs more to be open on Sundays. It would be a great place to walk around after church.,Khattykathy

50,Great urban downtown renovation,The folks in Lancaster have done an excellent job of renovating and revitalizing their downtown strip. Many superb shops and restaurants to visit.

40,Feels Like Your in a Small Town,My experiences on The BLVD have been extremely pleasant. The streets and sidewalks are not cluttered with crowds. I feel so comfortable when I visit my favorite hair salon Panache. Which is one of the many community oriented businesses you'll come across when shopping on The Blvd.,murch1
40,Great improvement for City of Lancaster,"When I first moved to the Antelope Valley, Lancaster Blvd (now The BLVD) was a fairly run down street with not much going on. Wow, this development has changed things! Nice selection of independently owned businesses and some great little restaurants to check out. The Farmer's Market on Thursdays is always nice with a selection of produce and other goods; you can eat your way down the street. Lancaster is a small city so this isn't 3rd Street Promenade but it's nice that we have a choice of independent businesses to patronize. Parking in the centre of the street is the only drawback as it is difficult to back out of the parking spaces. Opt instead for one of the parking lots on the side streets where you can park under banks of solar panels; a GREAT option in the hot desert summer.",jerjon
50,Very Cool,The Hotel we stayed at Suggested we try the BLVD we are glad we took their advice. The area was very nice and has quite a few options for dinner to choose from. If you come to Lancaster you have to stop by and check it out.,Kemb247

I love how they renovated the blvd, but I remember seeing how it was before and it saddens me since I've lived here my whole life. The spacing for cars gets annoying sometimes and it's not recommended to drive there if you are new to driving haha. I still love it and I hope to one day play there infamous public piano.",Auroa000

30,Coming Along,"We like going to the BLVD for the restaurants and boutique shops. The need to continue development of nice eateries, etc. The far end is still kind of a ghost town.

40,Like a Phoniex Rising from the ashes,"Having lived in the area for a little over 20 years, I can attest that Lancaster ""BLVD"" has finally begun to reach it true potential.

30,Good place to hang out,"Since they revamped this section of the street, (it's now called ""The Blvd"") this is a nice place to go and eat and hang out. There is (at least last time I was there) a bowling alley under the Bex's restaurant. As Kathleen Madigan joked when she was performing at the Performing Arts Center last year, it's a lovely street..... just don't leave that street!!! Some nice restaurants and shops... and a farmer's market on Thursdays, I believe.... check that. Worth a trip.

My favorite ones are Bex which is short for Be Extraordinary a nice restaurant, a cool beer bar, and downstairs a bowling alley pool tables and an even cooler bar.Nearby is a Mediterranean wine bar, and a small micro brewery beer restaurant. there is also a very cool movie theatre, that shows both independent and foreign films, and is in the same building as a unique boutique/ art gallery.

50,Top Entertainment Place in North LA county,"Lancaster has a long and storied history of being the center of North LA county. This main street in town had declined into nothing special. The gentrification and revitalization is amazing. There are parades, holiday celebrations, farmers markets, etc. It truly is bringing this community back together. People are coming from all over SoCal to check it out. The future of this is bright, and is well-deserving of it. The best part of it, is the history of this street. The street itself was laid out in the 1870s, and there are buildings from all the subsequent decades, giving us a look into the rich history of Lancaster. It is definitely worth going to. It is not only for tourists, but also locals as well.",christian f

By the time we were finished the sun was setting and as we traveled to our car we came across the Cedar Center for Performing arts and they were having an open mic night.Never have we seen such an eclectic mix of artists in one venue. The performers were from good to great and the genres were many, from ukuleles to stand up basses, to accapella. From country and bluegrass to indie-folk and rock. There were poetry performances as well as comedy... I gotta say I'm glad I got it all on video it was an amazing event in an amazing place.",Hordor
40,A Good Start,"The Antelope Valley has been waiting for this kind of hip, downtown place for a long time! I love what they have done so far, and I am a huge fan of Bandstand coffee and the Farmer's Market they have every Thursday.

40,Feels like a real downtown in a real city,This stretch of Lancaster has tons of history if you want to do the research. What the city and developers have done there is outstanding! The area went from a sad aged street to a bustling destination for citizens. My tax dollars now have a place to show and tell for others. The only thing lacking from the area is quality lodging and a few more higher end restaurants and bars. I hope the area keep thriving!,Hellsumz
20,Holding it together!,Times are hard and it shows downtown. Very little activity and service is so-so. Seems like people just stay home more these days. One nice little coffee/internet shop was busy and looked like a good place to relax and meet people..,chucky22
50,Was glad we got to visit it,Everyone was friend. Sorry a lot of the shops were closed in the morning we were walking around,Hugs164
40,A Lovely Metropolitan Stroll,"If you look at downtown Lancaster, CA on Lancaster Blvd between 10th St W and Sierra Hwy, zoom in close using Google Earth or Google Maps (as of Feb 2012 don't use streetview - its 5-yr-old pictures are pre-refurbishment).You will see half-a-mile of newly refurbished tree lined pedestrian boulevard with nice, angled center-street parking, shade trees along the parking strip, and lots of restaurants, shops, art galleries, theaters, a beautiful public library, and more. My family has gone there for an every-candy-you-can-imagine candy shoppe, awesome chinese, peruvian, and thai restaurants, movie watching experiences in an intimate theater with reclining sofa seats, cosmic bowling, civic events, local theater, high school dances, and just to take a nice walk. Something for everyone.Admittedly, it is small compared to similar disctricts in larger cities, and could use some better lodging choices, but it is a wonderful place to enjoy a cool evening stroll and meet the more cosmopolitan residents of the Antelope Valley.",Michael P
