50,Out with Co Workers,"Absolutely best Sushi I have had! Great atmosphere, music and drinks. I can not wait to get back to California for sushi!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NWTraveler1968
50,Piscean dream bar,"Located at the basement of a building, murals of sea life while descending the stairs a perfect photo op. Doorman volunteered to take photos upon entering. Overhead an aquarium full of fishes starts at the bottom of the stairs all the way at the other end of the room. We sat at the bar and ordered the drink Otonano Amasa served in a bird shape glass with toasted marshmallows at the rear. This drink ,which name means Sweetness in adults, is delish another round is a must. The Farmers Market Tempura remains crunchy even after it cooled off. The sauce was to die for. My friend has the California 11 and Pork Gyoza. I taste the Gyoza it found it pretty good. But that marshmallows I just need to have another that I ask for another piece and was given several. It's chewy with a filling inside. Bar tender kept us entertained with friendly, funny banter. Our waitress even ask if we want our pictures taken and made suggestions for a good backdrop. I would suggest reservations at least a week in advance. Parking is expensive around the resto but you can park at a structure next to Biltmore Hotel for $6.50 till 10:30pm. Limited street parking free on Saturdays and Sundays at 515 S Olive St. which is a 2 -3 min walk. You can see the building where the restaurant is located from this spot. I thoroughly enjoyed the food, drink, ambience, staff and service of this venue. I highly recommend and would definitely be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maria2628
50,Wonderful special birthday dinner!!!,The ambiance; the food; the music; the Japanese art...all incredible! I'm ready to go back. Wish I lived closer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grniiz28
50,Unexpected underwater experience!,"We had a corporate meeting here, so the place was no my choice. Nice surprise it was when we went down the stairs and found ourselves under a huge aquarium with ocean fishes! See pictures. The guys serve all types of seafood in combination with pasta, vegetables, etc. Sushi / sashimi are also on the menu. They go well with Japanese matcha IPA, which is of dark green colour! Various cocktails are offered. Service is excellent! The boss Alex was personally all around us to make sure we were happy. This place is relatively new and works in the basement and they also have a venue on the roof named Perch. I‚Äôve heard that is very famous and queue to enter is impressive on week-ends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anatolyk201
50,Best Sushi in LA,"What a place , WowThis restaurant is a master piece by all meansAnd most important its the real thingFood taste great which is the thing we looking at when we eat but it is served , look at smells superWent with my nephew through warm recommendation of a good friend and it wasOne of the better ones I had in my trip to California , believe it or not but the huge aquarium tank hanged there above your head in the restaurant ceiling has a real shark in itüëäüèªThe hot saki we were recommended by the host also was a good starter , take that and the baracuda fish its almost taste like beef üôÄI am also told in weekends they have band playing there but we were mid week early night so we missed that",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielBazel
40,"Good food, interesting space","Excellent ramen and sea bass appetizers, very good sushi (uni and toro). Service was a solid B and the mixed drinks likewise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrewMacN
50,"Delicious food, beautiful place","Amazing restaurant , starting from the design (and a huge aquarium tank with fish that runs across the room), and the food we ordered- every bite of it tasted like a heaven! Will be back !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OlyasDream
40,Beautiful Upscale Cuisine,"Quite impressed with the beautiful theme of Mrs. Fish. Well thought out restaurant / bar, with a great selection of booze. Small menu offerings though. Plates are presented well, dishes I would rate 7/10 for taste. Prices surprisingly cheap considering the upscale ambience.Our friendly waiter was almost non-existent, dishes were served by 4 other service personnel. I would recommend hanging at the bar, rather than the food. I've probably eaten at +100 sushi restaurants in 25 countries. Would not go back for the food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RickyChili
50,Trendy,"Trendy place, lots of good vibes, original menu, friendly staff, great seafood ans other unique plates. One of the nicest aquarium I have seen",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/578Yves
40,Nice Underground Sushi Resturant/Below the Perch,Great food for both folks who like sushi as well as other dinner eats. Great atmosphere with the large fish tank suspended over many of the dinner tables. They also have a great DJ the plays today's hip hop music as well as a mix of 70s & 80s R&B hits. Drinks are good as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcM1937
40,One of the most beautiful spaces in downtown LA and the food is tasty too,"As you descend the tunnel like staircase and enter this space the large and beautiful room comes into view. The place is filled with beautiful lighting, tons of color and a huge fish tank overhead. The sushi is really great. The drinks are also quite tasty. The service was also spot on. This is definitely a place you should try for dinner and if you dine late enough stay for the club music,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackV846
50,"A little sushi, a little beef, a little delicious!","Came here because this place has something for everyone... Starting with cocktails! My Kiyomi was great, the blend of Whisky and Sake was well balanced and the lemongrass and lemon added to the yumminess. BF had a Matane (two whiskeys, plum wine and Cinzano Rosso) which he really liked and sister had a ""no hangover"" Zen Garden that was a tasty blend of botanicals, cucumber, lime and honey. We are so happy we splurged on the Golden Yuzu sushi, fresh and flavorful and beautifully presented. BF and I ordered the beef short ribs - absolutely delicious. The short ribs were melt-in-your mouth and we both were scraping our plates to get every last bit of the creamy sunchoke puree. Sister stayed with the sushi theme and had Albacore Warayaki (hay-smoked albacore, shiso and citrus soy) for her main dish. She loved it.We liked the decor. Loved the enormous fish tank suspended from the ceiling and all the art on the walls. Had a super-friendly server, Conrad, that made our night out lots of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/offonanadventure
40,Almost a perfect 5,"We had a great meal and the food was quite excellent! Well prepared and served with great eye appeal. Ah, but the server was a bit pretentious and not very helpful in making selections. Perhaps she was not as knowledgeable as she should have been or perhaps I was not bright enough to understand her. However, the food was excellent and I would go back! The decor was terrific and the interior designer deserves a lot of credit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oldergent
50,Incredible ambiance and equally great food,"What a cool experience and thankful to the business colleagues who invited along to a client dinner here. You descend down a classic staircase into an underground 'lair' that reminded us of an Austin Power film. But in a very very good way. The place has been completely renovated with a cool retro vibe that is completely different than most of the photos that you see on the site.You're greeted by a massive fish tank as you come into the restaurant. The service is extremely friendly and attentive. They offer honest advice and opinions about the dishes and the drinks based on your preferences. I can honestly say we did no ordering, we let our host and the restaurant staff choose the dishes that kept coming out. Everything was amazing and along with the sushi I will point out a short rib dish that sat on a bed of mashed potatoes or cauliflower to be an incredible standout.Great spot for a date, friends or business clients.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/biscardicreative
50,Awesome food + art = Great Night Out!,"Mrs. Fish is a great place to view fabulous Japanese modern art...and the food and service are just as impressive. Mrs. Fish is a new downtown restaurant that opened a few weeks ago. From street level you immediately descend, under the ‚Äúsea,‚Äù into a multi-level subterranean den that evokes both the 30s glamour of old Los Angeles and the hip, modern vibe of now. Apparently the owners love Japan and brought all their favorite artwork into the space, which is impressive and unique. Want to know more about a specific piece? Just ask! The service is joltingly outstanding, given LA standards. No pretentiousness or blas√© attitudes here. Everyone was welcoming, attentive, and gracious. Let‚Äôs hope it stays that way as time goes on!Mrs Fish is both loungey and restauranty. Perfect for drinks and small bites after work, or a lazy sit down dinner. Once we were seated on the upper level, overlooking the room, taking in the great soundtrack, we ordered a bottle of sake, edamame, and the albacore with yuzu soy vinaigrette appetizer. All were very tasty. Then we shared a variety of a la carte nigiri sushi, including maguro, toro, ama-ebi, kampachi, and hamachi. Very delicious! Next we ordered the kurobuta pork belly yakitori and the braised short rib‚Äîboth were outstanding! The short rib was an entree portion, quite large for two people, and cooked to perfection with root vegetables and a potato pur√©e. We finished by sharing a chocolate mousse-like cake with matcha ice cream. Very delectable, and quite a generous portion. We ended up taking the rest of the short rib and half the cake home.Overall Mrs Fish gets an A for us‚Äîexcellent food, outstanding service, fabulous room, and the perfect vibe. We wish them a lot of success!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tmklee23
30,ambiance is great but the food was average,"When you first walk in the restaurant you will appreciate the atmosphere. We had dinner here after the remodeling, so to be fair the waiter seemed to take a long time to get our drinks and at one point we started to order two drinks at a time. The food was just ok nothing that would make me come back if it was only based on food alone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/808sanjeetl
50,Worth a visit,"Lovely restaurant and very friendly staff. The food was very tasty although nothing in particular stood out. The staff are very friendly and the service was excellent. The venue itself is an interesting space, divided up in to smaller areas of sit down dining and different cozy bars. We sat up on the balcony with a view of the entire restaurant, eye level with a suspended aquarium! Upon entering you walk down a majestic staircase that feels like you have been transported back in time. Well worth a visit if you are in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AskEileen
30,Slow service,"My friend and I walked into Mrs. Fish on a Friday night. The hostess asked if we were there for dinner and I stated I didn't have reservations but we were hungry. She was able to seat us right away. Our service came right away and served our water and took our order. They delivered my friend's cod within 15 minutes but my steak did not arrive until 20 minutes after my friend received her food. I believe restaurant food should be served at relatively the same time for everyone in the party. To make matters worse, the server, Chris, seemed to avoid our table for the next hour. He would serve one table and walk away quickly. After 45 minutes of waiting and talking I had to flag him down when he was at a faraway table and motioned I wanted the check. He nodded but then went to another table of 4 to take their order. He finally dropped off the check and I slipped the payment in there. I again had to wait for him to come pick it up while he served everyone else. After 15 minutes (so now a total of 1 hour after we were done eating) I walked up to the bar where he was at and personally handed him the payment. He returned with the receipt to sign a couple minutes later and apologized for the delay stating he had to deal with a difficult customer. Having watching him for an hour while waiting to pay so we could leave, I know the customer he was talking about had arrived about 20 minutes before that conversation so that difficult customer had nothing to do with our hour wait to pay and leave.Other than that annoying experience, Mrs. Fish is a beautiful place, the food is good and the prices are fair.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TR1721
50,Go Fish,"We were upstairs at Perch and on our way out while talking to the elevator guy, he mentioned that if we were interested in sushi, we should just try Mrs. Fish right outside the Perch building. He said it's pretty cheap but delicious. I was not sure because what is good in LA and cheap. However, we ended up going and it did not disappoint. We were there early, seated right away, and the environment is very lounge-like with overhead aquariums. We didn't stay for the live music conversion that apparently happens in the later hours, but I would definitely go back to check it out. Service was quick, kind, and the sushi was simple, yet delicious. And the bill was even better. I highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michishellie
50,Just made my best list,So I thought it was just a bar...so far from it....live jazz and funk music echo through the small but well decorated joint. The ambient lighting reflect through fishtanks and onto plush couches where 20 somethings and middle aged Angelenos mingle and lounge while indulging on gourmet level appetizers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travettep
30,all hype.,this is a really big space. went on a friday night. had 2 drinks and beef sliders and my bill was over $50. very overpriced.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dorkiemiche
50,Great downtown lounge with live music,"LOVE this place: Great ambience, drinks, venues and service! I highly recommend this place for happy hours, get together for any occasion, date, and just hanging out and enjoying the music. Music is not too loud so that's why I recommend this place: you can maintain a decent convo here without yelling or you can just boogie for a bit.After going down the stairs from the door, there's a large fish tank with lots of cool fish in the tank- even baby sharks! There's a main bar in front of the lounge area and then there's another bar in the lower lounge area. There is a top level but no bar up there, just looks like bottle and cocktail service. There are some tables to lounge at near the main bar but looks like you have to reserve. There are nice lounges in the lower and upper floors- perfect for a gathering of friends.Drinks: they are nice strong and classic drinks. Didn't see all the fancy drinks that other bars have- which is fine with me. Lay it on strong and full and no complaints from me.Food: I ordered the potato chips once and they came with a nice dipping sauce. Salty goodness it was with the drinks. Haven't gotten a chance to try the other appetizers.On any given night, every show that I've seen here has been great live local talent. No cover either. Usually small line (unlike Perch so don't let that line confuse you).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelinh1
40,Live music!,"I really like place a lot.You walk down the stairs and the first thing you see is a beautiful aquarium. There are three different levels, the top, middle and bottom. I love how there is no hassle at the front door and cover is free! There is plenty of space to sit and no hassle about it either. Drinks were a bit on the pricey side, but a place I'd love to come to again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kisssmee
30,Not so great for walk ins,"Been here twice, now...on both occasions a group of 5, they required a drink minimum. A drink minimum is understandable, but if you're not going to give me good service, what's the point? We were seated in a corner of the establishment on both occasions, where the service was terrible, there wasn't much lighting, and you couldn't really see much of the band. I had no desire to stay, and was given a hard time when trying to leave without reaching the drink minimum. For what it is....it's a nice place, but I won't be coming back with anyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bryanelgreat
50,Hip Vibe & Hot Music - rock on ALMOST CLASSY!,"Feels like retro sixties, cool aquarium, beautiful people, and when ALMOST CLASSY played, the place ROCKS! Check it and the band out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1whoknowsT

30,"Good atmosphere, fabulous music, mi$take$ made.......","The atmosphere is wonderful! the live music on June 25th was fabulous! the food and the drinks take way tOO long, and please please make sure the items on your check are correct! they made MANY ""mistakes"" at the time of check out. Even tried to over charge me after I paid... I am in a conversation with them so that they fix the charges on my card (aprox 22% more of the actual amount) ... fun is just fun.... should not be this hard and extra work.... should I go there again hope the service and attention to detail is how it should be. thanks. For now just an ""average"" they could get a higher rating in the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelissaPorras
50,Fun Down Under!,"It was the Friday before Valentine's Day and we had just left the Perch when we walked by a doorman and we heard music and laughter coming from down below. We decided to check it out and we walked down an ornate staircase and entered a basement filled with an aquarium and eclectic decor along with a wonderful mix of patrons. Steve a very sociable and affable bartender made us all delicious craft cocktails infused with an assortment of flavors. The Vibe was high energy and fun, fun, fun! The seating was comfortable and surrounded the center stage that showcased the musicians. They serve an assortment of bar food to appease the hungry. We had one of the best times that night! Go and lose yourself to the magic! However, take Uber so you can enjoy yourself and not worry about the drive home! Oh, and take 2 aspirins before you hit the sack!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ValentineRosie
