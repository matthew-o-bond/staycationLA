50,Beautiful views of the ocean and area,"Very nice views especially on sunny clear days. Lots of people around, but most instanced from each other. Seems like an inviting and peaceful place to relax and enjoy the waves and ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DM_1278
50,A must,"If you are driving the Malibu Coast, a stop at Dume is a must. We have been living in Santa Monica for three years now and it is by far our favorite place to go. there are steps to go down to the beach, rock faces to climb, benches to sit, and seals, dolphins and whales. We always take visitors here. A real gem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ramen67
50,Wonderful view from top of cliff,This is a very large beach with lots of parking. (Parking is $6 per car).As we were walking the beach we saw a whale or manatee jumping in the surf.There is a hiking path up to the top of the cliff. The view from up there is wonderful.If you are a rock climber or repeller this is a great place to practice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DiFromOhio
30,Great views however parking is very difficult,If lucky you will see whales from January - April off the easy to navigate dirt path that winds around the top of Pt. Dume. Parking is a challenge with only a few spots so be prepared to wait or park far away and walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/187seanq
50,Natural beauty!,"Great spot to walk the coast, enjoy the trails to the rock overlook, and just bask in God's creation! Worth the short drive past Malibu on PCH. We ended up parking on the west side and walking up the coast to Point Dume because parking was limited on site. A nice beach walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K1092CPstevenp
30,Wish I’d read more closely about parking,"I didn’t dig into the reviews and figured a state beach would at least have a small lot but like others arrived to find no spots and ppl sitting and waiting for others to leave. We debated parking illegally as several others did and a local said they regularly swing by and ticket so my husband sat in the car while I went down to see the view and then we switched, but didn’t want to risk going up to the top in case the other had to leave the illegal parking spot- another thing to note is that I had zero cell phone there (Verizon) and my husband had minimal (at&t) so be specific if trying to meet up with anyone else! There is street parking about 1/2 mile away up a side street but we had two kids with us and didn’t want to add the extra mile of walking to the stop as we were just checking it out while driving through Malibu. View is super pretty for sure though if you can grab parking or come from elsewhere!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ncdel
50,Beautiful view,"If you’re into hiking defiantly try this place specially around Feb to April. Around that time of the year you get to see the poppies and beautiful view of the ocean mixed with greenery. 2019 was an exception as far as poppies (those little colorful flowers, usually yellow or orange) but even on a regular year you get to see some around that time of the year. The hiking is very mild but just keep in mind that you’ll be hiking mainly in sand so be prepared for that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Minoolifediaryinsta
20,Parking inadequate,"I have not given this review a 2 star because it is poor in terms of beauty; I have given it a 2 because of lack of access to view the beauty! Perhaps it was because we visited in August, but with only 8-10 parking spaces available at Point Dume, it is inadequate.This is also a residential area, so I can understand that they don't want their neighbourhood turned into a carpark but a few extra spaces wouldn't hurt. Especially seeing as there doesn't seem to be any other legal parking until you reach Zuma Beach (quite some distance walk away).Looked lovely from the road over the headland but unfortunately there were no parking spaces at the time we arrived (even after we had driven around a few times).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grays_on_Holiday
50,Absolutely Beautiful,This is the most beautiful beach with the wonderful smell of the Pacific Ocean! Lovely to walk along the water and the rocks on the far south side are stunning. The parking is not expensive and I just love this area of Malibu.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindadZ603HZ
20,No parking,"Unable to see the park as there was no parking within a better part of a mile of the park. View looked nice from the parking area as waiting for a spot. Sheriffs Deputy stopped by and wrote a ticket or two, so be careful if you decide to do any questionable parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neals241
40,Beautiful beach,"Calmer waves than Zuma, nice beach and sand. Didn't use the restroom, so not sure how clean those are. Plenty of paid parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NGTravel335
50,Lovely,It can be awkward to find a parking spot. Be careful if you park where you shouldn't as we saw people getting a ticket.Anyway. Once you get parked and get a chance to do the short walk to the cliff and steps / path to the beach... It's stunning.Lifeguards and police patrols. Families everywhere so safe and clean beach.No alcohol allowed on the beach.Good to get in the sea but note that some waves do get a little big so hold on as they crash.Great fun.Recommended.And it wsd free !!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardBSutton
50,Nice Beach with Wonderful Hike and Views,Decent beach but the real attraction is the short hike from the beach up to the top of the bluff to enjoy the views. We saw sea lions and dolphins from a great vantage point.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X5966ZPdavids
50,All of Malibu's charm in one spot!,"So people understand the bad ratings on parking --- there are two places to park, at the preserve (if you are doing GPS will take you here), and at the beach. The preserve has 8 spots, the beach has a ton! We were fortunate, and got the preserve. The trail is really spectacular and winds around a small out cove. There's single track along the way, and points to stop and spot either seal lions or dolphins. Wind around, and then hop over to some of the stand alone cliffs. They are less scary then they look, but you can't help feel a little queasy looking over the edge! Great way to get a combination of the best Malibu has to offer - great ocean side hike, amazing views, daring cliffs, and a fabulous beach. Great check the box spot for Malibu!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sondraw221
50,Gorgeous stop in Malibu!,You don't want to miss this beautiful place. Make sure to bring a towel and swimsuit. Showers and bathrooms are available onsite.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellietalley
30,Chaotic parking!,"We planned to stop here and to hike to the top. The beach was very busy, and parking was even more busier. We decided to drive up to the top to see if we’d have better luck. All parking was taken there too. There was also a cop around giving tickets to those that weren’t parked legally. My husband dropped 2 of us off so we could speed hike to the top to get pictures. He circled around a couple times for us. I didn’t get to spend as much time there as I wanted, but now I can say I have been there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R5453RXmichelles
10,Who's idea was to have eight parking spots?!,"This rating isn't really fair since I never got to actually see Point Dume. It's the reason why I couldn't...there's nowhere to park?! The entire park has eight spots on the side of the road, and that's it; it is illegal to park anywhere else on the Point. The spots are always filled, so you have to wait in your car in a line until someone comes back from the point and leaves. I don't know what genius designed such limited parking, but it's not even worth the wait.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frankkmauro
50,almost private beach,"Not a nicer access to the beach possible. If you want to experience, True California, check it out..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avidtraveler5
50,Gorgeous sunset 🌅,"This was the last beach I visited in Malibu before moving out of CA and I regret of not going there before. It is a perfect place to enjoy a beautiful sunset, it was amazing. I saw beautiful marine animals. Please wear comfortable shoes because you need to walk in order to reach the top of the cliff. Lovely place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/918vidalinam
50,Incredible,"This is one of my favorite places on the planet. The hike is pretty light and the views are like no other! I do an Uber drop off, its easiest. Currently there is a super bloom and it is INCREDIBLE! The hike is breath taking and very well kept. I promise you will love it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tjeatsworld
50,Beautiful,Go here! It is an easy hike (wear shoes. Preferably tennis or hiking shoes) with a great view at the end. It is part of a larger beach. The sunflowers surrounding the hiking path smell incredible. Worth the walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evemw
40,Point Dume State Beach & Preserve,"went on March 31, 2019, 6:00PM. There was cloud cover. Not much wind along the beach, but the wind will pick up at the top of the Point Dume. We go here quite often to watch the flowers and homes. I would give it a better #, if the traffic and parking is better. It is always frustrating with people trying to park far too early on the drive into the designated parking lot. The lot is a paying lot, so bring your credit card.If you want to see the flower preserve, then you will need to climb the hill at the end of the beach (at the very southern end). The climb is fairly easy. You get a great view of the ocean with the yellow flower bed behind you. There is a hidden beach behind the Point after the south side of the beach. If you want more quiet and relaxing (but less sun - because the cliff will block out the sunset) then that is the beach for you.Always relaxing, and the small eagle is always patrolling his/her territory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevenC51
50,Best beach we visited: Climb the cliff to get to the 'hidden' beach.,"While the cliff is high, the well-marked and fairly maintained path (with rails) is doable, if you're into lots and lots of steps. Only hairy place is where the steps descend into the area with the sea lions: quite a few are rotting and some are collapsed. OK if you take your time.Park in the PAY lot as far in as you can drive. The steps to the cliff are then right in front of you. Make sure you pay for parking, we saw lots of tickets on cars when we returned from our day.Surfers were out and sea lions were lounging. Possible celebrity sightings, if you're into that sort of thing.No concessions on the beach beyond the point: bring your water bottles and snacks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MplsStPaul
50,we saw whales!!!,"what a perfect beach. we were lucky enough to see some whales playing right off shore and also catch the beginning of the ""super bloom"" which was amazing! if we had more time, we would have gone back for more. definitely a great way to spend a day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RachaelLeigh
50,"Great views, limited parking.","A great hidden gem to see the Malibu coast and look back south towards Santa Monica, Venice, and the Marina del Rey coast. Parking is limited to only a handful of spots and local streets risking getting towed. Weekdays may be less crowded than weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveTheWildWest
50,I loved Pirate's Cove.,"It is a secluded area that you have to climb over rocks. Once you are there, it was worth the hike. It is not well-known so you don't have the crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dandelna
50,Wildflower Explosion. Whales. Butterflies.,We stopped during a road trip North. It was well worth the side trip. Wildflowers are in full bloom. After a short hike we were reward with a whale sighting in the surf-line. Butterflies are everywhere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorenn2014
40,Beautiful flowers,"It's amazing to see cali in the spring. Such gorgeous flowers. The wildlife is wonderful, I had a great time here. The trails are not easily traveled. Most are not easily navigated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/codyk214
50,Beautiful but watch out for the death stairs,"Point Dume was absolutely stunning!! We sought it out after finding that it was the filming site of some scenes from Iron Man. It’s absolutely beautiful in real life and was super quiet when we went - almost no one else on the beach, just us and the surfers. It’s a bit rocky but there are some sandy spots to chill. One thing to watch out for is the stairs that lead down to the beach - they are dangerous and scary!! Many missing or loose planks so be careful as you go down. Parking was also a bit difficult. But those were the only drawbacks - it’s a lovely little spot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaelaceleste
30,Never after dark,"We were there at sunset, and talking about why there were rules about not being there at night. When were were accosted by a very distressed ill man. We then realised that everyone else had disappeared. He drove his car blocking us in and kept revving up. He went away and came back shouting and threatening. We called the Police. It took 20 minutes for them to come. In the end nothing happened but we realised that it was quite an isolated spot.There is lots of parking spaces and good public toilets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catherinemL8442JB
50,BEAUTIFUL SCENERY,"We visited, driving to the top where there is a small but free parking area. We had to wait a few minutes for a spot. We then walked a trail to the edge of the cliff to see the view towards Santa Monica. We then hiked down to the beach below. The stairs are quite worn and a few didn't seem safe to step on, but the framing was still solid so we just held on tight and went for it . The beach was nice, but not very wide. Tidepools are the attraction here, but it was high tide when we were there so maybe next time. We hiked back up and then to the top of the point and saw sealions on the rocks below. Then down on the beach to the other side of the point there was a film crew shooting an army attack on the beach so that was interesting to watch for a bit. There is a beach with a lot of parking down there, but we did not get a chance to check that part out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jknechtly
50,Beautiful hike & place to watch the sunset,"We try to make it to this park each time we are in the area. The walking trails are great for our family, including our two year old. There are awesome views and it’s a great place to watch the sunset!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BriannaNic
50,Very beautiful,"Beautiful place, would definitely recommend a stop here. Rusty stairs leads down to the water where you can see starfish.Its not easy to get a parking spot, theres just seven of them total. Theres no parking in the entire neighborhood. You could walk from the public parking by the beach but thats probably a 30 minute hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stefanf590
50,Spectacular View,"From Los Angeles we drove about 20-30 minutes head to Malibu and found this beauty. Looking over the pacific ocean itself, stunning! There’s a hiking trail as well if your up for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yogawithdorie
50,What a beautiful place to visit. The views are the best on the Coast of the LA Metroplex,"We spent the morning walking the beach with family and grandkids. A great experience and what a joy to see both the seals, the whales and the dolphins. The trail up to the point is a little dicey with children, definitively need to hold the hands and watch the little ones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/840JohnB840
30,Oh the climb!! Wear the right shoes as it’s sandy and very steep!,"We stopped here on a whim as we are travelling up the PCH.it’s worth it for the views but we didn’t prepare with the right footwear.The climb is quite challenging for compete novices, a bit perilous in places as there aren’t proper continuous barriers at the edges.But we saw eagles and sea lions and a fab view. Definitely take the cameraParking was easy enough and plentiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshBush
50,OMG Close to Perfection,"It's not Hawaii or a private beach on the Greek Islands...but it's pretty darn close for a Southern California beach. Avoid large crowds, city congestion, noise, and trash. Park right on the sand for free or enter the lot for a few bucks. From your car, walk 50 steps to a quintessential socal beach. Oh, and keep your eyes out for celebrities :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noeadventures

40,"Good Views, Horrible Parking, Quite a Hike","I wanted to see the tide pools at Point Dume. The directions I found here said to park at the trailhead in a residential neighborhood. There are only 6 spots total. There was no hope for us to snag one. We decided to park at Zuma and hike over. It is a challenging hike. Fine sand, uphill, a rocky bit, very little boardwalk on the Zuma side. We got about 1/3-1/2 way and decided to turn around. Beautiful views and beach. This is one of the most photographed parts of California coastline and has appeared in many movies. I would love to try and go again as I've never seen a tide pool in person. We saw a gathering of seals sunning on the beach and barking below the point.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amstrickland
50,One of the Best Beaches I Have Visited,"Made our way to Point Dume for the day. We usually go to Zuma, but we thought we would switch things up. I am glad we did. Parking was cheap and several spots were available. To clarify, that is down by the beach and not at the top of the bluff. There were way fewer people at Dume. Drive to the end of the lot and park/set up towards the rocks. The rocks are fun to climb on and make for great pictures. Hike over the rocks, and there is another beach. It's much more secluded. I will definitely go back next time I am in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bdfenwick

50,Point Dume is a tiny gem of a park with a monumental view of a lapis lazuli seascape and sky,The trail to various overlook points is probably just a bit more than a one mile 15 minute hike but the beauty will inspire you to stay much longer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobinHeydenberk
50,Great Hike,"Wonderful moderate hike up Point Dume. The views from the top are certainly worth it. While some people choose to scale the rock wally to reach the top, I would recommend the stroll up the trail alongside the mountain. Insider suggestion. Park at the Sunset restaurant and walk up the beach to Point Dume. Really beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coryw697
50,"Great day, great waves, great views!","Made a point to get there early on Friday. Arrived at 8:30AM and had our choice of parking. To take advantage of cool temps, immediately did the hike up Point Dume. Of course, the views were unbelievable...great photo ops. Spent the rest of the days on the beach, riding the waves, eating, having fun. Make note of the undertow. The lifeguard we interacted with was very helpful. Bathrooms = yikes!, but I guess that's to be expected. We stayed for around 6 hours. Would absolutely return to Point Dume on next trip to Malibu. p.s. Don't forget the sunscreen!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillC_ATX
40,Nice and peaceful beach,We went here with our kids (8 and 5) and they really enjoyed the beach. Parking is limited so go a bit early in the day if possible. If you are lucky you might find street parking if not there is a paid parking lot. The beach is pretty clean and the bonus for us was a pod of dolphins that seemed to be putting up a show for the folk so the beach!!. In our opinion this is a much better beach than Zuma which is always crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/XperioXperson
50,Great little hike and views!,This was the perfect place for my daughter's first hike. It didn't take more than 15 mins or so to get to the top and my 2 year old did the whole thing. The views were great at the top and there were multiple trails to go in different areas for pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheljowo
50,"Huge beach, not too busy.","When we arrived we parked on the street which was free then walked along to the cliff side. We laid out on the beach and spotted some dolphins swimming close to the shore which was lovely to see!If you climb over the cliff there is a small hidden cove, which would have been lovely if there wasn’t already quite a few people there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelenJ2250
50,Easy to park and best beach,Park in the car park end of westward beach road - 15 dollars for the day. Great beach far better than any other in the area and fairly quiet compared to Zuma ! Much more pleasant love it !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markhH8098WY

50,Tranquil morning with my son at Point Dume,A very tranquil morning visit to Point Dume. Arrived at 10am on a sunny day. Walked the beach all the way to the big rock which was being conquered by some fearless climbers.Walked up the trails to the top to view the landscape. Absolutely gorgeous panoramic views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pauldtravelman
50,Wonderful View,What a wonderful view of the coastline! We were there late morning and was able to see a few sea lions from the cliff.Parking can be a pain due to only a handful of spots at the bottom of the cliff. The beach has parking - a free area and a paid area. If you park there you will have to walk a little ways to get to the beginning of Point Dume. We parked in the residential community on Dume Dr. & Grayfox St. That added almost a mile to our hike but it was totally worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vineshakbrown
50,Best Beach and Hiking,"This is a great beach to enjoy the view and the sand. The water can be rough so be cautious about swimming. There are lifeguards. There is a great short hike to the top of Pt. Dume at the end of the beach with beautiful vistas. In the spring the Giant Coreopsis are blooming, which is an exceptional sight. These plants are rare and are only found on some of the offshore Channel Islands and a few mainland locations, this being one of them. They explode with yellow flowers and green foliage only for about a month and then they look dead for another year.This is a nice place to see Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins playing in the surf.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonyk220
40,Nice Beaches and great wildlife,"This is a very nice place to relax a little and habe a break when you are leaving LA and heading north on the PCH 1.It is definitely worth to stop and enjoy the sun, the white beaches and the Wildlife.Actually we have seen some wales, travelling by, when we were on top of the cliffs and did enjoy the splendid view.It wasn't that crowded when we showed up at 11am on a sunday morning, but the parking lot was full when we left around 4.Worth a ride from LA to escape the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Turbonero

Of course, the lizards will be present as well.The coastline is amazing, simply beautiful. Must-visit when in the area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marcell1989
40,Amazing views... but scary path to the beach,"The views were simply amazing, but I was really surprised at the condition of the hiking path to get down to the beach. Parts of the trail seriously consisted of balancing yourself across a large metal drainage pipe. We met a woman in her 60s who plain refused to try attempting the trail and I didn't blame her. The metal stairs which lead you onto the beach were in a state of unkept .. I was stunned. The metal was rusting through - there were large holes. Some had been covered with wood.. while others had not. That being said-- the views and the beach are gorgeous. As the other reviewers said- I think there are like four parking spots.. two handicapped. Definitely not ideal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jennifermq
40,Malibu Experience,Overall we were genuinely underwhelmed by Malibu but this place was awesome. Well kept beach and worth the drive to avoid some of the crowds that stop closer to L.A. water was freezing and wind was cold in late March!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dreww238

50,Gorgeous - Must see while in Malibu!,"This park has beach access and the views are spectacular! Parking is along the road in front of the park. There are paths that walk along the top of the park, looking down on the beach & Pacific Ocean. The stairs down to the beach are ok - some have been fixed. Once on the beach, you can take a long walk along the sandy beach or the rocks on the coast. Definitely one of my favorite places to escape for amazing beauty!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/olivergumbrill
20,Cliffs and not so pleasant sights,"I always enjoy the beauty of the beach and ocean, but even more so when the rocks and cliffs accent it. There are several trails and you can see the curve of cliffs along the Malibu coast.One major drawback is that there is really limited parking, but we came fairly early in the morning and found a spot fairly quickly.Another is that no dogs are allowed in the park or on any of the trails or beach. I found this to be sad, because we are conscientious pet owners and would have loved to take our dog along.Unfortunately we encountered a drunk homeless man along the trail, who would not move off the path for us. He reeked of body odor and alcohol. He was drinking from his glass alcohol bottles and then tossing them over the cliffs and into the bushes. Our dog would have been less destructive. Just saying....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RNRVTraveler
50,Short visit to Malibu,I always love Zumba Beach no matter what time of year it is. This visit I went for early morning walks and it was so quiet and the sea was calm.. very tranquil. It’s different up most of the beaches stretched along the coast as it’s on a quiet road off the Pacific Coast Highway. People walk their dogs on leashes in the early morning and when the waves are bigger the surfers are out.The sunrise coming up over Santa Monuca in the distance is beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/59Cathy
40,Peaceful Sunrise,I drove out to the furthest parking point at the beach then hiked up the hill (10 minutes) to get a lovely sunrise view from the wooden deck. It was really easy and certainly worth it for some morning meditation and/or photography. The sign says no dogs but I think that isn’t highly enforced. They also have restrooms by the parking which is convenient.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/courtnieclemens
50,"Best beach, save some time for a vist","What a sight! I’m happy my wife and I took time to go here. We found parking in the neighborhood up on Point Dume and walked for about 10 minutes (easy). You won’t be disappointed with your visit here. Walking out to the point features a rocky beach for a long distance view to the left. There’s stairs to go down there as well. When we walked out to the tip of the point we saw sea lions down on the rocks. There was a big group of them and they were making a lot of noise. Going further you look down onto “Pirates Cove” beach. This beach was featured in movies previously. We unfortunately did not go down there, but there was only two people on that beach. The climb down is steep- proper footwear and limited belongings are crucial. On the other side of Pirates Cove was Zuma beach, a long expansive beach, accessible from Point Dume. We wish we could have spent more time here as there was plenty of photo/video opportunities and places to explore. If you’re traveling to the Malibu area, be sure to stop here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/28mitchm
50,Best Beach in Malibu,"Looking for the best beach to spend the day? Look no further than Point Dume Beach, where many feature films are shot there for it's stunning view, such as Planet of the Apes, Iron Man, D-Day the Sixth of June just to name a few. You will be thankful you heard it from me... :)Make sure you drive all the way to the end, park in the parking lot at the end, where you will reach the best spot of the beach. You can lay on the beach, boogie board in the ocean, climb the rocks or body explore the coast. AMAZING!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SheenaGao

Bathrooms are available. Go to the very end of the parking lot to access the hiking trail that will take you up above the cliffs, where you can look down on a pod of sea lions, and continue over to the steps that go down the cliff. Time your visit for low tide, and go out and explore. My daughter found Octopus and many anenome. Back at the beach next to the parking lot, we saw a whale swim by. You might even see dolphin playing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lee-Tarbet
40,Cliff top dramatic view of the ocean and beach,A 20 min mid-level climb will land you on top of a cliff at the end of the beach with dramatic view of the ocean looking out and secluded beach looking down.

50,On your trek up Highway 1 take a break at Point Dume,"On your trek up Highway 1 take a break at Point Dume. Plan a full day between Los Angeles and Ventura on your exploration of the Malibu Coast. Take time for the pier, wander Point Dume, time it for the tide pools at Leo Carrillo, lunch at Neptune’s Net, and a hike up the Ray Miller trail at La Jolla Canyon for the sunset over the Channel Islands. The drive up the coast to Ventura.This is a review of Point Dume and I got carried away. This is such a world class coastal drive. Get out of your car and take a walk on the beach. Check out the coastal mansions that cover the area. Just a fun walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
40,Beautiful hike,"After swilling beers in Malibu I recommend a quick hike at Point Dume to gain your bearings. The beauty is captivating, and the walk is perfect for bloated beer drinkers: not too far, and short enough.The only problem is the lack of parking. So go on a weekday when the tourists are away. Don't forget your camera.The Statue of Liberty from the original Planet of the Apes movie must've washed away because I didn't see it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JonathanHeatt
40,Beautiful beach!,"This place is a definite must see! The beach, the views... everything was beautiful. The weather was really nice on the day we were there but the water was a bit cold... and the waves were big! It was fun!! Will totally come back to check out the trails...Parking is not easy though. There's a paid parking lot ""nearby"" and limited spaces outside. We had to drive around a few times until we found a spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gloria_morato
50,MUST SEE!,One of the most gorgeous views on the PCH. Not far at all from Malibu.. parking is not the easiest. I believe you can pay to park in parking lot next to 26 Beach and walk up there.. both times I have gone to Point Dume I have waited to park next to trail head. But it is the most gorgeous view of the Pacific you will see. Cool to watch the surfers and see the tide pools below. GREAT PHOTO OP!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/funwithAmyJane
50,Beautiful,I was taken away by the beauty of the beach and the views from the hills above. Plenty of walking trails for the adventures along with groups with toddlers. Our 3 year old granddaughter loved seeing the seals and pelicans along with the waves coming into the beach getting her feet wet. This is a must if you’re in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/685michellec
40,Easy scenic hike,Stunning ocean views with comfortable ocean overlook with benches. Could have sat there all day. Has a beach. Dogs are NOT allowed. Limited parking. BEWARE. Malibu is not tourist friendly. Our car's bumper over hung one foot over a marketed off area in front and behind one handicap space. Car in the spot was three feet behind us. Ok right? WRONG!

10,Stay away! Lions and tigers and bears ... and landsharks!,"I love how deserted this beach is so I'm down-rating it to discourage stupid people who judge things by star ratings instead of reading reviews. On the plus side there is nothing here to attract people except a clean beach at the base of the Malibu cliffs and, you know, whales. Surf can be rough at times and there are dangerous rocks lurking just below the surface. Strongly recommend you head back to Zuma Beach immediately.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobrM244WP

40,Beautiful Trail Along the Coast,Point Dume is less crowded than most beaches in Malibu which makes it great to visit. There's a lovely trail atop that you take along the coast with beautiful views of the ocean,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nass673
50,Stunning View From the Top!,"If you go to Zuma Beach, it's almost mandatory to go to Point Dume as well. The view from there is absolutely stunning. It's important to be patient and wait for the sun to go down. You won't be disappointed. From the top of Point Dume, you can see for literally miles in both directions down the coast. It's recommended that you get to the top an hour or two before the crowds get there, so you can find a nice place to sit and watch the sunset. By the time that happens, prepare to be surrounded my 20 somethings who bring their dates up here to impress them with the view.The hike isn't a big deal, albeit, if you are as active as a chair you'll probably doing yourself a favor if you take your time. Same thing with going down. It isn't a difficult hike, but in case you are questioning your fitness level, get there early enough to beat the crowds. Otherwise, you are going to annoy everyone who is trying to get a good vantage point, as they watch you plod towards your destination like a tired donkey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LucianoLeon
40,"Nice view, lots of Sea Lions","This is a good stop for taking in a good view of the Malibu coast and taking some good pictures. When we visited there were lots of Sea Lions in the water and on the rocks, easily viewable.Parking is very limited, I let my family go while I waited, took about 20 minutes for a spot to open up. Seems like nobody observes the parking spot markings, if there are 10 marked spots, there were 15 cars parked in them, just make sure to give yourself and others room to get out. I saw one car nearly blocked in, took the driver a while to work their way out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/952robinh
50,Gorgeous,Stunning scenery. Quite a hike down rickety stairs to get to the rocky bottom and then make your way over to the beach. Highly recommend decent shoes. Local place for surfers. Lots of tourists. Very small parking area (like maybe 10 spots). We got lucky and only had to wait a few minutes for a spot to open up. Reportedly seals and sea lions are spotted here often but we didn't see any.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krisgils33
50,Ironman Tony Stark's place in the movie,"In the movie Ironman, Tony Stark says he lives at ""Malibu Point"", he was really referring to Point Dume (the only point in Malibu). While there was no signs of his Ironman suite or Mr. Stark, there are lovely sand dune trails meandering around the bluff. Along the trail are unique animals like really small lizards, they pose for pictures, but then can run really really fast! Almost comically fast.Beautiful views of Santa Monica bay and the shoreline of Malibu. Parking seemed inconspicuous (a small sandy pull over at the front).There is a beach/cove down there, but I couldn't find where the trail leads down. And you certainly couldn't walk down over the rocks (and over the cliff). But the views are magnificent. No dog walking allowed here because of the sensitive ecosystem, ancient sand dunes native animals, are very sensitive to dog and other animals urine scent. This place must look something at sunset!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/718gregoryj
50,Mesmerizing views!,"A beautiful place to go for a hike. At the point you will have mesmerizing views of Dume Cove, Pirats Cove, Westward Beach all the way up to Zuma or just sit and gaze into infinity of the Pacific Ocean. We were lucky to catch the sea lion pups playing in the waves, the females sunning and napping on the rocks and the alhpa-bull roaring up a in song. We walked down to Dume Cove all the way over to the point leading to Little Dume Beach. It’s not the easiest beach to get to in part because of the limited parking as well as the long hike down. The 6 car lot has a 2 hour limit, so instead we parked on Grasswood Avenue and walked back up. I do not recommend this trek for those offended by naturists. There were a half dozen or so camped out in tents flying their nudist flags. The water was not so pacific when we were there and too rough for swimming, but it was nice with a dunk to cool off. We attempted hiking up “off piste” which I do not recommend. The sand and gravel makes this nearly impossible without endless back sliding, meanwhile getting covered in clay dust.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HnossDesign
30,Quiet for a reason,"We saw this beach but parking was such a nightmare that it put a damper on the whole afternoon. We were enjoying the coast and read the reviews and figured we could tolerate the parking but if you don’t go early, there isn’t parking. Actually something should be done about the parking but then t does contribute to the fact that it isn’t crowded. In any case, be early or just skip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3743BSdaniela

50,Nice view!,"Nice place to visit with a great view. The history about he place can be read in the boards. If you are found to park your car near the parking lot, be aware about the fares: 3 dollars before 9 am, 8 dollars after 9 am and 15 dollars during weekends.From the top of the point you can see the beach and some of the houses over the cliff. Very interestingPs: the house from the film (iron man) is over there....easy to see",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lisandra11
50,Amazing views,"We went during February because it was a pretty warm day, so why not go to the beach. The day we were there the flowers were in bloom. So everything around us was bright yellow, plus the views... it was a perfect day. You can hike along little paths that are not very hard or long, so it's great for small children. The stairwell on the side that takes you down to the beach was a plus. The only negative about this place is the parking. There is no parking lot, and only 3 or4 parking spots are right by the place, and they are usually taken. So you have to park far away because it's a residential area and there are no parking signs everywhere. So have in mind you might have to walk a bit to get to the place, but it's totally worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rahymapadron

50,Great few hours,"Went on a Sunday and it was busy but not over crowded by any means. About a half hour drive up beach from Santa Monica. The parking is a nightmare. The top lot is free but has only a few spaces. You can drop off passengers here though. The bottom lot is a pay lot which had a queue that was at least 50 cars long. The majority of these cars were trying to park to access the beach and not point dume. I drove back up to the top lot, passed it, and then took a left on what I believe was grassland? Anyhow, it is the only street i found in the residential area that allows for street parking. It is also closer to point dume than parking in the bottom lot and is free! Walk the path down to the beach on the south side of the point and you'll find tidal pools full of treasures. It's all an easy hike for anyone in okay shape. Small children will need to be carried.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SassyAtlanta

50,Absolutely Stunning!,"I am so glad we stopped here on our coastal road trip! We stopped here later in the day, around 5pm, which made for a beautiful skyline as we took in the coastal views and climbed the rocks. The views were absolutely stunning and we enjoyed our pleasant little hike! Although the weather was a bit chilly, this spot is just too beautiful to enjoy no matter the weather.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/207danae
50,Love this beach,"We were visiting LA and wanted to get in some climbing and beach time. Point Dume was perfect for both. The biggest issue was finding parking at Point Dume. The upper parking area could maybe fit 4-5 cars and was always full and a park ranger was there making sure no one double parked or lingered. But the upper lot was free. The lower lot was large and had facilities but was a pricey place to park. We unfortunately had to pay the fee and park in the lower parking area. The beach itself is quite wide and there are three main stations on the beach with facilities like bathrooms and showers. Now, we came here to do some climbing. The cliff at Point Dume juts out into the ocean on the north end of the beach. There are several bolted routes here with top anchors. You can actually walk up from the shoulder of the cliff up to the top of the routes and throw down top ropes here on most of the routes. We elected to just sport lead up since the grades here were on the lite moderate at best, at least along the beach side of the escarpment. The climbing was fun in the sun and we quickly drew a crowd as we climbed. There was another group that came to climb a bit after we started and everyone was very friendly. The beach is wide and sandy. We had a good time climbing here and doing some sunbathing here as well. It was a bit of a drive from LA but definitely worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natcpl2
40,Picturous,Quite nice if you live close then worthwhile seeing. There is a parking by the beach costs 3 usd but you can park for free on the top of the hill from the other side but there are only few spaces.I saw seals and sea lions during my hike. The hike is not that long .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/965micha_d
50,Great Views of the Coast and Sealife,What an amazing place! Beautiful beaches and great views. I would highly recommend hiking to the top of Point Dume and be sure to look down from the cliff while walking. We spotted at least 30 sea lions sunning on a rock. We also saw several dolphins .It was worth the $6 parking (weekdays) or $8 weekends.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidd98321
50,Sitting on the beach,Went with family to see the beach. Beautiful homes lined the cliffs. Mountains with water beneath. My son my cousin his little boy and myself climbed the point.

Saw sea lions in the ocean.Bathroom facilities available,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gabykat7

30,A short hike with tide pools,"We were probably expecting something much more strenuous and dramatic but the hike to the top of Point Dume was pretty basic with high chaparral vegetation and a few viewpoints. They were filming a Hollywood movie on the beach when we went which was kinda cool. We saw some birds, dolphins and seals. We hiked down to the tide pools (watch out for the rusted stairs) and checked out aquatic snails, anemones, and what looked like krill. Total trip can be done in less than 1-1/2 hours",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoriC768

20,Second visit,"Visited again and not a great visit. Mother Nature was not our friend. Fog moved in and it was ""socked in"" by 3 pm. You could barely see the road. California peeps said they'd never seen it like this. Bummer of a trip. I do wanted to visit the ocean!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CRodden

40,Spectacular view from the cliff,"The beach is nice, but it's not the reason to come here. Just from the back of the beach close to the cliff you can find a path that brings you to the top. Easy, but narrow in some points and no trees to protect you from the sun. The view from the top is awesome. If you have small kids consider that there are no protections.This is a natural reserve, so sit down, relax and sometimes sea lions or dolphins make themselves visible.The parking for entering the beach is $8.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/csirio
40,NIce time,"I enjoyed this beach, however I enjoyed El Matador much more just down the road. I came in February so the parking lot was closed maybe if I could have parked closer to the point I would have enjoyed it more. I would be willing to try again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vsisnero
40,Definitely worth your time,"The beach at Pt. Dume and the view from the point are wonderful. If you hike up the to the point from the beach, you will need to be in decent shape. Though the trails are wide enough for easy passage, there are a few steep spots, and some recent erosion (due to the rains in Jan./Feb. 2017) of the sides of the trails makes footing a bit challenging in a couple of spots.The point is also accessible from a residential street on the backside of the bluff. I saw cars parked along the street, but since we didn't start from there I don't know how easy it is to find parking.The view of the ocean, islands, the L.A. area, and down the coast to Palos Verdes is spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brettmI2598CL

40,Lovely as long as you don't mind a crowd,"I was trying to get here for the sunset and I would have, if I hadnt had to drive around for 20 minutes to find parking then hike a mile to the point. For such a popular place, there is only a small strip of dirt that might fit 20 compact cars, tops. And the rest of the area is a neighborhood with ""no parking"" signs. I eventually found a spot on the side of the road a mile away without the dreaded signs but I missed the sunset. With minimal daylight, I didnt hike the full point but noticed people on the cove below so obviously there is a way to get down there. There is a cliff that is roped off but everyone disregards it because it's the best spot for photos. Just watch your step! I wouldnt recommend taking small kids or dogs along that cliff. In fact, there is a sign that says ""no dogs"" but that doesn't stop folks from bringing their best friend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BooBooKatie

50,VISIT THIS PLACE,This place is gorgeous. Tiny parking area as it's in a nice neighborhood. Perhaps 8 spaces and police there to make sure you don't park illegally. Great family friendly hiking around the cliffs with a huge (if not rusty) staircase taking you down to the cove. Not crowded at all and just incredibly gorgeous.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dragonflycafe

50,Rugged Malibu,"My favorite place in all of Los Angeles County and I live here. If you can find parking at the microscopic lot, you can take advantage of a short hike down the steep stairs to tide pools. One time we found a small octopus in a tide pool during low tide - the kids fed it sea snails. You can hike up to the top of the hill for a gorgeous view, and along the cliff's edge and over and down to other, rugged beaches towards Zuma Beach. We almost always see dolphins here. We don't swim at Point Dume so much, though. It's more of a hiking/exploration place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaJeHo
40,Beautiful!,Definitely worth the stop if you're causing the PCH. I wasn't able to find a good place to park. A park ranger said I could park at Zuma Beach but that comes with an $8.00 price tag. I was able to find a space for a few minutes so I could take some pictures. Would have loved to spend more time there. Very tranquil place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xavierx101
40,Gorgeous overlook,This is a nice easy hike and the overlook is beautiful. The trip down to the beach is not any easy one. I would say only those in good shape should tackle that one. The steps are not in the best condition either. The sea lions are fun to watch and the view is beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ambr64
40,Sweet view!,I got here by bus and walked another half an hour to get here. The walk is not too bad and is pretty worth it. I would recommend bringing some food with you unless you're down to eating at a nearby restaurant (that you'll see as you head down) I was enjoying the beach for a bit (don't really recommend going in) and just climbed some rocks to get a better view and then climbed to the top of the point. Pretty dope place!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fifi1292

50,Great for tide pools.,"Go to the Pt. Dume headlands, park nearby on Grasswood if no parking available at the Pt., go to the stairway that will lead you down to the beach. At low tide, this is Malibu's best place to walk the tide pools. We've seen lots of starfish, an octupus, sea sponges, and more. Not so much lately though-not sure why. But still a great walk. Be warned, a long stairway, safe, but not for those with an aversion for lots of steps.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reyc632
50,Wow!!!,We absolutely loved our walk up to point Dume: the views are amazing! Parking is a challenge but definitely worth the wait if you have time. It gets very hot so I would make sure everyone has their water bottle. The trails are well indicated and well maintained so anyone who can walk can go and take in those beautiful vistas!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Najebo

50,Fantastic views!,"This is one of my new favorite places in the LA area! My friend and I spent the perfect morning at Point Dume. It's hard to find parking (you'll have to share with all of the surfers!) but we managed to sneak into a spot on a side street as someone was leaving. We walked up the cliff, past all of the little lizards playing in the sand and got to the top where there was an absolutely fantastic view! Down below when you look over the side, you can see sea lions playing on the rocks. We even saw a ray swimming down in the shallows because the water was so clear! It was amazing. After our little hike, we went down to sit on the rocks, soak up some sun, and watch the surf. It was a perfect day. Definitely recommend this! It's an easy ""hike"" (more like a walk up a steep hill) but if you want to go down to the beach, be careful as it's a very steep rickety old staircase.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adrie_enne
50,The Beauty of the NorCal Coast Right Here in Malibu,"I've live in LA for a long long time and never went to the South side of Point Dume, and wow, was I surprised! It's gorgeous, like the rock strewn beaches of Northern California and farther up the coast. Definitely check it out!You can hike around and soak in the views, but getting to the beach there is only for the intrepid. We couldn't figure out how to get down there -- other than swimming around the Point. That's certainly how the sea lions got there. Yes, we saw half a dozen sea lions!The only catch is the parking. You can park in a big lot on the North side of the Point -- but then you only have a regular (beautiful) beach and can only see the Point itself. You want to park on the south side of the Point, that is, south of the blue ""Circles"" buildings to take in the beautiful coastline. But that's easier said than done. There's a parking strip for about a dozen cars, but good luck with that! We found a spot by driving only one block away and going up the hill a bit -- till you don't see any ""No Parking"" (bring your lawyer along to decipher the signs). Then, it's a short walk back to the Point area. And hey, you're there to hike around anyway.There are a bunch of little trails all over the Point. There's little reason in trying to tell you which ones to take. Just go. You won't regret it! Like life, 95 percent of enjoying this place is just showing up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Drucksterino
40,Beautiful and very chilly in August,"Visited in August around 6pm and it was very chilly and most people were leaving for the day. The stairs to get down are VERY steep and rusted and not in good shape so I do not recommend to anyone with vertigo issues, extraordinarily clumsy or very young/old. Once you're down you'll have to hike over very rocky terrain to get the the beach area near the cliff you see in all the pics. That in itself won't be great for anyone too old. Make sure you wear sneakers and if it were me I wouldn't bring a ton of junk with me because it would be hard to haul it over all the rocks and down those stairs. Looked like a lot of surfers were in and out and catching decent waves. I'd say this was worth the trip because I've never seen anything like it before and it really is beautiful but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sjs07f

50,Gorgeous Views,"Point Dume has great views of the ocean from the promontory. We got there about a half hour before the sunset and it was gorgeous. I'd probably recommend trying to get there an hour or two before the sunsets, though, as it was almost dark by the time we left. The trails up to the overlook aren't too long and aren't too steep, but you'll want to make sure you watch your footing, just in case. It can get a bit breezy at the top but the view is worth it.Parking can be tricky, though, as there are only about 10 parking spots along Cliffside Drive. I had to circle around a couple of times before I could get an empty spot at sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MS054
30,"Beach, Hiking, Repelling!","Point Dume State Beach, USA is a very versatile outdoor attraction. Of course there's the beach; very clean, Life Guards close by, and there are restrooms with outdoor showers to get the sand off before getting back into your car.The waves are normally rough from the southern point continuing north for all of Zuma Beach. Not advisable for young children or inexperienced swimmers in general. (the Lifeguards do an awesome job for PD & Zuma beach! try not to give them any extra work!)The hiking is very rewarding. One trail takes you to the 'Point' and the other takes you south of the point for a considerable distance. The view from the point is breathtaking! On a clear day one can see the entire Santa Monica Bay southward and then north to the end of Zuma and the next point. Very sweet! Bring binoculars for an even better experience.The repelling is novice I am told but it looks crazy to me! LOL!! One can take the hike to point, fasten hardware to anchors that have been permanently placed by the Park service, then 'fly' down. Of course, one can repel up and the take the hike back to the parking lot if one chooses. There are anchors affixed facing the beach as well as seaward.The restrooms are typical State Park, maintained so make sure you have flip-flops or other washable sandals. The week we went both Men's toilet stalls were non-functioning; 😞 my wife had to stand guard outside the Woman's facilities while I took care of business. Most embarrassing upon exit with two women waiting to enter!There is a food/drink facility in the Zuma B area. (1000 yds from PD parking.The parking is $8 for the day and is somewhat close to the seashore. Accepts MasterCard/visa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blue-Danish

50,go early,If you get up early drive past parking lot and up the hill on a residential street where you will find state beach parking (room for about ten cars). Walking trail leads up a hill with a balcony on the east side perfect for viewing sunrise (or sunset on the west side). I also saw sea lions on the rocks. Very peaceful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MOKMinnesota
50,"Pretty Views, Short but Nice Trails","Good spot to spend an hour and take in the views. I wish the trails were longer, but that's a good sign :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SurfGirl310
40,Afternoon Delight,"After hiking in Solstice Canyon I headed to this beach which I found on TripAdvisor. I parked closer to the entrance side of the beach and walked along the ocean to the cliffs (close to a mile). I love this time of day when everything has a golden hue. I walked up the path barefoot since I left my sandals in the car. Apparently there are two sides of the beach where the Point Dume Cliff separates the two. One that is a wide, long sandy beach for bathing and swimming and the other rocky with bits of sandy beach which looks more like Big Sur. I only saw it from the cliffs and didn't go down (maybe I will another day).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariahJ2379SF
50,Definitely worth the Detour,We stopped by here and were pleasantly surprised by the amount of sea life we were able to see-seals and even a few whales. It is a nice hike to the top of the peak but a little hilly but still easy to do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lloydg570
30,Beware: Point Dume State Beach does not accept the California State Beach membership placard-you pay!A,"This is a terrific pay-beach, but parking fills up very early and therefore the lot is closed to further visitors. The nearby Westward Beach has free street parking and is often a better value since you can walk in the beach to Point Dume State Beach. Beware: Point Dume State Beach DOES NOT accept the California State Park placard, so it's an exception. No idea why this beach is exempt from the California State Beach membership.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Buboard
50,Definitely stop here!,"We would not have stopped here without a guide book - so make sure you don't miss it. It's a spectacular beach you have to access by a crazy staircase from high up on a bluff, but the bluff gives you an amazing view of Malibu and the stones/water/vista on the beach is equally beautiful. There is only a small parking strip at the top, but if you wait patiently a spot will open because there are many who are stopping just for the view at the top. Don't stay up there though - definitely climb down the stairs to the water. Be careful in sandals and don't wear heels!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SDC372

40,Beautiful Beach & Wildlife,"We decided to find a quieter beach around the LA area. Point Dume State Park Beach is beautiful and clean and perfect for families. There is lots of parking (costing $$) of course.While we were there we saw dolphins swimming by as well as starfish. Very exciting to see!One negative were the washrooms. They were absolutely disgusting. Urine, dirt, etc were all over the place. I don't think they have been cleaned since they were built in the 1970s.We will definitely go back and will look forward to everything but the washrooms.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaPep
40,Beautiful view!!,It was sucha beautiful place with amazing views.. There is problem finding parking as there are very few spots next to the road..

50,Our favorite,"This is my favorite beach, anywhere. Whales! Dolphins! Sea Lions! Outrageously beautiful and clean. Perfect for beach walks. Lots of surfers. Really crowded and fun in the summer, peaceful and quiet the rest of the year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FoodInTheVillage
50,"I love this beach and preserve - great hiking, sightseeing, too!","This beach is in more movies, TV shows, commercials than any other; it's like it own sound stage, as a cliff juts out to the water line making a wall the block the view to the south - a wall people use to climb on, too.The beach itself is small and intimate,with bathroom facilities, and has a pathway that leads to hiking paths, which put you higher up to get a nice vantage point to look up and down the shoreline.From these great vantage points you can spot whales and plenty of sea lions, which does make this spot special.There is street parking on other side of the grounds, in a neighborhood setting,for hikers and sightseers.Just one of my favorite places to enjoy my day! Every time I am in the area, I make this visit! Love it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/177MarkG177
40,Hard Parking,Attempted to visit here but parking was backed up. Handicap parking but cane only on dirt trails. Not walker or wheelchair useable in my viewpoint.Looked at other areas and the view was great. Better views of the coast if you can park in designated areas. Worth seeing if you have the time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Perkadventures
40,Awesome sunset,"Stopped here on our way back to LA after driving up the spectacular Pacific Coast Highway for the afternoon. Luckily for us there was not a cloud in the sky, albeit it was very windy up on the point due to the exposure and got cold as the sun started to go down. Amazing sunset though so it was worth it in the end and I certainly recommend heading up there on a clear evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Craig_M_L_23
40,"Beautiful beach, chilly water","We visited this beach on a lovely, windy day. It's a great place to visit if you're interested in nature and hiking. Kid and family friendly, but close enough to restaurants, shopping and civilization!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susiespy
40,"Finally saw the sunset ""flash""!!","This was beautiful evening and after climbing up the cliff to see the sunset, it was definitely worth it!! Everyone was taking photos, including a couple for their engagement. If you can't manage the climb, I'm sure it was just as breathtaking from the beach as well. I think we even saw a seal below as well. Definitely worth the drive - be sre to get there in good time to see it, so you don't have to rush. this is NOT to be rushed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colleenwb
50,Beautiful Scenery,Stopped off at this beautiful reserve with my partner whilst road-tripping North. We went down onto the beach and climbed up to the top of hill. Both had just stunning views. Make sure you wear good footwear as the paths have seen better days and some of the steps are rusting away.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/423hughj
50,The best stop for me so far in Malibu!,"This is a gem of a place. The views are absolutely stunning. The hike up to the top is moderate, I'd recommend sneakers or tennis shoes. There's currently a colony of sea lions in a cove below which you can see from the outer path. This is a great spot for whale watching during the migratory season, many people I'm here with have seen them this week. You can take some rickety stairs down to a part of the beach that has amazing tides pools and beautiful cliff and rock formations. I've been there twice this week and thinking about going again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/variyajewelry
50,"A stunning, quiet beach","This gorgeous beach is a bit of a drive (around 45 mins) from Los Angeles, however it is well worth it. Away from the big lights, it is the perfect place for a relaxing swim and gives you magnificent views of the coastline",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sam_Cassaniti
50,Stunning,"Point Dume is unique and a must see in Malibu! The hike to the top is relatively easy, although sandy or rocky in a few places to be careful. Along the way, you can see directly down where there were at least 20 seals hanging out on the rocks. When I went, I was lucky enough to see 2 whales swimming by! The view from the to is stunning. Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/348kelleyy

Be careful on parking and check the street signs.Great spot for whale watching as it pt dume ends Santa Monica bay as it juts out into the pacific.Sunrise to sunset views.Easy trail that only needs flip flops and you can also use the trail/stairs to walk down to the cove and small beach.This is kinda like a secret spot and so worth it.Yes yes yes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
50,Wonderful beach,"It isn’t obvious how to get here, but this is a gem of a place. It has free parking to start with (albeit for about 6 cars). You can walk to the hill overlooking the point and go down an (extremely rickety) staircase to the beach. We saw sea lions, porpoises, and a sea of yellow flowers in bloom all along the bluff. Please keep to the walkways! You can experience this in about 30-45 minutes or take a fairly long walk along the beach if you wish. It happened to be a drizzly day, but a nice little stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/52chips
50,Take a hike! Here!,"This may just be my favorite beach in the world! From the cliffs to the beach to the waters crashing on the shore, this place is both awe-inspiring and serene at the same time.It is an awesome place to walk, surf or just sit.If you are looking for something a bit more rustic than Zuma, come to Pt Dume!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasonparkhouse
50,Sundown on the beach,Had read about Point Dume being a back drop for several movies including Planet of the Apes. Got there about forty five minutes before sundown. The sky was on fire that evening.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelJunky1962
50,Favorite beach,This is our go-to beach in Malibu. Beautiful water and the rocks at the end are perfect for finding starfish and other tide pool creatures. Its a long one lane road into the beach so get there early during the summer months so you don't get stuck waiting in line to get into the parking lot,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephsoltes
50,Stunning!!,"My family and I made a quick spring break visit to the LA area and the absolute highlight of the visit for me was Point Dume.I've wanted to visit Point Dume for years after seeing the 1994 movie Color of Night starring Bruce Willis and Scott Bakula. The house called Circles on the Point located just north of Point Dume at the corner of Cliffside and Birdview is featured prominently in the film. There are also scenes with the two stars riding bikes on the trails of Point Dume. While I enjoy the movie itself, the house's architecture has always captured me. After finding the location of the house years ago, I looked more into the area around it and just wanted to visit that much more.Most people don't know Color of Night and won't know of any movie connection with the house, but many will recognize the beach below the point from the ending scene of the original 1968 Planet of the Apes. It's not as obvious, but Tony Stark's mansion was digitally built on the top of Point Dume for the first Iron Man movie and many other movies were filmed in the area.Beyond the Hollywood connections, Point Dume has beautiful beaches and simply stunning beauty. A short hike up the trails to the top of the Point reveals beautiful views of the coast up and down the Malibu shore. The tall grass and wildflowers were in full bloom on my visit, making for a great walk. March is the middle of the whale migration season, and from the top of the Point my family and I were able to spot several whales out in the ocean. Climbing around the rocks at the end of Westward Beach, we also encountered a sea lion taking in some sun on the rocks.Parking at Westward Beach is unattended. There are several kiosks up and down the parking lot where you can pay via cash or credit/debit card. I parked at the far end of the lot closest to Point Dume and conveniently across from the restrooms.I can't imagine any other SoCal beaches being as beautiful and I hope that last week's visit will not be my last.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1badgmc
50,Spectacular experience!!!,This place is fantastic! Of course it was set up for my niece's wedding so the moment was superb and the experience amazing!! I hope I'd get back to the West Coast and enjoy this beach a bit more! ;-),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dinonasi
50,Do not miss!,"This was one of my favorite stops in southern California! Nice wide trail leads to the most spectacular view! Not a strenuous climb but it is a ""long hill at moderate grade"" on a nice gravel trail.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/420jeane
50,Wonderful short hike to see wildflowers and wild animals,"I visited with a friend on a weekday in March to see the wildflowers blooming. We started our day with yoga on the beach. It was so relaxing to work out to the sounds of the waves and the seagulls. Many pelicans were gliding by along the top of the cliffs.After yoga, we took a walk up the short trail to the Pt. Dume Nature Preserve. The coreopsis were in bloom in a spectacular field of yellow. We walked to the peak and enjoyed the views of ocean on three sides of us. I kept an eye out for whales, but didn’t see any. After coming down from the peak we took the trail around the perimeter. Binoculars came in handy. My favorite part was watching the sea lions over the side of the cliff. There were so many of them, probably at least 50. They were in the water, on rocks, and on the shore. We could hear them grunting and calling, and smelled a very fishy smell. We also caught sight of dolphins out in the water.Afterward we had lunch at Kristy’s up on the hill, enjoying a delicious pizza and the beautiful views from the patio.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/357SusanD

40,Amazing sunset spot.,"Amazing spot to watch a California sunset.The preserve has some trails and hill that serves as a center point. The spot offers about a 180 degree view of the ocean broken into two sections. On one side, you can see the sunset and in the order the hilltop houses.The biggest issue is the limited parking. If you are visiting to watch the sunset, you need to arrive 30 minutes to an hour prior to ensure you get a spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mcrivera53

50,Great walk on the beach,Its cool walking on the beach. Theres a walkway down from the road to the beach. You can see some of the houses up on the road have their own private walkway down. For obvious reason they are private and video camera enabled. Its cool to see. Some have an electric tram going down. One even looked like he had a hole on the side of the bluff.Lots of dead birds though when we walked and 1 dead seal. Kinda sad,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jangjangjang
50,Amazing,"I was vacationing in Malibu for a week, I was hiking here everyday. Just amazing views, I was there in November so the weather was a bit unpredictable. It was cool and really windy one day, the next warm with a slight breeze. I highly suggest coming here, Zuma Beach is fairly close as well. Hiking shoes or tennis shoes are best, I would not suggest flip flops. There are seals at the deck and seating area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lyssaf26
50,Best beach in LA,"This is the best beach in Los Angeles. Although far from the actual city it is a good visit when in LA. The beach is very clean with clear water. On good days the waves are great for good surfers. I have even seen snorkel before. Lots of wildlife. I have seen seals, whales, fish, bunnies, deer, and birds. The area is beautiful and the hiking trail to get to the beach is great. Parking is not a problem because when there is no space you just park in the neighborhood and walk to the trails.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lngtraveler123
50,Something for everyone,"We were here only for an after noon but spending the whole day here is not a bad idea at all if you enjoy walking, hiking, climbing or just the beach. You have to bring your own food. Parking for a small fee. The sunset was stunning. We even saw a few dolphins jumping in the ocean. Wouldn't love to go back if in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kattsvansen
40,Great Views,"A pretty short (but fairly steep at the beginning) hike will take you to some beautiful views. It is sandy and rocky in places so consider that when choosing footwear.I can see that in peak season this place would be packed, but I easily scored free street parking (in fact the closest possible parking spot before the paid area) when I visited recently in the middle of a Friday morning. In the paid parking area there were maybe 20 cars. I also noticed a sign that those with disabled permits can park for free during the week.Heads up - the public bathroom in the main parking area had a sink but no soap dispenser or any way to dry your hands. I now know why the paint is worn away above the toilet's flush handle: people use their foot to flush because people know they can't wash their hands!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnAnotherJourney

50,Easy hike - breathtaking views!,Took an easy hike from beach to lookout area. Incredible views!! We have three kids and they didn't complain about the hike. There are areas close to the edge of the cliff that require careful steps. There is a rope along this area - but it still made me a little nervous. All in all a great family activity!! We even saw a whale migration from the beach while we were there (April).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatStam

50,"Ocean, beach, cliffs, views, hiking","We approached Point Dume from Westward Beach. The high cliff is a popular climbing spot and several climbers were on its face. At the same time, a photo shoot was going on with a wedding couple and a white horse. This area is also featured in many films and commercials for its scenic beauty. A trail leads up from the beach and you wind around the seaward side of the hills until you top out hundreds of feet above the beach. Hold your hat, as the winds are fierce on top. There are close up views of ocean, beaches, rocks, surf, cliffs, pickle weed and brush covered hills, and beautiful cliff top houses. The long views up and down the Malibu coastline are amazing as well. The trails are well maintained. Hiking was easy even in sandals. It's definitely not a wilderness experience, but Point Dume's popularity doesn't spoil the experience. There are knowing looks from strangers as you each recognize that you are sharing a great day outside in the sea air.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MerrillC_12
40,A great experience - be prepared to climb a bit or you will miss an incredible view !,"The cliffs along the beach are a must - short hike. Don't wear flip flops - the sand near the top is deep and you will lose your footing.The top has an incredible view both up and down the beach.There were climbers on the face were fun to watch,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cfsdir

40,"Great view, beautiful spot, but small","Your best bet: park in the paid lot at the end of Westward Beach (or at valet at The Sunset Restaurant). Walk all the way to the end of the beach then up the trail to headlands park. From there, walk back to Cliffside Drive then walk along the roadside all the way back down to The Sunset. Makes for a nicer hike and a bit more of a workout.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Newsdoc
50,Wonderful views easily reached,"I am so happy that we stopped at this spot on our recent trip. The parking situation was challenging as there are no signs. There is a small area that fits around a dozen cars right near the paths, and there are no signs indicating where else you can park. But it was so worth the effort. We walked up to the top of the cliff. Really easy walk and the views you get at the top are spectacular. We then walked down to the beach and were treated with high surf crashing on the beach and cliffs and surfers taking advantage. Because the surf was so high, there wasn't much sand right at the bottom of the path. But you could sit on the rocks and enjoy the view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/883gailg
50,"Get away from the ""touristy"" beaches and enjoy more secluded beach...","This is perhaps one of the most beautiful and enjoyable beaches along the southern California coast!! Forget Santa Monica, Venice or Malibu...drive a little farther north and you will fall in love with this beach! Point Dume is not crowded and you can always have your own spot to enjoy the beach. Lifeguards are always present and you can even watch surfers catch some good waves. Bring your own icechest full of food and enjoy a day or afternoon at Point Dume! You will not be disappointed.

50,Private Beach,This felt like a private beach! We paid $8 for parking and there was only a handful of people. We were able to hop into the water without worrying about our bags. They had a couple of small production movies going on but was not busy at all! Views were absolutely beautiful! Cannot wait to go back there!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsrmoore
40,Well Worthy,"This place is beautiful, simple! It has a great view from the top, the cliff is easily accessible and the nature is really great! Moreover, nice houses around and a great beach walk if you want to have a morning run, for example. I went by bus, it is kinda hard. The road is very far from the point, so what I did was I stopped in the last bus stop of Malibu Bus (that I do not remember the number, but the one from Sta Monica).T hen I walked all the way from the beach until the cliff. It is well worthy, but it took me 1h!! You can get out of the bus in a closer bus stop, where you walk 30 min (use google maps). But to go back it is a hard walk if you go through the houses, specially at night 'cause there is no lights on the street, maybe it's better from the beach. (I got a ride, lucky me).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EstelaAltoe
50,Incredible!,The view off the cliff is just outstanding! The parking lot is definitely limited but if you don't mind a 10 minute walk there was parking along the street. The view was definitely worth the walk!We also ventured down to Zuma beach which has parking all along the sides of the road. It was a nice beach and we had a great day!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshB3904
50,Best spot,"Everyone flocks to Zuma, but I prefer Point Dume any day of the week. It's not as busy, feels more secluded, and backs up against the cliff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MalibuMomma
50,Great view of the coast...,"Our favorite go to beach that's less than an hour from Los Angeles by far! We went to Zuma beach last year, a stone's throw away from Point Dume. But, this place is better, a bit secluded and the most fun part is you get to do a quick walk through a trail going up to the peak were you can see the coastline. What an awesome view indeed! Too bad we did not see any dolphins as some reviewers have luckily seen. Come early before it gets crowded. Waves can also be high depending on the weather. There are two sets of restrooms located at both ends of the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tameia
40,Point dume beach. Malibu,Point dume beach is a beautiful beach but right now there are tons of rocks all over the beach because waves have washed away the sand. Quite difficult to walk on too. Not alot of beach sand right now. So many other beautiful beaches in Malibu to go play in the sand. Also the stairs going down to the beach are in need of repair and I read recently in the paper the stairs are going to be removed and replaced in the near future.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/268se
40,Great Place to Get a Tan and Surf,"This beach has a wide sand area with plenty of space, is rarely crowded, and has some decent waves. If you like to surf you will enjoy the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SirTravelLover
50,California trip,Awesome and absolutely beautiful!!! Highly recommend seeing!! The view from the bluffs were unforgettable! Climbing the rocks was fun as well!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimberlyp761
50,God's creation,"Go with a local, that knows how to get there. Kinda off the beach road and only 10 places to park. No other places to park along the road. Our friend dropped us off and we spent 45 min walking down to the rocky coastline then up to the point. Awesomeness at all points. Views of God's wonders, with the varied plant life and rocks and ocean. Nice cool breezes at the water's edge and when you get to the top...so bring a jacket .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/runnergirl080
50,Stunning!,"If you drive through Malibu on Route 1 and not stop here, you'll really miss how beautiful Malibu is. We had a great hike over the hills and down to the beach. It was absolutely stunning",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Euell
50,One of The West Coasts Most Iconic Natural Landmarks,"Point Dume juts out at the northern end of Santa Monica Bay as a unique natural landmark like no other.It is a small world by itself. Below is the isolated Pirate's Cove, long a nude beach.It is a challenging climb up the rocks and paths from the south end of Zuma Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L5112CDrichards
50,Perfection,"If you have a sunny afternoon or evening to spare (which is easy to come by while in Southern California), this is a great spot. This is an amazing spot in Malibu. We stopped by here on a Friday afternoon and parked in the lot on the beach, which had plenty of open spots. We walked up the path a bit to Point Dume, which was an easy walk that is worth it with non-stop views all the way. The summit gives you a wide view north and south up and down the coast. We walked back down and sat on a quiet spot along the beach for a couple of hours. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to observe and see in person the amazing Southern California coast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shawnk538
40,Classic California Beach Walking,"Point Dume is a quiet ""get away"" spot to experience the beach scene - to walk on the sand & to hopefully see a pod of dolphins swimming off the coast. Fairly rustic with minimal amenities. Bring a picnic basket & enjoy it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
30,Pathetic,"This place has has the Republican Blues, i.e., when you hate government, you get State Natural Preserves like this. The fences are rusted and fallen, people are deviating from estabilished trails, making new trails, and producing some nasty erosion features. It is just a worn, heavily used preserve with little evidence of rational stewardship and lots of loose trash. On the positive side, there seem to be fewer invasive, alien elements of the flora than evident on prior visits and - lets face it - it's wonderful that a tiny patch of native vegetation can be set aside in the Malibu area. But, if the State does not deal with obvious usage problems, it might as well be Point Doomed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HughDanielWilson
50,Secret Beach,"If you like to adventure Dume Beach should be your next stop. Upon walking along the shore line to our destination we saw 50+ Dolphins playfully swimming, jumping, surfing the waves at the beach, literally 5 feet from us. Once we got the end of the beach we hiked over the rock wall which exposes a beautiful horseshoe shaped hidden beach. Additionaly hiking over the other side was a beautiful by the ocean walk along rocks (not for the faint of heart) as the rocks are quite steep in some spots. Ending our hike on a rock ledge filled with hundreds of seals sunbathing. It was a great day and experience. My only complaint is the parking fees, just too much money..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CGualano
50,Foggy Day but No Disappointments,"When we thought the drizzling rain and fog had squelched any chances of seeing a whale or anything of interest, we were about to turn back. However, then we saw a small pod of about 4-5 dolphins swimming parallel to the shore. We watched them for a while. When we walked along to another lookout area, we heard the sea lions before we saw them. They were at the base of the cliff we were on so they weren't easy to see without binoculars, but they were still fun to see and watch from a distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeslieinTN
40,Scenic views,"Hard to get parking but beautiful, panoramic views.Not sure that the 30 minute drive in traffic was worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmathew22
30,Beautiful beach; shame about tar from the Santa Barbara oil spill,"Beautiful beach. Parking is difficult as there are only about 6 free parking spaces designated for this beach and they are limited to 2 hours. If they are taken you need to park at Zuma or Westward ($3-$10 depending on the day) and walk here.Unfortunately due to the recent oil spill in Santa Barbara there is currently a problem with tar on the beach. You could be lucky and avoid it, or be less fortunate as we were and discover that you or one of your kids gets it stuck on their feet or clothes. It's hard to spot until it's too late. Hopefully the situation will be remedied soon and it'll be back to normal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Naturelover99
40,Great Place to Visit,We spent a wonderful afternoon hiking around and enjoying this special place. Well worth the time and effort to get here. The drive up the coast from LA and then back through the mountains makes for a wonderful day. Very highly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColoradoDoc
40,Amazing view over the cliffs!,"Mandatory visit for people who likes taking photos or just enjoy the viewing and relax a little bit. There is a stairway available, so you can access the beach in the base of the cliffs, but you will need legs to come up again. Unfortunately, at least when I visited, the place was in need of a little bit more care. There is only a small parking lot available (4 or 5 regular vehicles, and more 2 for handicap), so you better stop the car some blocks behind the main street (be sure to stop in a permitted zone, police is always checking the place, and the chance of being fined is high).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BGama
50,Great Hike and Beautiful Beach!,"My boyfriend and I love visiting Malibu, especially Point Dume Beach! It's not as crowded as the other LA beaches.The part I love the most is the little hike up to the top. Great views of the beach and towering cliffs! If you keep walking, you'll see a little area where you can sit and watch seals and sometimes whales! The total hike is probably 1/2 of a mile one way.Tip: it's usually pretty windy up there!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/c00kyc
40,SIte of many memorable movies and television shows.,"The rock formations here and the lack of houses on the top of the bluff make this an ideal spot for television and movie filming. The beach and rocky bluff area was used for the last scene in the original Planet of The Apes movie where Charleton Heston finds the remains of the Statue of LIberty. This was also the spot where the television show China Beach, with Dana Delany, filmed all their beach scenes. A relatively short but at times steep walk to the top gets you to a small concrete platform out on the edge of the bluff. This platform was put there by film crews for the purpose of having a stable and level platform for a camera. There are also a couple of anchor rings for safety ropes for the camera crews. At the top you can also see Pirate Cove which is a very secluded small section of beach in an indention in the bluff. Also used for lots of movie, television and photo shoots. The Cove looks to be very difficult to get to safely but we did see one young couple down there when we visited. This is also a nice beach area for spotting aquatic wildlife. Definitely worth a stop on your drive along the Pacific Coast Highway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coastermeister
50,"Whales, sea lions, great walk, views!","We stopped here to walk on Mother's Day. A gray whale and a younger whale were playing not far off of the shore. We were all mesmerized. We enjoyed the climbing trail up the Point. There were a few really steep points and sturdy shoes are recommended.For $8, this was an afternoon full of memories, fresh air and invigoration!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kpfraser19
40,Great beach area with views and hiking,"Our group were not the type to sit on a beach and soak in the sun. The hike up the bluff, the views, and the the hike along the coastline were excellent. When done, we did relax on the beach, people and water watching. It made for a greater and relaxing 1/2 day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mitchelllafrance
40,Great view,Great view for some panoramic photos. It was worth the detour to Malibu. The hike up is pretty steep so this is not for kids,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/olgaeisenman
50,My Pt. Dume,"My visit to Pt. Dume was the highlight of my recent LA trip. Having raised my kids in Pt.Dume, and having coordinated the volunteers who religiously joined me every Sunday for 6 years in removing the invasive ice plant that took over all the natives, so that the native correopsis could come back and thrive, I have a special place in my heart for this magical piece of land. It brought tears to my eyes to see how all those efforts have paid off. Walking the trails we planned so long ago, so that people could walk safely where they wanted to go, having benches to sit on and lookouts to enjoy viewing the sea lions, dolphins and whales...touched my heart so deeply. I felt a surge of pride fill me top to bottom as I was surrounded by thousands and thousands of correopsis, way taller than me. Hard to believe you could have counted those plants on two hands when we started. I couldn't believe it. There were botanists taking photos of what most of us would think was just dirt...but they saw a rare and teeny red flowering plant and needed to record it. So many people, young and old, were walking the trails and oohing and aahing. I left there with a renewed sense of accomplishment and pride, knowing I have left at least a small legacy and have made a difference somewhere in the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MilkmaidTS
40,Nature,"Wonderful beach, you don't feel the crowd. Sea lions, pelicans, albatross ...we found that it's better to patk in the park lot then outside ... Much easier & less.crowded then outside",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rutis10
50,Beautiful beach,"this is an amazing place, my daughter got married on the top at point fume and we couldn't of asked for a better location or day. The weather was glorious, and we had a golden eagle watching over us the whole time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monkey2009Cheshire
50,Beautiful Beach and Hiking with a fantastic view,We visited this State Beach on a beautiful sunny day and hiked the peak that overlooks the ocean. The hike was really fun with great paths and a lookout at the halfway point. There is some free parking but the paid parking is worth it. I think it was only $8.00 and you can get close to the trails and the beach. The restrooms are as bad as you would expect at a state park facility. There was a wedding taking place on the beach there and lots of nice beach for families too. Put this on your list next time you are in Malibu.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShellyM350
50,Breathtaking place for a walk,"We drive to Zuma beach, took the hiking trail up and around. About 2 miles. Beautiful views. Some people were even rock climbing. Saw little kids walking the trail. Ocean down below and as far as you could see. Restrooms. Parking $8 or you could walk further and find street parking. I recommend for a beautiful walk along the shore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/538pamelas
50,MUST SEE!!,"I cannot possibly say enough positive things about this amazingly gorgeous place. I don't even know where to start.The beach is gigantic so it never feels crowded. There are rocks to climb and trails to walk and so much to see. Lots of wildlife...I have always seen either whales or seals. There is even serious rock climbing for those who have the proper equipment.On the weekends you have to pay for parking (only if you want to get super close to the trail down by the beach) but you can park along the beach for free and then walk to the trail...long walk but worth it. During the week on off-season, parking is free. There is a restaurant right on the corner where the booth is to pay for parking (during those times you have to actually pay for parking and it's only like $7 or so). I have not eaten at that restaurant yet but when I do, I will write a review. It seems to always be busy so that's saying something at least :)If you're an adventure lover or simply a person who loves to relax and chillax on the beach, this place is for you.Have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Orangutanlover
50,Gods Perfection,"My husband and I visited here the last week of February, 2015. Since it was off season we basically had the place to ourselves. The only other people really at the beach were like us, just there to take in the beauty of the place. There were other photographers there catching the beautiful waves and the scenic rocky outcropping.I highly recommend going during off season so that you can experience the quiet serene beauty of this magnificent place.The fee involved is just for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/camrachic
50,Excellent small getaway!,This little state beach and preserve is a hidden gem near Malibu. It is a great place for photographers to capture the blooming flowers near April/May time and to get that beautiful open view over the beach and ocean. Make sure you bring a jacket if you plan on going to the top cliff area because it is super windy and can get really cold. It is also a great place for whale watching and enjoy a picnic at the beach. Did I mention it is one of the best places to view a sunset?I didn't go down to the beach area as I was there primarily for the sunset view over the cliff. This area is such a nicely secluded beautiful beach; much better than santa monica beach. There is also a private beach area on the left that has a very steep climp. Would not recommend if you are not experienced and you are not wearing proper climbing shoes. I saw a few people almost fall that day. There is also very limited parking (not the beach area) and no restrooms. Overall a very pleasant experience!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sevani2013
50,Always a good time.,"Not the most challenging of climbing locations, but the rock face offers a good spot to train and bring beginners. Fairly easy approach to set top-ropes and anchors, just watch for erosion and weak spots (sandstone).Great spot for picnics. Beach is clean.Not an infrequent occurrence to run into a film crew as this is a popular spot to film anything from commercials, tv spots and movies (had the pleasure of running into Jay and Silent Bob for the filming of the ""planet of the apes"" scene in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (totally just aged myself, but oh well, I thought it was cool).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/968heatherw
50,One of my favorite beaches,"We went down the long path down not sure what to expect and were so surprised to find such a secluded and beautiful beach. Loved the views from the top, but scamper across the rocks to the left when you make it down and you will be rewarded with a wonderful private beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericbL4533SD
40,Whale watching & Picnic day at the Beach,"I usually only go to beaches such as Venice or Santa Monica when giving friends from out-of-town the typical LA tour. But the nicer beaches require a little more driving. Recently I visited Point Dume, which is adjacent to Zuma Beach and is located north of Santa Monica passing through Malibu. There are several options for parking, but if you do not mind a short 10 - 15 minute hike up a small hill, then its best you pay for parking down at the southern-most parking area of Zuma Beach where you can also find clean bathrooms. The little hike makes the views even more rewarding, specially if you enjoy nature and wildlife viewing. You are likely to see whales in the distance from the top (look for the blows in the distance, good idea to bring binoculars). Weekend afternoons means bad traffic and less parking so I recommend weekend mornings or weekdays. There is a very nice supermarket (Vintage Grocers) and shopping area on the northern end of Zuma Beach which is a very long beach. Also a gas station at this location.Warning: Regarding the hiking trails around Point Dume it is important to be aware of some dangerous spots. There are a few areas where the trail comes very close to the edge of the cliff and the protection barrier is just a single wire and the ground is not firm. So please keep an eye on your children and be careful yourself. It is safe as long as you stay on the trail.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fonsoy
50,Awesome views!,"We visited on a Tuesday afternoon and had no problem parking down in the beach parking lot. It was $6, paid by credit card at the pay machine. We visited in the late afternoon and stayed to watch the sunset. There are some very easy/moderate trails that will take you on a leisurely 5-10 minute hike to the top of the point. The views of the ocean and up along the coast are incredible. We saw some sea lions resting on the rocks down by the water, and some were swimming nearby. It's a great spot for the kids to climb and hike and explore if they like the outdoors. We spent about 2 hours, which was just enough. If you're looking for a fun and inexpensive outdoor experience that allows you to take in all the beauty that Malibu has to offer, this is the perfect place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ERFSU82
20,No Parking,Don’t bother to go here unless you are willing to park several blocks away and walk to the site. There is only about ten parking spots and a line of cars waiting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K2075BPmichaelr
10,Parking trouble,"you loose your patience and energy waiting of a spot in a small parking lot that can accommodate 6 cars only, parking anywhere else is illegal and there is cop waiting to give a ticket in case you leave your car unattended. The beach itself is very nice, you get a good view of the sea, you can climb a bit on a peak for a better view. I could hardly enjoy after waiting for 45 mins for parking when it got darker.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/595pankajr
30,Looked Good but,No parking except for a short strip closeby. If you have time to park farther away close to PCH then may be worthwhile.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Polsixe
50,Beautiful Canyon Drive,"Went to Malibu for the day. Point Dume, Zuma all very nice but I unfortunately tend to judge beaches by Hawaiian standards and that's a high bar. But what was absolutely enchanting was driving through the canyons behind Malibu on my way toward the San Fernando Valley. We chose to take Kanan Dume Road which runs from Point Dume over the Santa Monica Mountains toward Agoura Hills and Thousand Oaks. Incredible! We passed huge, beautiful estates, sprawling vineyards, horse farms. So rustic and serene and wild, you'd never know you were in the middle of a city of 20 million. The hidden gems are usually found off the beaten track and exploring Southern California's innumerable canyons are a great place to start!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WaikikiJ
50,Loved,"We loved this beach....beautiful and clean. You can walk out to the point walking up the path, a little scary way up there but beautiful. We saw seals and dolphins. Just great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kayr86
50,Views are worth the drive,Beautiful area for hiking and views. Not good for sitting on the beach too many rocks. Bring good walking shoes!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deborah3302
50,Awesome views and hike,"We were visiting our kids over Thanksgiving and they took us to Point Dume. I would highly recommend the hike. It can be a little challenging crossing the rocks, but my 3 year old nephew did it with no problem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeH971
50,Stunning views,"Beautiful spot to visit, parking was pretty full, but not impossible. Enjoyed the hike and the seals basking on the shore were an added treat. Could peacefully enjoy the views even with the amount of people hiking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/868tinap
50,Pristine and quiet,"Loved the hiking trails and ability to get down to the beachDisliked lack of parking spaces (about 15 spots, max). Parking is sunrise to sunset. No dogs allowed---bad for the critters who make this preserve their home. A wonderful outing and can't wait to return again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaliforniaCaridee
40,Nice!,"Parking is $12.50, but worth it.Cause I went on a sunday. The free parking was full. Decided to pay, and close to shire parking lifeguards, restooms. Semi private place, cause if u don't pay the parking fee, u r in a much more crowded area. It takes u about 0.3 miles away from the crowds.The cliff is awesome!Waking on the actual point, is great!Many seals on the south side of the point.Many trails. The big rock gave am awesome view of Zuma beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oneeddy1

20,"Too much trash, literally",We went here based on the positive reviews on Trip Advisor but were very disappointed. Lots of trash on the beach and poor access. Parking limited to 2 hours and about 4 spaces. I guess it's the local's party spot judging by the remains of their fires and the dog mess they left behind.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samc627
50,stroll over to Pirates Cove!,"Been to Zuma/Point Dume few times and always love it, especially this time with my young son as before we left home we watched the original 1967 Planet of the Apes movie, and once we passed the rock wall where climbers scale and easily scramble around the point to the next tiny beach - Pirates Cove - and if you ever saw the end of that movie, this beach is where the finale of the movie takes place. The Statue of Liberty came out of the side of the far cliff with bird poop all over it and the rock wall behind the cliff where Charlton Heston had the gun battle with Dr.Zaius tied up. the cave to the Forbidden Zone is there but is not safe to ascend to at all. My son and I took many pictures we had fun setting up to mimic the movie.Con is that it is a bit dirty with garbage and broken glass.Parking is like $12+",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WelcomeMat

50,Wow!,Breathtaking views from this park. Lots of friendly surfers. Not much parking. There is a nearby street where you can leave your car. I enjoyed the walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suzcorner
40,Wonderful Vantage Point for All Things Coastal,"Bluff top preserve of coastal scrub, chaparral, and the like leading out to fantastic views of the Pacific. Only room for 11 cars (2 hr. parking) plus 2 handicap, so either come during a school week or park below along Westward Beach Road and hike up the traverse trail by Pirate's Cove. From the bluff you will have panoramic views north and south along the coastline. Sunsets are primo and with binoculars you can search the rocky pools below for harbor seals, sea lions, and dolphins. The area teems with birdlife and also looks down on the gray whale migrations. Trails meander throughout the bluffs and stairways lead down to both Pirates Cove and Dume Cove beaches. Pirates Cove sports a rock wall fancied by local climbers. Dume Cove is rocky but if you hike far enough north, you will get to good surf runs just short of Paradise Cove. Be careful of the high tide as you move around points. Best access from PCH going south is by Westward Beach Road left to Birdsview which becomes Cliffside and the bluff parking area. Driving north on the PCH, use Zumirez Dr. to Wildlife to Fernhill to Cliffside. There's actually a metro bus (534) but it has an awkward schedule and is set up for the wealthy commuters residing here. Someone asked if you walk in from the PCH. The answer is yes, about 30 minutes. If you make it a whole day this could be your plan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zoom_Gotti
50,Simply stunning,"Wow great view easy little stroll, could have looked up and down the coast for hours. We didn't walk down to the beach but looked stunning. Seriously worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J_and_R_AKL
40,Mesmerizing view of the Pacific from the Hill Top - The Point Dume,The Point Dume gives you a wonderful view of he pacific ocean from three sides. The Hill top is easy accesible not hard trekking. Even kids also can trace to the top.The hill top( nort exactly a hill although) extends into the ocean from the beach thus giving you are peninsular view of the Ocean ahead of you. The gusting sound of the veiws.. the wide open Blue ocean and soothing wind(high speed breeze). The veiw of the Zuma Beach on one side is an add on.Dont forget to look out for the plantonics just under the surface of the ocean giving a dark shade to the water here and there.If interested for surfing you can go for it here.But be careful and while going around the edge and avoid the edges. There is enough space to move around.Not much crowded. Quite and Serene Place.Car parking is a concern as it has limited parking space. Its just along the side of the road. But you can one although as it is worth visiting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LadyMarcopolo
50,Tremendous place to visit for sunset,"Point Dume may be one of the better places in Malibu to watch a sunset. Make sure to get there early as finding parking is difficult, so you may have to walk a bit. Bring something to sit on once you get to the top, and have some wine and cheese while you enjoy the setting sun! Enjoyed watching and listening to the sea lions swimming below us in the ocean as they searched for a fish meal!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/epi007
50,Great hiking area,"Went on a 6 mile, 2 hr, hike. It was GREAT! Loved every minute, views are great, trail is easy to follow, everyone we saw on the trail was friendly. Bring water as it is hot and dry but you will love it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rayzorboy
50,Bring your walking shoes and swimsuit,"This was a really cool place. Though parking was a bit expensive ($12) it was worth it. The beach was a lot less crowded and the waves were pretty and nice and big. There was a lot less kelp washed up than in other locations along the coast and it was very well kept beach. There was a TV show being filmed there the day we were there too which was kinda cool. Apparently that's not terribly rare. I would recommend also bringing your walking shoes and hiking up Point Dume Volcano. It has the best view, and is worth the little extra hike but it wasn't a fun hike in flipflops!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelissaM955
50,Beautiful views,"There is a beautiful, easy hike up Point Dume right above the ocean. The views are amazing all along the trail. We often see sea lions and dolphins. We went mid June this year and saw many baby sea lions on the rocks below in the cove. The beach is great to walk too. There are rocks and cliffs, and a neat cove. They do have a parking fee close to the trailhead and beach, or you can park a little out on the street and walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripjini

40,Great place to visit in Malibu,"I was born and raised in Santa Monica and kept my horse at Point Dume. Back in the 1960's it was just a park and beach, but they have made it more than that now. When I was driving out there, it didn't even have a signal where you enter. I was just out there for my 50th High School reunion and had to go back to visit my Point Dume again........",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TucsonGrammy

50,Great Beach,"We were visiting Malibu for the first time, and were going to Zuma beach, and the parking attendant told us to try Point Dume, we lucked up on parking, it is a very busy place. The beach was great, got to see lots of surfers. Saw dolphins jumping around, the tall cliffs were neat too!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAROLL942
50,A little slice of paradise right here,"I typically make this a required stop enroute to Ventura from LA. I park in the neighborhood [includes gorgeous homes which I understand are owned by a number of successful Hollywood celebrities] at the top of the cliff where there is a sign designating the location as Point Dume State Beach. As others have mentioned there are a limited number of parking spaces [10-11, I believe] so luck may have to be with you if the surf is up! There are steep steps leading down the cliff to the beach + 2 trails leading to the very top of the cliff. Wear sturdy shoes as the trail leading to the top will turn to deep loose sand which can be a challenge. Of course bring your camera to record some awesome views! No facilities [food, water, bathrooms] so prepare accordingly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/46Lil
40,Beautiful Beach - Please read,"We had a really nice time 4/26/14. The beach is very nice. There were some dolphins & sea lions sightings there that day. Also, they were also filming a show that day. But the most memorable thing I seen that day was, a man falling 40-50 feet off a cliff & getting air rescued out. The rescuers did a GREAT job! I think about the guy everyday. I hope he is alright. So PLEASE be safe on the rocks / cliffs or you might NOT be as lucky. BE SAFE.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackieHandt
40,Hiking by the ocean,"There are not too many places where you can go hiking right by the Ocean. Point Dume is one of them and that is well worth doing it. The Beach itself is not the best in Southern California, it is kind of primitive, I would say never cleaned by the City. The water is very rough and the undercurrents strong.Unless you simply prefer less people sharing the beach with you, this place does not have any appeal.But the hike to Point Dume cliffs is different. If you usually go hiking in the hot and dusty Sierra mountains, you will enjoy the refreshing ocean breeze while climbing to the top of the cliffs.Bring water with you and rest a few minutes on the benches at the top of the cliffs. From here you will have an excellent panoramic view of the ocean and the beach. Lots of times you can see dolphins and sea lions and sometimes even the tail of a whale. That is a well deserved reward!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LATraveller_12
50,Most gorgeous beach in Malibu,"Who would have thought there was such a treasure in Malibu. Truly a highlight of our two-week trip to CA. Point Dume is well hidden in a residential neighborhood, so be sure to follow some directions or you will never find it. There are a few free parking spaces and people actually queue up and wait for folks to leave. Several great hiking trails. Be sure to hike to the top and take in the view. If you look to the left you will see a beautiful crescent shaped beach, which was pretty empty when we arrived, because it’s not that easy to reach. If you look to the right, you will see neighboring Zuma Beach. You can easily spend hours here just walking around. Keep in mind that there are no facilities at Point Dume.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lost175lbs

50,"Perfect hike, great scenery and a baby sea lion!","This was one of the highlights of our trip. We paid for parking way at the end of the parking lot and hiked up to the top and over to see the tidepools which weren't much, but we still discovered some small hermit crabs. As we were turning to go back we noticed a baby sea lion on the beach so we stood and watched him for a long time until a surfer scared it out into the ocean to join its family. He was so adorable! We headed back over the overlook and spent time on walking up and down the beach and making a sandcastle. The coastline was just beautiful. And one final tip, put suntan lotion on your feet if you're wearing flip flops. I always forget about the reflection from the water and how much that adds to your sunburn.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LounBee
50,Amazing view and the hike is fun too,"his is the first thing my son loves to do when we come to Malibu. So we have done it way to many times.

50,Easy hiking on the Pacific coast,"We visited Point Dume Nature Preserve the first week in January, 2014. We enjoyed a couple of hours of easy hiking on the trails and beach. The highest point offered beautiful views of the Pacific Ocean and Malibu coastline. The trails were clean and well-kept. There are only a handful of parking spots so we had to find some street parking in the neighborhood surrounding the park.

Alternatively you can look for one of the 7 parking spots at the top and walk over to the point - but... the easiest is to pay at the gate (or at the machine if no-one is working warning: parking is enforced).

50,Best beach in Malibu,"We found Point Dume beach this year on a trip to California. In an attempt to escape the 40+ degree heat in Los Angeles, we headed for Malibu and discovered this gem of a beach. Parking was ample and not overly expensive, approx. 10 US Dollars for the day. The beach itself had soft white sand and was fairly empty. It was great to finally be able to swim, as up to then the risk of shark attack had put me off! the breakers were huge, but exhilarating and my son enjoyed making sandcastles and tunnels in the sand. there was even a wedding taking place a little way down the beach! Truly great place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janes240

50,Don't miss the Planet of the Apes beach!,"My husband and I were looking for a beautiful Malibu beach to power walk on and came upon a review of Pointe Dume. It was a no brainer when we read that the classic scene in the Planet of the Apes was filmed here - Charlton Heston walking and seeing part of the Statue of Liberty jutting out of the sand! So we knew there would be a huge rock and gorgeous beach. We had not idea that there would be a walking trail with spectacular views of the Pacific. There was a wooden viewing area at the very top where you can sit, take incredible photos and hear sea lions barking. You could also take a slightly treacherous rusty staircase to a rocky shore on the other side (would skip that), but DO NOT miss Pointe Dume. Will definitely return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichL
50,Iconic Planet of the Apes Film Site,"GETTING THERE: Take PCH to Malibu, driving 19 miles northwest of the end of the 10 Freeway in Santa Monica. Turn left (south) at the light on Heathercliff Road. Make the first left on Dume Drive and go one mile to Sea Lion Place. Turn right and drive to the end of the street. Make a left on Birdview Avenue, which curves to the left behind the park and becomes Cliffside Drive. Just after the curve, park in the small 2-hour parking area on the right. The trail begins from the parking area.PARKING FEE: If you go early enough, the above mentioned parking area will have spots available and it is free. There are only a few spots available. Otherwise you will have to go to the actual beach, which has a fee. I've heard it's around $8. DO NOT park on the road, fines are steep, and not worth the price.TRAIL: Take the trail from the parking lot on Cliffside, follow it to the right and head down to the beach. Amazing views.--This is a vast beach, lot's of sand and water. Bathrooms are available, there was no soap, so bring hand sanitizer. Lot's of people surfing, and we spotted a group of dolphins.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeksTravel

50,Don't miss the preserve!,"Point Dume Beach is lovely and I also recommend paying the $8 for parking to be close to the quieter end of the beach. Be sure to save a lot of time to spend walking up to the preserve area. There is a walking trail and incredible views of the Pacific. There are often sea lions on the rocks jutting out of the ocean and dolphins are common visitors. I've had friends see whales from the preserve, but I haven't seen any yet. I'll keep coming back, though! There is a questionable wooden staircase that leads down to the beach on the other side. Be careful there!

There are several lifeguard stations keeping watch until about 5pm. After that, you are on your own in the cold water. Best part is the volcanic rock cliff and a rugged hiking trail to the top. For the more adventurous, it is possible to crawl over fallen rocks to a second secluded beach.

50,"Enjoy the sunsets, sand and seashore","This is a relatively small beach compared to Zuma and others; however, it has the rock climbing that attracts some adventurous types. There is a hiking trail and some avoid the State Park fee by hiking over the hill to the each. It surprises me that the parking fees are such a big deal to the California environmental crowd. I would think they would want to support the state park system. The bathrooms are clean and suitable for children. The waves are not as strong as other beaches and the sandy beach is comfortable. You can climb the hill an watch a beautiful sunset.

50,Fantastic Tide pools,The best tide pools I have seen since Oregon. It was really confusing to get to them however- and that is the only reason we went. You have to park way at the end. And then pay the parking meter. I had researched online- there were many different prices from different people. I was expecting a State Park booth to pay. Minimum was $8. We had to climb up mountain to go back down to the other side to go to the tidepools.

50,My favorite SoCal beach,"This is *the best beach* in Southern California. Period. Well-maintained, parking lot, lifeguards, restrooms (cause the kiddies and I can't hold it), pretty places to sunbathe and hike; I just can't find anything wrong, except on a day that I can't find parking. Just fork over the $10 for parking and you'll make everyone's time at Point Dume a lot easier. I'd say this beach is just as good for kids as any in Malibu; the surf here is no rougher than most popular beaches in the area; my kids love it and I do not feel uneasy at all bringing them. Okay, there is sometimes the occasional smell of something that reminds me of my days at CalArts, but nothing terribly objectionable. The crowd is a nice combination of folks. You can hike up the trail towards the iconic cliff and experience one of the loveliest vistas on the Southern California coast. Go off trail and you'll enjoy the view from the precipice of the cliff: perfection. You stand on the top and look straight out at the setting sun, with the sound of the waves crashing below, and you feel closer to your creator. This is the stuff memories are made of.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrittanyB883

From the parking lot ($10) you can access the beach or head up the hiking trails. Trails will take you around a point that has a look out with wonderful views and if you sit there long enough you can see dolphins & sea lions playing very close to shore. I imagine at the right time of year it would also be a great place to look for whale blows. Some seabirds also abundant especially pelicans and cormorants. The dunes are full of succulents and a few lizards.The trails also take you to the other side of Point Dume where there was a very uncrowded beach along Dume Cove that you could hike down to, looks like some great kayaking could be had. If I come back I will definitely spend time on that uncrowded jewel.

It's also not very well lit at night. So plan your exodus well.Parking is $8 during the day on weekends, but if you go at 4pm or later, you can pay $3. Perfect plan for a sunset timing.

A people watching mecca.I prefer a more secluded beach to relax upon. If you're with me, then read on.My favorite is Point Dume State Beach and the eastern face of that peninsula. You can reach it by taking the PCH to Heathercliff Rd (turn left at the light) and then make a left on Dume Dr (about 3 blocks off of PCH).This location is near Malibu and east of Hwy 23 and west of Hwy 27. Kanan-Dume Rd from Hwy 101 drops you right onto PCH and very close (1/4 mile) from the Heathercliff Rd exit to the north/west.Stay on Dume Dr until it dead ends into Cliffisde Dr and turn right. About 150 feet you'll find an area to park and a trailhead down to the beach. Here's the catch, you only have about 6 car spaces. Don't try the shoulder of the road or expect a $50 parking fine.This beach has beautiful cliffs, very few visitors, clean water, and a sufficient surf to bring out some surfers. Quiet, beautiful, secluded, safe for a close in swim, and it's a sure winner.The walk to the beach is about 10 minutes but it's a clear path with stairs to the beach. You'll walk over a rock/boulder field at the beach but suitable for anyone with good health including children.There are no lifeguards or bathroom facilities so a stop at the Pavillions Grocery Store (Heathercliff @ Dume Rd) is a good idea. They have awesome made to order sandwiches for $5.50 and top ingredients are used. A must stop before the beach.If there are no parking spaces available, then you have to make a choice:1. Accept the $50 parking ticket and pull into the dirt shoulder on the road. OR2. Continue down Cliffside Dr which becomes Birdview Ave to Westward Beach Rd (Left) to the fee station $7 fee and well worth it f you don't want to walk about 1 mile.3. Continue to circle through the lot until a space opens (local surfers do this). Must be patient.POINT DUME STATE BEACH (West facing of the peninsula)This assumes you have gone to the Westward Beach Rd access and after the fee station have driven all the way to the very end of the parking lot.You'll note a very high cliff face with huge size boulders at its base ending in the water. A very dramatic backdrop to your beach stay. Pull out those Pavillion made sandwiches and enjoy a great day.Interested in more seclusion? Climb over the boulders and you'll be into one of the most beautiful beach coves on the coast. This can be a bit dangerous so size up your abilities before attempting it.A second approach is to follow the path at the back of the sand beach up to the top of the cliff and then scale down the cliff into this beach cove. Not for the faint of heart so size it up before attempting.To see dolphins, continue on the path at the top of the cliff to the point nearest the ocean and be seated on the small concrete slab and feel the cool breeze and then watch for the dolphins. A very special place.Remember that temperatures at the beach even in August average around 76 degrees fahrenheit with a pretty strong breeze. Bring a light jacket as you can begin to feel chilled.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimbobwe
50,Awsome place!,"I love Point Dume. I would suggest this spot for anyone, all ages. High points of visiting, tide pools, whale watching, and hiking. The hike is not difficult at all, if you are not an avid hiker. It has a paved, well maintained walkway which takes you to the peak of the cliff for a view of the channel Islands.You can also stay at the base of the cliff, on the beach. It is just as beautiful. I have added some photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PRINCESSJEWLS20
