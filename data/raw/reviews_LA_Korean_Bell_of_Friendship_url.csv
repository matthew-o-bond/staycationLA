40,To celebrate our oneness,"The Korean Bell of Friendship is located in San Pedro. It is set on a knoll in Angels Gate Park overlooking the Pacific that offers magnificent views of Los Angeles harbour, the sea terraces of San Pedro hill and the Catalina Channel.This bell and the Korean style pavilion in which it is housed were donated in 1976 to the American people by the people of the Republic of Korea to commemorate the bicentennial of US Independence, to celebrate and further the long friendship between the two countries. The bell was declared a Los Angeles Historic Monument in 1978.The bell is made of an alloy of tin, copper, gold, silver and phosphorus. With a circumference of 7.25 metres and a height of 3.63 metres, it weighs in at a massive seventeen metric tonnes!The bell does not have a clapper – it is sounded by striking it from the outside with a large wooden log that hangs right next to it. The outer surface of the bell sports four pairs of goddesses symbolizing the spirits of freedom, independence, peace and prosperity in both countries.The intricately designed bell pavilion was built on site by Korean craftsmen over a span of ten months. It is built in traditional Korean architectural style with a blue tiled roof supported by gorgeously carved, green, pink and blue coloured beams. The roof is held up by twelve columns that represent the Korean zodiac with each column guarded by an animal carved in stone.The Friendship Bell is struck five times a year – on New Year Eve, Korean American Day (January 13), US Independence Day (July 4), Korean Liberation Day (August 15) and Constitution Day (September 17).Its sublime location and the sentiments it symbolizes mark the Korean Bell of Friendship as a tribute to humanity at large – it underscores that as humankind, we can rise above and beyond the narrow confines of geography, creed, religion, language, indeed everything that separates us – and come together to celebrate our oneness just the way John Lennon visualized in “Imagine”...",TMenon
30,Doesn't Really Ring My Bell,"If you happen to be in San Pedro because you're doing other activities (like a harbor cruise) then sure, stop by. I guess. If you're close. This bell is in a handful of movies. But, it's in a fairly ""uncelebrated"" if not uninteresting corner of town--the top of a lonely, mostly-dead-grass-thanks-to-the-drought hill.) It's just ""one of those monuments"" that mostly no one has ever heard of. Meh.",William Mark L

50,Breathtaking View.,"We stumbled upon the Korean Bell of Friendship after parking on our way to a local beach. We didn't know what to expect, however, when we got up to the bell, it was stunning. The area overlooks a cliff on the ocean and you can see literally, for miles. The whole area is calm, relaxing, full of life and friends, families, and people enjoying the grass, playground, and scenery.

There is a basketball court there which looks like a nice place to shoot hoops, if one is so inclined.",GBaller
40,Good to visit if you happen to be in the area,"The Area is very beautiful. Right on top of a hill overlooking the ocean. This area does have a bit of history. I won't mention it. But it is worth looking into ;)The location of this bell is amazing; it affords an unsurpassed view of the LA harbor, the Catalina Channel and the sea terraces of San Pedro hill, where the U.S. troops sailed into the Pacific. However, it is not worth it just to see this bell, as there is really nothing to do besides the view. However, if you are in the area, it is worth a visit and will not be a waste of time.",fr0stiex

40,Nice Monument,Came here on a warm and sunny Sunday morning. The bell is genuinely large and sheltered under an Asian style pergola in an exposed position overlooking the ocean and Long Beach Harbour. Surrounded by well kept grass used by families and kite flyers. Easy to park both in the little park and out in the street. My bird loving partner noticed a sea eagle using the top of the structure as a lookout and also some tiny humming birds in the shrubs around the bottom. It is all very nicely looked after but if you are interested in its history it is best to research before you come as there is no explanation on site.,JRNSydney_Australia

50,Beautiful Bell of Friendship,"Way at the end of Gaffey St, almost at the end of the world from one perspective, is the beautiful Korean Bell of Friendship, a gift of the Republic of South Pacific in 1976. It overlooks the Pacific Ocean with a vista that stretches forever. The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, Catalina, and the waters stretch on. The grounds are on the former Upper Reservation of Fort MacArthur (named for Douglas' dad) with plenty of flat land for picnics, a basketball court, and the beautiful pavilion housing the bell. Kite flying is very popular as the winds rise from the Pacific up the hill to the bell. Very tranquil and friendly.",Mark L
50,Let's fly a kite! Great history and beautiful ocean view,"This is definitely a location to visit for history buffs, but if you aren't, don't miss out! The views of the ocean (and Catalina Island) are unobstructed. Further, it is on top of the hill with a nice consistent breeze so a great location to be outside when its hot and/or fly a kite. I found multiple people participating in such activity while there and remember doing it as a child. It actually made me miss such a simple activity....now off to buy a kite!",Evelyn S

At least there was free parking. View of the ocean was nice, too. There is a small children's play area near the bell.

The views are just as beautiful as I remember..we were even able to see Catalina off in the distance. The bell itself is such a beauty to behold with its vibrant colors and the history it represents. Parking is free so thats a big plus in itself. If you ever visit the San Pedro, Palos Verdes area of Southern California, make sure that this is one of your places to visit. You wont be disappointed!",VictoriaAllen

It was kind of nice to get pictures of something so cool, without a bunch of people in the shots that you don't know. The site as well as the bell were really neat. The real treasure was next door at Fort McArthur. That was a good find so close.",Conrad68
40,Freedom Bell from Korea ...,"When down in Long Beach, or even Palos Verdes, it's worthwhile to make a visit to the remarkable Korean Bell of Friendship near Ft. McArthur (which you should also visit, but it's open 12pm-4pm only Tues-Thurs-Sat, check Google). The Korean bell pagoda is beautiful and is quite picturesque. Great views of the LA Harbor across the way, ...",David B L
50,Scenic Views and Symbol of Friendship - Korean Bell of Friendship,"We were staying in San Pedro We took a drive to Rancho Palos Verdes and as part of our explorations stopped to see the Korean Bell of Friendship.It is a massive bronze bell given by the Republic of Korea to the American people to celebrate the bicentennial of the United States. It was dedicated on October 3, 1976.The bell is rung five times a year: on New Year's Eve, Korean American Day (January 13), the Fourth of July, Korean Liberation Day (August 15), and Constitution Day (September 17).The bell is in Angel's Gate Park. The part of the park the bell is located in is called Korean-American Peace Park.From the bell's location, we also like the splendid views of the Pacific Ocean and also of the port area.",mini
50,Fabulous View of the Port and the Beach,Great place to go to in the evening. It offers great views of the LA port on one side with its massive cranes and what not. On the other side is the majestic Pacific Ocean itself. Anything to better this? Yes the lovely freedom bell temple itself and the sprawling lawns.We went there for the blood lunar eclipse and it was indeed very nice. We had to leave early as it was getting cold and we were not properly attired.,Bharat I
30,Worth seeing - but only if you are already nearby.,"On the way back from Long Beach to Torrance, took a short detour through San Pedro to take in the Friendship Bell.Interesting pagoda style building & the bell itself is massive.On the site of an old Gun Emplacement strategically placed to defend Long Beach Port.Great views out to the offshore islands.",BobandJosie
40,Long drive to get to the Bell.,The Korean Bell is a nice place to see. It is down in San Pedro near the Port of L.A. A nice place to visit when you have nothing to do.,Denis Z
50,Secluded hidden gem,"Even most local angelinos have never been here, but it's a hidden gem. The park grounds are very well kept, with lots of colorful flowers and green grass; the view of the ocean is unsurpassed; and the cool breeze makes this spot an excellent choice to spend a quality relaxing time at this park. Nearby, the Fort MacArhtur museum is at walking distance, so you can make the most out of your trip.",trekkerFrank
50,Relax !,"Visiting the Korean Bell of Friendship is highly recommended, plenty of parking, the park has a basketball court, and expansive grassy areas to sit and enjoy a picnic. Beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean, very relaxing, bring your kites !",M R
40,Friendship bell,Nice place to visit. Quiet and tranquil. The park has great views of the ocean. Nice place to relax or have a picnic. Or just a beautiful place to spend time.,5travelmom3
50,Hidden Gem that's often missed,"Out of all our friends and family that have visited Los Angeles, my girlfriend and I were the only ones to visit the Korean Bell of Friendship. It is in a somewhat obscure location away from other major attractions but if you take the time to visit, you won't be disappointed. The bell itself is beautifully designed and perhaps one of the most intriguing pieces of Asian history/art/architecture this side of the Pacific. The area is quiet and peaceful and a great place to soak in the beautiful views of the ocean.Fun fact for all you Kevin Spacey fans out there, this place was in a few scenes in ""The Usual Suspects"".",Nomad707
40,Historic Bell,"Worth visiting, historic. It's got it's park and scenic view. You can spend the whole afternoon admiring the scenery.",april
50,Amazing !,First time visiting the Bell of Friendship. I highly recommend checking it out. It was so beautiful up there. Beautiful architecture. Very quiet and relaxing.Must see !,Basma B
50,Breathtaking view!,"Not only is there a history lesson to be learned, but the view is insane!It's a beautiful expansive view that will take your breath away.",jodi B
50,"Educational, historical and beautiful","This is a beautiful monument with a stunning view of the ocean. While we were there, we saw different groups having pictures taken because of the wonderful vistas.I admit, I did not know about this beautiful gift from the Republic of Korea. The temple is extraordinary as is the bell it houses. It's educational to boot.",greengirl68
50,Stunning,"Located in the southern most location in Los Angels, San Pedro. Located overlooking the Pacific Ocean and Long Beach & Los Angeles Harbor this structure is simple, but stunning. Bring your camera.",J.R. Rosa
40,Serene,"Cool history. Situated hill top, with great views of the ocean. Nice quiet place to sit and relax; plenty of green space and bathrooms as well. You can make this a quick stop as there isn't much else around, other than the bell and ocean views.",Lov3ly
30,Not a Destination in Itself,This is in a picturesque area near the humungous port. Parking is free. Point Fermin park is right across the street and also worth stopping at. The bell itself is nice but you'll only want to spend a few minutes there for photos. There really isn't much else to do around it. I think this area is worth going to because of all the photo ops INCLUDING the lighthouse/Point Fermin Park.But the bell by itself isn't a reason to go out of your way to get here.,0garibaldi0
50,Proud Moment,"Seeing this bell, and knowing half my family is from Korea, left me feeling PROUD. This bell hangs from a beautifully decorated roof, and overlooks San Pedro. It's serene. Up close, the bell has intricate artwork etched on it.",hikerchick77
40,Great Views,Came across this by accident. Was a nice surprise. worthy of a stop to check it out. Beautifully maintained! Can see for miles it seems! View is magnificent!,Christina B
50,Nice place to stop and see,"Interesting place to stop and see the friendship bell and the history that surrounds it. Was worth coming here. Doesn't take much time to enjoy the views of this nice, beautiful area.",jweith
40,Get some great photos and views,"The bell is very cool, very picturesque! And you get great views along the coast in both directions. It's a really peaceful place to visit.I didn’t stay for very long, maybe 20 minutes. Unless you take a picnic or your kids are playing in the play park I doubt you could make a trip here last very long. I still thought it was worth it though, even driving out from LA.",C.E.
50,The basketball court at Angel's Gate Rec Center,"Came for great photo op for its breathtaking view, Great picnic area, and best of all is the spectacular basket ball court.",fentyk
40,fun touristy spot,"Ok I will give this place 4 stars becuase of the view. But otherwise I was not as impressed as most of my compatriots seem to be. The view of catalina and the Port of Long Beach are great. However, there is virtually no shade (I mean seriously no trees at all???) and the grounds are ok but not kept up everywhere very well.The colors on the pagoda are beginning to fade and need to be redone, IMHO. But even more important would be to remove the pigeons roosting in the belltower structure. The bell does have a very nice petina on it and I wish there was a plaque or something to translate the Korean into english that is on the bell. I also find it intrigueing that there on the bell they have a traditional Korean figure representing Korea and the Statue of Liberty representing the US.Pro Tip: Wear a hat and sunscreen here. It has a double whammy of direct sun and sun coming off of the ocean!I would have thought that the parking area could have had a tree or two, but alas it was just grass and concrete between the rows of cars. Also the grass on the ocean side of the bell is almost totally worn down to dirt.Pro Tip #2: Do not plan on using the restroom here, unless you want to pull up a shrubbery...However the view presented is awesome. This prometory and the view it affords, is one of the absolute best I know of in LA/OC without a doubt. Definitely a place worthy of spending at least 30 minutes to explore if you havent ever been here before. Very very fun.",Schel74
50,Peace on the Point (Fermin).,"A hidden gem in Southern California. One of the must see places to catch a sunset, a view of Santa Catalina or just he ocean in general. Be aware though that this little gem closes at sunset. There is a kindly guard that eventually will have asked everyone to leave within 20-25 minutes after the sun sets. So get there early enough to relax and just breath. It is an excellent place for a picnic. Sorry, no trees, shade is non-existent. And no mater your age, do bring a kite. It is generally a place for all generations. So, give it a try.",Gilbert H
50,"Recently restored to original luster, perfect family picnic spot","A gift to the United States from South Korea, the friendship bell was recently restored by Korean artisans to it's original beauty. Situated on a bluff overlooking the Pacific, the surrounding grass area is perfect for picnics or kite flying. Across the street is the historic Pt Fermin lighthouse, open most days for tours, and nearby is the Cabrillo marine museum/aquarium.",tlgSanPedro
50,What a beauty! :),"I've been trying to come visit the friendship bell for some time now and finally did a couple days ago and boy oh boy was it beautiful. I started at the bell and made my way over to the San Pedro Waterfront Promenade, Cabrillo Marina, Vincent Thomas Bridge anddddd Rainbow Harbor in Long Beach. What a fun little day trip! :)",Mese_Smith
50,Beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean/Catalina Island/more,Beautifully located with breathtaking views and sunsets overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Bring your walking shoes and a camera for a short memorable experience. Quiet and peaceful. The Korean Bell was give to us by the Republic of Korea in remembrance of the veterans of the Korean War. Free admission and parking.,ET A
40,Nice Stop While in San Pedro,"Situated in a beautiful location overlooking the Pacific Ocean, the Korean Bell sits by itself surrounded by nothing but manicured lawn. Very peaceful area. Well worth the stop just for the views and to take some nice photos.",J.R. Rosa
40,"Great view, good place for a picnic","Needed to find something to do while in San Pedro, this isn't a bad spot. Perched a top a small hill overlooking the marina and ocean, nice cool breezes, good grass fields (yes with actual grass) and even a small park for kids to play with, relax here for a hour or two. Lots of parking too.There is one negative, the bathroom facilities (yes there are some) are beyond disgusting. So if you need to use the bathroom better do it before coming here.",Bo C
50,Beautiful and Quiet,It's an awesome sight to see and there's free parking. Ran into this one on the way to the Sunken city. It is actually a few blocks away from each other in San Pedro.,Yahtsy
40,Spectacular Sunsets!,"Picnic, kite flying, meditation, frisbee throwing, and more! Great place for almost anything. Quiet , calm large grassy area with stunning views. Can be windy at times but other than that and I'm not sure where a restroom is it's a fantastic place.",Gabrielle M
50,Peaceful Beauty,"It's always nice when you can go and not pay for parking! Lovely high point that allows for amazing viewing. I was around the bell area so not too sure about the rest of that area, but there is spec to picnic and let the kids run off their energy and the bell is a great meditation focus for those seeking an inner connection.",TravelSecrets78
40,Beautiful View,"A gorgeous view of the ocean and a short walk away from the cliffs for an even better view.It was around this area and from those cliffs that ""The Dude"" and ""Walter"" said their final goodbyes to ""Donny"" in the film the Big Lewbowski.",The_Roaming_Raven

30,A very peaceful park with a view,"Actually located at San Pedro overlooking the Port of Los Angeles in Angels Gate Park, is this traditional Korean Bell given to America to celebrate its Bicentennial, to honor veterans of the Korean War & to consolidate friendship between the two countries. The bell is within a pagoda style structure, each has intricate artwork. It is on the top of a rise overlooking the Port of Los Angeles & Long Beach, and the Pacific Ocean and provides excellent views. It is a very peaceful park. To the north is an old artillery battery that is also available to visit.",Ray F
40,Great site if in the area,"If you're in the area this is a great site to visit and appreciate! Great pic views and Korean Art, the bell frame is beautiful and artwork exactly like what we saw on our trip to S. Korea last year.",Letty S
50,Blown away by the view!,"In the fall of 2013, the Bell was covered in a large shroud and almost invisible. Today, the restoration of the 17-ton bronze bell at Angels Gate Park is complete and ready to view. Thanks to the generosity of the Republic of Korea who hired the Korean bell masters, they were able to bring the 37-year old bell back to life.On our first visit three years ago in July, we were awestruck with the beauty of the colorful pavilion housing the magnificent bell. Also, from this vantage point, we watched the start of the Transpacific Yacht Race to Hawaii and were blown away by the view and almost literally, by the wind!Tips: take note of the carved statues; restrooms on premises; shoot some hoops while admiring the view!",Shimadog
40,"Beautiful park with amazing views of the ocean. Relax, picnic or fly a kite",One of my favorite spots to stop and fly a kite. Beautifully placed on the top of the point looking down on the cliffs and Point Fermin you can see for miles out over the ocean as looking through a wide angle lens. The wind blows right up the hill making it the best place in the LA Orange county area to fly a kite!!! The bell itself is beautifully painted and is used as a backdrop for many amazing photos... They have a large grassy area to relax and kids to run and play. There are basketball courts off in the back and bathrooms available. If driving along the Palo Verde Peninsula definitely stop by the Friendship Bell.,Michael S
50,Wonderful Hidden Gem with Gorgeous View!,This is a beautiful place with a grand view of the Pacific Ocean. The actual bell is very beautiful with vibrant colors and a nice pavilion. It's nice place for pictures and to admire the bell. There is also a playground and basketball court where people played. And the spacious grass is a fun place to fly your kite. Good place for family. This place is a hidden gem because very little people know about it…and I grew up around this area!,alvina k
50,Worth the trip,"A very well maintained park hosts the Korean Bell of Friendship, which is stunning. For a second, you almost feel as though you may have stepped into another country. The bell's backdrop is the pacific ocean with gorgeous views. Just down below is another great park that hosts a lighthouse and several other historical buildings. Well worth a visit again and again.",BRYAN H
50,"Peaceful, scenic and spectacular!","What a beautiful place to be on a sunny afternoon! San Pedro is lucky enough to house this beautiful piece of art and history and I was very happy to see how well it is taken care of. The grounds are immaculate, the structure seems to be in really good condition. Up on a hill with plenty of free parking and spectacular expansive views of the ocean and harbor. An educational sign to briefly explain the history of the bell. People were flying kites, taking photos and enjoying the atmosphere. Such a picturesque scene all up against the blue blue sky. A fantastic place to take out of town guests, or just to clear your head and take in the sights. Don't forget to visit Pt. Fermin park and lighthouse just down the hill while you're in the neighborhood!",Sally M
40,Fly a kite,"A very peaceful park to have a picnic, fly a kite or play a game of basketball. Beautiful views from this park setting",Sylviada63

50,beautiful building,"It's a really beautiful building built right outside South Bay hostel, on the way to the ocean. Looks great in the sunshine!",christiano_10
20,Disappointing,"Since I like to get updated information, I felt I needed to write this quick review. For those traveling, with this on their 'To Do' list, this attraction is CLOSED. They are doing a restoration of the bell and inside work, so no pictures of anything. It is fenced off, so no getting up close and personal. I wish I would have know prior to taking the drive out though LA's HORRIBLE traffic! Check before coming to investigate",DCDC
50,Korean Bell of Friendship,This outing to the Bell was a really nice one. The Bell itself was unusually large and in a beautiful setting. The view was fantastic and on a hill overlooking the Pacific Ocean. There were tables for picnics and plenty of room to walk around. It was very peaceful and there were not many people around. It also was free.,swrogers
50,San Pedro Secret!,"I went to see it with my girlfriend and brother while staying in San Pedro visiting family. It's a beautiful park! Lots of open spaces and beautiful views! It's history, the former bunker it sits on top of and the bell itself make this park so much more than 'just a park'. I wish I had something like this in my community! Totally worth checking out if you're in the area.",Patrick T

50,Hidden Gem,"This place is wonderful great for sightseeing. Our friend came in from Chicago and we went here based on the reviews.

50,Lovely worth a quick visit,We stopped off here on our way to Venice beach x it's free to park and free to walk around. There was many people sitting on the grass flying kites and having picnics with a great view. The island you can see in front of you has no name. There's a few signs with information. And pictures are easy to take well x,devonstar12
40,A Cultural Experience,"Learn something new and experience art of another culture. The view is unbelievable, too! Beautiful San Pedro. Hike up to the Bell, it's so worth it.",Ilovellamas
30,Neat but boring and cold,"It's a cool site, but it's cold and windy there even in the summer. Once you see it, read the dedication and snap a few photos, there's nothing else to do. It's also pretty far out of the way, surrounded by residential areas and cold beaches. There was only one other family there when we went. Neat story, but don't expect much.",KellyKelly_12
40,Best if seen at sunset!,"Beautiful place to visit at sunset. It's perfect for photography enthusiasts because no matter which angle you take a photo of the bell, it's going to be interesting. There are beautiful views all around that anyone can appreciate.",Caroline L

Also has a nice play ground for small children and land for them to run.The view is wonderful...enjoy!!!!",mbyers
50,Fantastic Monument,"We made a special trip to see this monument as my son, being in Tae Kwon Do, wanted to visit. The drive was a quite a way out of town and took a good hour from downtown but it was worth it.The bell was given to the USA from Korea for the US bicentenial in 1976. It sits on a hilltop overlooking the San Pedro bay and the Ocean.The bell sits in an ornate pavillion on which you can walk. It is a very calm and scenic viewpoint. There is also a small visitors center with other Korean artifacts and more information on the bell.This is worth a visit if you are interested in Korean arcitecture and culture.",dragonjulie
