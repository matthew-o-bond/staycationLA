50,great experience!,"My flight experience with Call the Ball was outstanding! The virtual really goggles really put you in the cockpit and make it seem very real. But just as important, you also get expert instruction that allows you to fly successfully. I also enjoyed getting various tips and insights into what actual military pilots experience. My instructor, Brian, was fantastic. If you have ever wanted to know what it would be like to fly a top of the line fighter, this is your chance. Short of signing up with Uncle Sam and going to flight school, this is as close as most of are ever going to get, and this gets us pretty close",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonBHiker
50,Had a great time.,"Brain was my instructor, he explained the plane and area I would fly in. The flight simulator uses the lastest technology to gave me a great experience. Brain's setup was great and gave me a unique experience.This is something you should try at least once.The flight sim uses the htc vibe for a 360 view, but the cockpit does not move so the is no chance of getting sick.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/883austinr
