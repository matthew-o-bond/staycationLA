50,Best Saturday Flea Market!,"It's a nice little market that is perfect to wander around on a Saturday.I have both shopped and vended at Silverlake and LOVE it!In both situations I have loved the people there, they are chatty and super friendly. It's also great for bargains it's hard not to shop even when if vending :)Highly recommendation, being a vendor, shopping and just having a wander around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jazeb2020

20,Not Worth The Trip - A Bit Tired,"Not sure if I picked a particularly quiet Saturday to visit but it was quite disappointing. There was only a small handful of vendors, primarily selling vintage clothing, there were only a couple of artisans selling their handmade goods.Everything was fairly expensive considering the second hand nature of the clothes however some vendors were happy to haggle if you offered cash.Directly behind the parking lot is a small city of homeless people who‚Äôs trash is sprawling onto the sidewalk and personal arguments can be heard throughout the market...Easy to find street parking but I wouldn‚Äôt bother making the trip if you‚Äôre not a local in the area. Seems a bit tired.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgiaSZ
