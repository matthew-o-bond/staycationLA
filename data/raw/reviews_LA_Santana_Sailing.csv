50,"Best new sailing school in the LA/Orange County, CA area","I have taken several sailing classes with Santana Sailing and have worked my way up to verified Skipper competency (on the water tested) and online theory through NauticEd. The instructor, Marc, is also the owner and he takes great interest in encouraging his students to confidence, success, and competence! I am not afraid to take my boat out on the water with guests! I have also been on the SEA OF CORTEZ slow cruise which is a fabulous way to learn about sailing a Catamaran, have time to explore, hike, snorkel and eat well. Trips are extremely well organized, limited in size. No big groups. I will be continuing my sailing classes in Long Beach to get my Bareboat Certification. I highly recommend learning to sail here!",CriO
