50,Outstanding Performing Arts Venue,"LOVE the LPAC. It is an outstanding venue for all kinds of live performing arts performances. The size is perfect - not too large or too small. They LPAC presents live music, theatre, dance, and comedians. The prices are very reasonable, parking is extremely accessible, the buidling is beautiful and the staff is friendly.",Kathleen M
50,Great show!,We had a great time seeing a lot of different great acts here. No matter where you sit you can have a great time!,L. E. Cox
50,Wonderful Theater,"We've been attending LPAC for many years for plays, events and concerts. It is a beautiful Theater, with no real bad seats. The staff is kind and helpful.My daughters and I were involved in the local theater that performed here and had such an amazing time.",Crystal R
50,An Amazing Performing Arts Center in the High Desert,"The LPAC is a remarkable experience. The LPAC is a state of the art venue with acoustics surpassing many larger, older and well known facilities. There is not a bad seat in the house for concerts, dramatic performances, musicals, acrobats or individual performers. Each year LPAC offers a broad spectrum of live entertainment. All of the performers announce from the stage and in informal meet and greets the quality of the venue and how lucky locals are to have such a facility. The recent Eagles Experience was hard to differentiate from an Eagles performance 25 years ago. Whether Singing in the Rain, Guys and Dolls, Of Mice and Men, The Smothers Brothers, Willie Nelson, B B King, Sinbad, Tony Orlando, Earth Wind and Fire or a host of others - their performances were superb. If you are going to be in the Antelope Valley, check the LPAC website and experience an excellent evening of entertainment.",Archie M
50,State of the Art,"State of the art building and equipment. World renowned acts, as well as up and coming stars you don't want to miss. Comfortable seating, pleasant and welcoming lobby, plenty of restroom stalls, and drinks/snacks available on both ends of the lobby. Comedians, vocalists, bands, plays, musicals, and incredible Arts Education shows for bus-in field trips.Be sure to check out adjoining Zelda's before each show, and even after. Hot night life spot in Great Gatsby theme.",DestinationLancaster
50,Great performances,Not a bad seat in the house... quaint theater with a wonderful atmosphere... love going here to see a show,jenjetmd
40,LPAC downtown,I have been attending LPAC for many years for various shows. I love the theater but I wish the ushers would all do their jobs the same way. in the past I have been admonished for taking pictures of artists performing on stage. Last month when we attended I saw 2 ushers doing that and it made me very angry. It won't stop me from attending shows there.,Sue S
50,Great venue for music,I have seen many productions and concerts there and it is a great place for music. It is acoustically perfect. Small enough to enjoy a personal experience from any seat.,fhughes1
50,Delightful,This quaint place is a hidden gem in Lancaster. All seats are great. The producers and management pull in some great talent.,deserthaven1
50,KB,Very nice venue. All seats are good. First time we sat in balcony. These seats are cheaper but still very good seats. Make sure to ask for cheapest seats or they wont offer balcony to you.A little pricey compared to much bigger and much nicer performing arts centers. Very intimate setting.,Kyle B
50,"Clean, Classic Great seating!",Watch many performances/shows and there is not a bad seat in the house. Clean and comfortable. The staff/volunteers are amazing!!!,Chamorrita T

50,Enjoyed the George Bugatti Portraits of America Concert - October 2016 - Lancaster Performing Arts Center,"We enjoyed going to the Portraits of America Concert with Goerge Bugatti and his group.

There is also a snack bar that sells wine and beer.The show featured the famous songs from cities around the United States. It was accompanied with stellar photographs and some videos of the cities.

50,Dance magic is the place,Once a year my granddaughter has a dance recital at Lancaster Peforming Arts Center it is really nice. There is a lovely stage and the performances of the children are happy. We will return again and again,A_V_Wedding_Lady
40,Worth a stop.,"I love to be taken away with a performance, for a small place it really is nice. Parking no problem. Seats are comfortable. Family, friends, couples all could have a nice time.Worth a stop on a day or night out.",Lora C
40,Great place to see a show,"Good location on the Blvd, not a bad seat in the place. Everybody I have dealt with who works there has always been helpful and pleasant. Good acoustics for music. Small venue but they still get some pretty good performers here. Incredibly easy to get in and out; parking/traffic is never a problem.",Regan R
50,Great Venue,This venue offers the best seating and sound of all the theaters I have been to and that includes Europe!,48traveler_7
50,Excellent Center for the Performing Arts,LPAC as it is sometimes called is a great theater arts location. My daughters dance company use this space every year in August for their dance performance. LPAC also offer a wide variety of theater for all.,Monique J
40,A very nice venue for any kind of music or stage performance!,"We went here for our grandchildren's dance recital. Having never stopped in Lancaster before, we didn't know what to expect. This center is excellentâ€”Lancaster can be justifiably proud of it. We had no trouble finding parking nearby even though it was a full house. The seating is remarkably comfortable and there isn't a bad seat in the house. The sound was very good. Any kind of music or stage performance could be held here. The restrooms were clean (as was the entire center) and adequate to handle the crowd.The only thing that kept us from posting a five star rating is the small size of the lobby. That was inordinately crammed before and after the performance and during the intermission. There is a plaza just outside the front doors, but the weather could make that a poor overflow for the lobby (and you'd have to go through security, again, when reentering). Also, there is no concession stand.",SLOJon
40,Nice local performing arts theater,"I have enjoyed various performances at this theater. It's nice with reasonably priced entertainment and a variety of performers. The biggest challenge is finding parking. (note my review for The Blvd.) Otherwise, I feel safe walking to my car after the performances. Nice for a ""small town.""",hpytravler67
50,Great venue,"When you enter the Lancaster Performing Arts Center (LPAC), you no longer feel you are in Lancaster. It transports you to a venue in LA. LPAC is elegant inside and books a great season in entertainment; that includes concerts, plays, comedy shows, ballets and children's programs. I would highly recommend seeing a show at this venue instead of driving 50+ miles , battle parking and paying over $100 a ticket.",Carter58
40,Date Night Concert,Have been to LPAC a few times. always have a great time there . Good for concerts and watching plays. Nice place for a date.,Gary T
40,Very nice venue,"There is not a bad seat in the house. Excellent design so that everyone has a good experience. No concessions to buy during intermission, probably because it is run by the city and they have rules against it. Very adequate restroom facilities so there should be no waiting in line. If you are going to perform here, you will probably be disappointed in the dressing rooms way down in the echoing basement and the surly, union backstage crew.",Lauralyn K
40,Good Acoustics and Beautiful Seating,"The chairs at LPAC are lush and comfortable and there isn't a bad seat. I have noticed that if you sit in the 1st or 2nd row of the balcony, to the left of the stage, it smells like a used litter box. I sat in that area twice, one year apart, and it is a potent smell. So, avoid that section and you'll have a splendid time watching the numerous artists that LPAC is able to book.",Crystal P
40,KB,Outstanding venue. Saw a Christmas Carol. All seats are close to the stage so it is like you are part of the production. Snack bar is small with a limited menu and not easy access if the theater fills up.,Kyle B
40,Venue is small but Enjoyable,"I have seen three performances here in this intimate but modern performing arts center and have never been disappointed. The prices are much lower than they are in the heart of Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, etc. and the personnel very kind. Lancaster's best kept secret I guess.",RLDrPH
50,Every seats a great seat,"No matter where you sit at this venue you'll have a great view of the stage. It is a great place to see concerts, graduations, and local dancers.",Sharon D
50,Wonderful place to go,This is a great place to see a show or a concert. Nice seating and none of the trouble of driving all the way to LA for the same experience,brandon F
50,Ballet Recital,"This Performing Art Center is perfect, every seat in the house is a great seat. I was fortunate enough to see comedian Gabriel Iglesias ""Fluffy"" perform here, when he selected Lancaster, CA as his free concert city he was promoting on Facebook. There has been many greats perform here, as well as my very own little niece do her ballet recital. Great venue, good times and memories that will last a lifetime.",Max A
50,"Small, intimate local stage","Very small and intimate room to see some great shows. I have been to 20-25 concerts and never had a bad seat. Gordon Lightfoot, Heart, George Winston, Art Garfunkel, Jackson Browne twice, Leo Kottke, Judy Collins, Clint Black, Randy Travis, Kingston Trio, Harry Belafonte, too many more.",Dan C
50,Dad had a blast,"My boyfriend and I love coming here for concerts and comedy, we recently went and saw Paula Poundstone and are going to see The Orchestra next week. I just took my dad (86 years old) to see a tribute to ABBA and they are very accommodating to the elderly. There is not a bad seat in the house, the staff are very friendly and helpful. You can purchase online or their box office is open most days. They do not offer food, but do offer snacks, sodas, water, wine and beer for the show. There are many restaurants very near by to make it a wonderful date night of dinner and a show/play/comic/concert. You can't go wrong! Just check their web sight for upcoming events. We usually go at least 3-4 times a year if not more depending on the scheduled shows.",Annette H
40,"A great venue, not a bad seat in the house.","I've been here twice once for a Big Bad Voodoo Daddy concert. I was seated ten rows back, just right of center stage & it was very comfortable. The last time I went to see the play Les Miserable, for plays I prefer front row balcony. & that's what I got. The only problem I had with that was the Balcony was very hot compared to the downs stairs floor! I'm not sure if it was just that night or it's always like this. The place is small compared to other venues I've been to, so every seat has a good view of the stage. The seats are comfortable & the place is immaculately clean even the bathrooms.",seahunters2000
50,"State of the art, first-class facility","This is a beautiful venue to watch a play, concert or musical performance. You're close to the stage and there's not a bad seat in the house.",Richard R
40,Nice Place If You Like Old People,"Being from Palmdale,I have been here a few times,last was Rock of Ages. Now I am not young by any means but it's not much fun for audiences and actors alike when more than half of the crowd is over sixty ,can barely get on their feet and forget clapping or having a good time. More than once I have felt bad for the actors who are putting on an awesome show and hardly get any feedback from the audience. Let your hair down Lancaster!The facility is awesome but can leave a little to be desired",TanyaRussell_13
50,Outstanding!!!,This place is a Big Town Performing Arts Center in a not so big town. I have been there several times and I can't believe how good the physical place is. There is truely not a bad seat in the house. The acoustics are amazing. The acts that they book are well above what you would expect from a venue in a town with this size population.To the City of Lancaster: Well Done..,SgtMikes
50,A first rate entertainment theater,"As Max Wienberg said when he came out to perform, ""Wow, this place is much nicer than I expected!!"" There are some surprisingly big name acts that come through here.... and usually at ticket prices that are much less than down in LA. Really is a good value.... been going here for the five years I've lived up here. A real surprise.",HatCat44
50,Nice Venue,Came to see a show and the acoustics in here are great.. there is no such thing as a bad seat in this venue..,Jorge B
50,I'm impressed,"Not a huge theater, but just the right size. All the seats have a great view, and the sound is good. Different events from ballet to music venues to plays, it has it all.",bellofthedesert
50,Great shows and not a bad seat in the theater!,"The Lancaster Performing Arts Center has had some really great artists and shows. They don't always get certain Artists because of cost, but I have seen several wonderful performances there. I have seen Smokey Robinson, the Temptations, Debbie Reynolds, several Country Western performances and many musicals. What I love about the theater it's kept very clean and when you see a performance there is not a bad seat in the house. When I sawVince Gill a few years ago I got to sit right up front. It is so nice to see from any seat in the theater and the sound is great!Carol B",carol B
40,Entertainment Not Always As Good As the Venue,"A very nice performing arts center; it's well maintained and attracts a pleasant crowd. I concur that it doesn't have a bad seat in the house. It's reasonably priced and doesn't require a lengthy drive to Los Angeles. And now it has restaurants on ""The BLVD"" that are open before and after performances.The only problem is that entertaIners often fall into two categories: ""Who? Never heard of him,"" or ""Gee, I didn't realize he (she) was still alive.""",Gail1Marie
40,Every seat is good,"It's not a huge venue but it's nice, clean and arranged well. Every seat has a view. You can't lose. Good sound quality too. If only there could get bigger name acts this would be the place for the high desert to see performances.",DoctorDune
