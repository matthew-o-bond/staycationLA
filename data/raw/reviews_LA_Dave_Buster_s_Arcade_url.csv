30,Disappointing at First,"We have been going to D&Bs since they opened in Arcadia many years ago, the grand sons love it. Generally it's a little costly for what you get, but the food is always good in a high fat, high salt way, if not great, and we have always found the service to be excellent. Took my oldest grandson there a couple of weekends ago before the moveis, and immediately encountered problems. The table was sticky and had to be wiped off. The menu I got was so sticky that you had to peel the pages apart. The server seemed totally out to lunch, asking did I want to switch to another table, get another menu, as if I would not want to do either. He put the sticky menu on the table where he got another, less sticky menu. It was not much better. We have a recent diet/nutrition concern that has to be worked around in restaurants, so I asked for the nutrition guide for all their menu items, particularly the salt content. The waiter came back with something else and told me the calorie counts are on the regular menu. When I asked if the sodium content was on the menu, he said, ""I don't know"" and walked off. When he returned, I told him I wanted the full nutritional guide for the menu, that they are required by law to have it on site, I also asked to speak to the manager. The manager showed up some time later with the full nutritional guide and I explained what had happened. I also commented that the waiter did not really seem interested in helping us. When I commented about having sticky hands from handling the menu, he returned with the packets of wipes that they distribute with ribs. From that point on, our service was excellent, but it's a shame that I had to complain and that they are not cleaning menus and tables properly. If it were not for the games that the grandsons like to play, I do not think I would take them back to Dave and Busters again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martha6262014
