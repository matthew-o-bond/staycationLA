50,Great ride,"Wonderful combination of Harry Potter themed attraction with the thrill of 3D motion. Great for all ages. The line leading up to the ride is a wonderful walk through hogwarts, so even if the lines are big, this was still entertaining. Those with motion sickness should give it a miss.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlenFC
10,"Massive line, average ride","The main issue I have with this ride, is the fact that when we started queuing, the advertised wait time was 80 minutes. We then waited in line for well over 3 hours for what was a very average ride.Had the advertised wait times been accurate, there is no way I would have made my family wait this long.Very disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrandTour326888
50,Don't miss this one!,Harry Potter the Forbidden Journey journey ride is one that you surely don't want to miss if you're at Universal Studio Hollywood. It is a thrill to walk through the building and see all the details. The ride itself is exhilarating! Amazing! It is definitely something that will be a highlight of your time at Universal! (besides the slushy BUTTERBEER!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Linenminnesota
40,Haunting Harry Potter experience,"Amazing simulation experience, can be somewhat scary but that is the point. Very dark on the way through to the ride. Do try the single rider option. Visit before eating as you will be thrown around, safely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nick_k_uk
50,Fabulous! great ride.,"We had an early entrance to the park. It was our first ride of the day, no line in a day that later was really packed, so the overall experience was GREAT!My kid is 12 and she really like this ride (she is not a fan of roller coasters).I love it too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karife28
40,Cool ride,"We came here cause my daughter really wanted to get on this ride. Was in line for over an hour and when we got to the front, we were told that the ride was down. We were given Express ticket for the inconvenience. Came back 2 hours later, used our express ticket and got on the ride fast. What a ride! My whole family enjoyed it. I think it’s the longest ride I’ve been in, and it was so worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Louielyn
50,"Fantastic, innovative, all out fun!!","Lockers are avaliable, everything goes into them, a medium size back pack was fine , as mine was. Locked by finger print and the finger print is used to unlock it after.Normal ride rules apply for this ride, pregnant, motion issues, height etc etc!Absolutely enormous fun, you are given the sensation of flying and falling, travelling at speed. I yelled like an enormous big kid and laughed like a crazy person! Absolutely fanatastic!!Got in on express pass, definitely worth it, no waiting",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U1676BDmatts
50,The Forbidden Journey,"This ride is really awesome! Not a typical ride, very unique. The lines weren't too bad, even without express passes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CRR7599
40,long lineups for this popular attraction,"Line up first thing after entering Universal Studios. The line up only gets longer as the day goes on. Use the single rider line up if you can. They provide lockers for free, for your larger bags and backpacks - the fingerprint scan is pretty cool.The ride is fun, and mostly in 3D. During our second ride, it stopped. When it restarted, the 3D screen didnt restart, so you got to see the wall instead. If I had to wait a long time for that, I would not have been very happy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iceman68
50,WOW!,"This was my favorite ride at Universal Studios! Even though there were 4 people in each group, we couldn't see each other. Our legs were hanging free, and it felt like we were there with Harry and the others, flying! Before going on the ride, we walked through the ""school"" a bit. Just like in the movie, there were tons of pictures on the wall. Some of them were moving and talking. I highly recommend paying the extra money to go in the express lines. We never had to wait more than 15 minutes. Most rides we only waited a few minutes, while the regular lines had to wait 35 to 55 minutes. We spent 6+ hours there, easily going from one ride to the other.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sharon8here
50,Brilliant,"We love Harry Potter and went with high hopes, we were not disappointed. The buildings were characterful, mainly full of gift shops and Hogwarts looked excellent. We did both rides which were worth the queue. We loved the spots where you can cast spells and the scenery reacts accordingly...so take your wand. A mention must be made of the staff who were in character and extremely welcoming and helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/328russellr
50,Worth the wait !,"Lines at this attraction are probably the longest in the park, so get an express or VIP pass or early access. Most people on early access seemed to line up for Ollivanders first, so go for this for a shorter wait time. While waiting in line, but sure to notice all the details built into the castle as you walk through !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dware82320
10,This ride was awful .. if you get motion sickness stay away,We were excited to try out the new ride it looks really amazing from the outside. After waiting for about 30 minutes we were excited to get on.The seats are small and feel cramped as a restraint clamps down in front of you with your feet hanging.It starts immediately by spinning you around and getting you dizzy then there is weird images. The tide really has no flow to it just spinning you and making you feel very dizzy. In the middle of the ride it stopped working as many others here say...luckily it was only for about 3 minutes then started again.It ends with you basically in s cloud of smoke for a large part of the ride. My wife and I both left the ride feeling sick and nauseous. I don’t get motion sickness usually my wife does. As I write this hours later we are still feeling nauseous.Not fun at all with added risk of being sick after and or getting stuck for hours in the ride when it breaks down. Never again,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tonytuxedo
10,Stuck in Harry Potter ride...AGAIN!!!,"Came here November of 2018 and returned March of 2019 and got stuck on the Harry Potter forbidden journey ride for at least 15 to 20 minutes BOTH TIMES due to ""mechanical issues beyond our control""...WHAT???!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tourist56183
50,Favorite Ride EVER,"As a Disneyland AND Harry Potter fan, I can say that this is my favorite ride.This ride does get me motion sick though so if you are someone who gets car sick, sea sick, or can't ride attractions with screens and projections than I recommend taking Dramamine. We road it twice, once was a 20-minute wait and other was a walk-on and we got our own cart.It's all inside and the mechanics of the ride are trippy.Some aspects may be a bit scary to littles who don't understand the story. There are Acromantula spiders and dementors. It really is trippy how they spin you around while the dementors are coming at you. There is a part during the whomping willow that you are almost upside down as well.For muggles like us (who pretend to be witches and wizards), this is as close as you can get to flying. AMAZING.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleymantras
50,Best ride in town,"This ride was outstanding. For those not familiar with harry Potter, it is still a great ride, but for those who are familiar with the first Harry Potter novel, it is captivating. Hogwarts comes alive form the moment you start to go through the castle while you are waiting in line, with the animated characters speaking to you and with sets that make you feel like you are really at Hogwarts. The ride has wonderful views of Harry Potter's world, thrilling bursts of speed and motion, and scary moments as the dementors and other dangers threaten.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/834karlp
40,Great Ride but has mechanical issues,"I was super excited to ride this attraction in California as I didn’t get to ride it in Florida. As soon as the park opened, I went right to the ride. I utilized the single rider line and was able to walk right in. As I was next to get on, the ride broke down (I was later told it does this quite often). After waiting about 20 mins, I asked an employee how long he thought the ride would be down, he was nice enough to tell me it would probably be down for a while, that way I didn’t waste any more of my time. I was able to ride later in the day and while on the ride the cars came to a screeching halt right in the middle of the ride when my cart suspended leaving upwards and we were left staring at a huge mechanical spider LOL we were stuck about 5 mins which disrupted the flow of the ride. Overall it is a great ride and a must do, but be prepared for issues that may come up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/23terrab
50,Awesome,This ride was really cool. The line weaved through the castle with lots of Harry Potter decor. Details are amazing with some parts of the que having interactive decor which helps with the wait. We waiting the first time in the regular line which I’m glad we did so we could check out the castle. It was about a 45 minute wait the first time (well worth it). After that me and my boyfriend just got into the single rider line (due to how you are strapped in you can’t even really see the person next to you so it’s really like you are riding alone anyways) and got on in 10 minutes! I definitely suggest doing that if you don’t want to wait in the line and don’t have an express pass. This is one of the best rides in Universal in my opinion and is not to be missed!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erp9413
50,Astonishing,This was my first time visiting the Harry Potter area and ride in Los Angeles. It's even more spectacular and amazing in person. The ride is so much fun. The decor and attention to detail in the re-creation of what we've come to expect from the books and movies is phenomenal. The snow capped roofs of Hogwarts is so realistic. If it hadn't been nearly 100° outside it would've seemed real. Can't wait to revisit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0221Serendipity
10,Been stuck for about 50 minutes now!!!,We've been stuck for about 50 minutes now and counting. I saw the maintenance crew walking back and forth. To the carriage mechanism after ours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Unhappyatuniversal
10,weight restriction not advertised propery,"my cousin is a huge harry potter fan so we waited two hours for this ride. near the end they took us out of line to test to see if we would fit. my family and i are on the heavy side. we only could fit once we were shoved in there! look i get it, it's for safety reasons but the fact is there shouldnt be a guy at the END of the line but in front of the ride itself! thankfully we were able to get on but the whole time i had a major panic attack thinking it was gonna break and fling me off. two hours of park time would of been wasted if we couldn't fit! I hope Universal sees this review and fixes this issue. if there is a tester chair outside there should be a person manning it so that if someone is too heavy for the ride they can save themselves precious hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/635suzys
50,A Harry Potter fan - ‘ must see’ once in your lifetime!,We ended up only riding one ride in the Harry Potter section of Universal because the lines were so long. Most were a 90 minute wait in awful heat. Butterbeer saved the day though- we all had slushy butterbeer. Yum! I wish they would sell it elsewhere. It’s not worth paying over $100 and then paying another $6.99 plus tax just to drink butterbeer. Wish we could have ridden another ride. We did see the wand shop though which was fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USAGerman
40,Get strapped in and get ready for a ride of your life,"Early entry allowed us to get on this ride with a short wait of 10-15 minutes.... worth the extra fee to take this ride once or twice before the hordes arrive and increase the wait to 1-2 hours.Fun and feels as though you are speeding along... if you get motion sickness, you may want to be cautious.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lwj
40,Fantastic!,"The Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey ride is great! The theming throughout the castle is great and really immersive! I will say that this ride (being the original compared to the Orlando version) is a bit more jerky of a ride. They definitely made modifications to the ride when installing in Orlando, so I will say the Orlando version, while incredibly similar, is a less bumpy ride.The line can get rather long (>1 hour at some points in the day), so make this your first stop to avoid the lines.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/165sabrinau
50,Amazing!,This ride is incredible and moves like nothing I have ever been on before. not sure if it suitable for smaller children as it could be scary in places.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lewisandkimberly
50,Loved the ride!,"Not a HP fan, but my family is. We didn’t have an express pass so we had to wait roughly 45-60 mins, but was worth the wait. In fact, our daughter didn’t ride it the first time so my husband waited in line with her for a second time.Unfortunately both times the ride experienced a glitch, which caused us to stop in mid-air. Found out later that this appears to be a common thing with the ride. Graphics are great, while it provided lifelike experience of flying through the air. Beware you may experience motion sickness.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/539amyo
30,Muggles for excitement,"Not really a Potter-head (or whatever they call themselves), but this ride was very jerky. I really hope that after all that training, Harry Potter would have a smoother ride on his broomstick.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewbmusic
20,Got stuck on ride for over 1.5 hours!,"We went on the ride once and it was really great. Since we had an unlimited express pass we decided to do it a second time. Right in the middle of the ride, it shut down and we were stuck in there for over an hour and a half!!! That's precious park time! When we got out, I asked the worker what he was going to do for us, as we weren't stuck for only 10 minutes....1.5 hours was a LONG TIME to be stuck! He offered us 4 fast passes....I told him that we already paid to have unlimited fast passes, so what else could he do...and he said nothing! Not even a free butterbeer! unbelievable!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahmI4233ZA
30,Overrated but fun for HP fans,"The ride is exaggerated, we went their during spring break and there was 2+hrs wait! for 5 mins ride! even to buy the Magic Wand one must wait 30mins!i guess since its new that's why the most attractive ride. The Transformer or Mummy are equally good. If you need more thrill or roller-coaster then try 6 flags in LA.The Castle is made very well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/641vineets
30,Height requirement excluded most of our group.,"Unfortunately the height requirement excluded our youngest HP fans. The good news was that they could wait in line and experience the sights along the way and then go to a room with the movie, at the end of the line, and wait with a parent for the others to return. The ride got mixed reviews from my group. No one rated it awesome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/franki2013
50,A wizards day out,As a big fan i just had to go to the wizarding world of Harry potter at Universal studios Orlando.It was a fantastic day out..took us about 5 hours to see everything..we are not rollercoaster people. So if you want to see the lightshow at Hogwarts it is best to go later in the day. We did do the yourney through Hogwarts..it was amazing inside but the lines are long and take forever. The ride itself was...just wauw but if you get motionsickness like me you come out feeling sick. But i wouldnt want to mis it.Overall a great great day out but veeery expensive..not to say ridiculously expensive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/156wendyk
40,Must-Do for HP Fans,"I'm glad we waited a couple of years to finally check out The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Forbidden Journey has since removed the 3D aspect (yay) and they also upgraded to 4K 120fps (double yay).Of course, none of this made a difference when the ride broke down during the final action sequence. The projectors cut out and we were left sitting there looking at a blank screen. After a few minutes, the KUKA arm started moving again but the screens remained blank. After that weird and unique experience, we were able to re-ride right away and completed our Forbidden Journey the second time around.Overall, although I don't personally love it, it's definitely a great ride. As with everything else within The Wizarding World, the theming and immersion is impeccable. For sure, this is a must-do for die-hard HP fans. Just be wary if you're susceptible to motion sickness (the removal of 3D probably helped with that somewhat).By the way, we rode this during the early entry hour. We walked right onto Hippogriff and then had a super short wait for this ride. As long as you arrive by the time they let everyone in, this seems to be the best strategy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thedlr
50,Awesome attraction but DO NOT RIDE IF YOU GET MOTION SICKNESS!!!,The Forbidden Journey is a state of the art simulator ride that moves along a suspended track. You travel with Harry Potter through and around Hogwarts castle. There are scenes where you are moving with a large screen video to make you feel the sensation of flying along with Harry Potter (this can make you feel quite queasy) there are also live animated objects such as spiders that you will come into contact with. The ride is a little over four minutes in duration. A must see/do for Harry Potter fans as well as non-Harry Potter fans. The line quene is amazing and a ton of detail went into the making of this attraction. I get motion sickness really easy and probably should not have ridden this ride. I had to close my eyes from time to time to keep from getting too nauseated. You can avoid the ride and still experience the quene- its definitely worth checking out if you are ever at Islands of Adventure in Universal Studios.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steelmoney58
50,Excellent ride!,This is a good example of a modern ride with special effects. I truly love this one. One of the best rides at Universal Studios.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DjJassu
50,Amazing Harry Potter Experience,"This ride is simply amazing. You are taken into the world of Harry Potter through ride, special effects and technology. Be prepared to wait a while outside if the park is busy, but once you get inside, look everywhere for Harry Potter references and items from the movie!For anyone that may get sick with motion sickness rides, this one may be a bit tough since you are constantly moving around on the ride.TIP: If you like to see how the ride works, sit on the end of the bench and look down/around the bench from time to time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveDuff
50,WOW,"Unfortunately my sister was too fat for this, dispite her fitting on the test seat outside. The queuing area is fun and there is plenty to stop and look at. The ride itself is a mix of ride and show which works well. It's not the best Harry Potter ride here, but it's certainly child friendly too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrWestSpain
50,Epic ride!,"I didn't personally do this ride (tired old Granny) but the rest of the family absolutely loved it, especially my daughter and grand-daughter who are crazy Harry Potter fans!! I recommend a fast pass as even with that, there was a considerable wait!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/casswife
50,Fantastic Ride.,This was one of my favourite rides in all of universal. The effects are great and the queue is well managed with drinking fountains and cooling fans. The wait to get on the ride is filled with nifty little Harry Potter treats and tricks. Very much worth waiting for.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steve_In_Ulster
40,top ride,"we went there on a friday and the standby wait was supposed to be 55 miutes but we didnt wait that long to get on the ride. we walked into this ride without any notion as to what it would be. we really were surprised, this is the best ride so far in universal at the moment... even though it broke down for a couple of minutes mid ride, it still would get top vote for me and my husband.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cartersully
50,The Best!!!,This ride is the best. We absolutely loved it!! Try to get an A-Line-Pass in order to enjoy it more than once; the lines are crazily long!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natalieb382
50,One of a kind!!,"Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey is truly one of a kind. The designers did an OUTSTANDING job taking everyone from Hollywood to Hogwarts! The mix of technology blends in very well!! Plenty of eye candy outside and inside in the queue. A lot of double takes as you are walking around. The ride itself, a lot of oohs and aahs...The ride is worth taking more than once....When it first opened, there was talk about being ""too big"" to fit in the seats. That put off a lot of people but believe it or not, it's really not as big of a deal. The only thing that is required is that the over the shoulder restraint click. Many average people have been able to ride this ride, including myself that is not exactly ""fit"" if you know what I mean...but I rode it!!! There are test seats located outside just in case you need to double check. If you think about it, this is standard safety for ANY ride, new or old.Other than that, the ride is totally worth the wait!!!! Or, worth the the front of the line pass!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gcfam79
50,Master piece ride,I can say without doubt that this is the best ride in universal studio and Disney land and California adventure park.Sound effects and other effects are marvelous.Go directly to this ride while you are in universal studio otherwise you have to stand in line for long time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/puneet265
50,Full enjoyment,Of the whole universal studio this part is best lived by family for it's rides grand and realist set be it morning or late night. Recommendation dont leave universal before seeing light show.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HrideshSharma
50,Superfun!,"Be sure to try this one on a day where there is not so many people at Universal or just before they close, otherwise the waiting time is forever. But still, the waiting is worth it! The way to the attraction through the Hogwarts Castle is amazing and the ride is superfun! Im pretty afraid of rollercoasters so I did not know what to expect by this one but it was more like a virtual ride, which was perfect!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yava1983
40,Fun ride,"I was really excited to visit Harry Potter and ride the rides and see the surroundings. The ride was closed when we got there. Said it could be a 90 minute wait before it was up and running again. We rode the other ride and still after waiting in a 45 minute line and ride it still wasn't up and running. We were able to finally get on the ride as single riders about an hour later. We didn't have much time left before the park closed. Would have liked to go through the regular line to see all of the attraction. Ride was better than I was expecting. Sometimes I get a little dizzy with the 3D rides, but not so bad on this one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/17edat
50,My favorite dark ride in Orlando,"I really enjoyed my ride on Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey for three main reasons. One, it is a robo-coaster, which means that your seat is attached to a robotic arm that spins you, jostles you, and even turns you upside down sometimes. Secondly, it's Harry Potter, and I love Harry Potter. If you haven't read Harry Potter or aren't a fan, the ride's will be harder to understand, but will still amaze you. Thirdly and finally, the special effects and screens really add a lot to the experience and the thrill, while the wait line is equally immersive as the ride (you walk through the halls of Hogwarts)!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/839jacoba
40,Rides rides rides,The castle is amazing only complaint is you have to drop any back packs off in a finger print locker and the lockers are just a little small very tight fit for my back pack. But overall must do at universal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/309bryceb
50,Do not miss this ride,"Located in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter within Universal Studios this is a must see ride. The lines can get quite long during weekends and Spring Break, but the singles queue goes fairly quickly. You approach the ride through various rooms within Hogwarts Castle from each of the movies. The ride is in enchanted benches which each carry 4 passengers. It moves along tracks and swivels and turns to face challenges along the way, including a Quiddich match, the Womping Willow and Dementors.Do not miss this ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OziDiver
