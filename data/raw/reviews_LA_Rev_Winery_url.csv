10,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!,"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!I called REV with the intention of purchasing beer from them and featuring their product for a community event I am helping plan. When the man answered he did not say his name. I asked to whom I was speaking with, and he rudely answered ""Andrew."" I said hello and introduced myself. He quickly CUT ME OFF and said ""I don't have time to talk about real estate stuff. I'm on the clock and actually working right now so I don't have time to talk to you."" I was immediately taken back by his lack of respect, nonexistent customer service and complete rudeness! I said ""I too am working and was calling to purchase beer from REV, but never mind."" Once he was made aware that I was a customer wanting to buy something and that I was not trying to sell him anything (not sure why he even thought that in the first place) he did not apologize, but instead just said ""ok"" and hung up. You'd think once he realized that he'd made a mistake he would have shown some type of remorse, but no. He he was so quick to dismiss me and not value my business. A key element to running a successful business is stellar customer service, and Andrew provided me with the complete opposite. Even if I had been calling to sell him something, I didn't deserve that type of treatment as if I was insignificant. A simple "" I'm not interested, but thank you"" would have been completely acceptable. Sadly this was my first experience with REV and I can assure you I will NEVER be visiting or recommending this establishment. My colleagues, friends and family will be hearing about this beyond disappointing experience. You know what they say about word of mouth....",Gabriela
30,good lil spot for the ambience,"Unfortunately, their wine isn't as great as I thought it'd be. Im a big wine drinker, red, whites, and everything in between. Their ambience is good, their beer was ok, but their wine was just plain bad. Also, its a very hard to locate spot so be careful if driving alone, it could be scary.",Dayana
50,Perfect for wine and beer.,"The only brewery I know that you can have both beer and wine. When the wife likes wine and you are a beer drinker, this is the only spot to go. Eddie and Andrew always make everyone feel welcome.Love the music, the drink, the good times",Laura W
20,Maybe Wine is better,"Went there on St. Patrick's day for a couple of beers and to get away from the mass of people everywhere else. Now before my review let me say that we've been here before and had their beers. At that time the beers weren't too bad. Now for my review. We each started with a beer. My friend had their St. Patrick's beer which was a white IOS with green food coloring. I had their American Grains which was supposed to be an Amber Ale. Both beers where quite disgusting. The white IOS tasted spoiled and had a vinegar after taste. My beer, the Amber ale tasted like the rubber or plastic hose that carries the beer from the keg to the tap. Add the fact that both beers were on the warm side when served to us and you have the makings of a disaster. Thank goodness for the food truck that we got nachos from. All in all perhaps they should stick to wine, which I hear they are very good at.",DANGELO22
40,Fun atmosphere,Fun place to meet with friends. Good beer and wine selection. Serves food on the weekends. Friendly servers,Rebecca M
40,Winery and brewery,"Great wine and beer but I like the beer better. Hard to find due to poor signage and the fact that they are in a little industrial park with a locked gate, you have to call to get the gate opened on nights and weekends. Once inside, nice folks, comfortable space, and of course good wine and beer.",Bill B
50,a fun local gem,"I went here on a Groupon with a friend. We had a great time and spent over an hour chatting with owner Eddie, having pints of Dirty B craft beer, tastes of wine (the pinot taken fresh from the cask was amazing), and learning about the history and upcoming events. They are going to open another place in Monrovia, CA, very soon. This place is even dog-friendly. It is located in a nondescript industrial park building in Covina. Open every day but Monday.",caltravelgal
40,Old Days,"Back then I use to go to coffee houses that where hidden and had poets or small bands to entertain you as you sipped wine or coffee and relaxed. This reminded me of that time, Its off the track and hard to find you have to call in at the gate so they can open it, its way in the back of a few ware houses, its a small place and all kinds of wine and you can taste before buying a glass also a few beers not standard beers. they sell snacks and have a food truck in the back. On Sundays they have a small band real nice place for a date or different experience. The service is great as it is a small place and everyone is friendly. In one word its relaxing.",LuisMIceman
50,Brewery & Winery,"If your looking for some fantastic beer and amazing wine, this place is awesome! Rev Winery is off the beaten path. It's located in an industrial type setting, don't let that fool you. The wines are made from organic grapes several different varieties and there were 10 beers (from Stout to Blonde). Amazing customer service and you can bring your own food in. Pretty cool artwork hanging up and placed around too! Plus, a large Jenga area! Highly recommend this place.",Linda F
40,Cosy,"Small brewery and winery. Had a great time in their taste room and nice tour. Service was awesome. They also sell some specialty bath salts, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar.",Swishy68
50,Very cool spot!,"My fiance and I recently found a groupon for 2 for $12 tastings at Rev winery. We decided to go on a Wednesday night and we had a blast. The ambiance was great inside, dimly lit and relatively small. It looked like there were games for people that wanted to go to hang out. We sat at the bar and tried two whites and two reds. Both were tasty. My fiance had the strawberry blonde beer as well, which was to die for. Also tried a sip of the habanero mango beer which was surprisingly good as well. We will definitely be coming back!",Kate O
50,An Awesome Covina Find,"We found a Groupon for REV and because it was close to home, we thought we would check it out. We were pleasantly surprised. We met Rebecca, a former Navy person Think of someone with a super personality......that describes her. She also has a great knowledge of the great wines that they have. One of their best wines is called Lodi Souzao. This red is so smooth. If you like sweet wines, then REV Has one of the best Chocolate Ports that we have ever tasted. If you are into beer, they also have some unique beers for your drinking pleasure. They let you bring in your own snack items.......seriously. The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming. See for yourself......check out the wines and beers and then you will see how great REV Winery is. You will also be pleasantly surprised.",daddy1020
50,Great Experience!,"I had the opportunity to visit REV Winery while out visiting my family in California and it was so nice that I just wanted to refer it to Tripadvisor. It is in an unusual location in Covina but as soon as you step inside and meet Edward, (the winemaker) you know that this will be an experience.....a very GOOD experience it was. He is friendly and has a great story which led him to winemaking. IMO, the wine is beautiful and the experience as a whole was wonderful. Talk about hidden treasure!",Stef D
