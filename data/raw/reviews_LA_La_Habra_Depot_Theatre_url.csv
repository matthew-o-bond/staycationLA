50,Nice spot for some live theater,Enjoyed this venue. It has an old town feel. Just wish they could sell food to eat on the patio. Its on their bucket list. Nice performance. Great singing and acting. They did a lot of scene changes which was very creative but please oil those squeaky wheels. Will go again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Snapshotgalaxian
50,Community theatre done really well,"Despite size of this small theater, the management is very successful of putting on professional quality, big production shows. I saw The Music Man and a production of Disney’s Little Mermaid, both were excellent. The theater itself is comfortable without any bad seats. It is air conditioned and parking is super easy. The historical building is also known to be haunted! Great fun for an evening out or a matinee with the kids – and a great value too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eatonmike
40,Very Good Community Live Theater,We attended Fame The Musical at this small theater. It only has about 100 or so seats so everyone is close to the stage. The seats are comfortable. This musical was performed by local dance and vocal students so don't' expect a Broadway quality production. But the young people put on a great show. The prices are reasonable and there is plenty of parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lance2002
