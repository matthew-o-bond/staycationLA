50,"Fans of Victorian era, Halloween, collectibles would love this place!","Great place to learn about the late 1800s, early 1900s of Los Angeles. Susan, our guide, was very knowledgeable on the history of L.A. We enjoyed touring each room and seeing all the fun collectibles! Thanks for a wonderful tour! And thank you for the tips!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GieF_13
