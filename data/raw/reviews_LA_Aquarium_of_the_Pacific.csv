50,Highly recommended,"Well worth the admission, huge range of animals to enjoy and interesting facts to go alongside it. We didn’t eat from the cafe but food looked good.",Ross W
40,Freash and clean facility.,"The Aquarium of the Pacific was a great afternoon adventure. The aquarium was very busy with busloads of children! There were many different movies/presentations that were educational. There is a charge for parking but the aquarium will validate for a partial discount on parking. There is an area outside to walk and picnic by a lighthouse. The Queen Mary is across the harbor. While I was there, I also took a Harbor Breeze tour as they are right next to each other. I spent about 4 hours at the aquarium and another hour with the harbor tour.",Lucky RN
50,A Must See!,"Aquarium of the Pacific is never a bore! I try to visit every now and then and it's always fascinating to see marine life that's well kept here. A must visit,",Nas S
50,In a League of Its Own,We've been to several great aquariums but this is by far the best. The various fish tanks are beautiful and informative as is the signage and docents. The divers conversing with the audience from inside the giant tanks was wonderful. We wish we had our grandchildren with us.,mor734
50,Family Friendly Environment,The aquarium staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. There are alot of restaurants and a shopping center near by. There is a parking garage available as well that had plenty of parking.,Shay B
20,It Has Gone Completely Downhill,"This used to be one of my favorite places. The displays used to have tons of animals, were well kept, and tickets never used to be so expensive. Now, I feel like it's a complete rip off ever since the construction of Pacific Visions. While I like that the aquarium is trying to focus on conservation efforts, it's almost contradictory with all the touch tanks. Hundreds of kids are poking at these animals constantly. The sting rays hardly come up anymore and there are way too many tanks in general. It's great to have a few to educate kids, but there is no need for so many. Staff also don't oversee the touch tanks as well as they used to. No one pays attention to the two finger rule anymore and parents hang their kids over the edge to the point where it looks like they will fall in. The exhibits now have very few animals compared to years ago (sea dragons, jellies, etc). For the price you pay, it is not worth it.",Elissa
50,A great experience,This is one of the stops on our winter vacation and I am glad we made the effort. This place is amazing . You can take your time as there are so many exhibits and aquariums to see. It is also very interactive as my grandchildren were able to touch the rays and fish. The guides are also available and are very helpful and friendly. Don’t miss this attraction.,Rodger C
50,Amazing Place!,"This place is a fantastic place for all ages. Hundreds of different kinds of marine life with detailed information on the species and locations. Beautiful exhibits with hands-on experience with sting rays. You can watch staff in the tanks with scuba gear feeding fish. Location is next to the Long Beach marina with the Queen Mary in the background. We've visted before and waited patiently to a second visit, was still amazed on the second go-around. Plenty of parking, all day costs $8 with validation from Aquarium, very cheap for the area.",Norman H
50,Never enough time to visit the Aquarium,"The amazing variety of sea life at the Aquarium is so impressive. The displays are inviting, intractive and informative. I was pleased to see school groups, families with young children and older adults viewing the exhibits. Thank you for a wonderful visit!!!",Frances D
50,Great aquarium,"Fantastic aquarium. Lots of different exhibits to see, some of which are hands on. We used the go city card which was vert straight forward. Would highly recommend",Zoe C
40,Something for everyone!!,Beautiful views and wonderful exhibits! Brought my 78 yer mother and she thoroughly enjoyed it all! So much to see and do! Many interactive exhibits that’s fun for all ages!,Sarah Jane Abad
40,Interesting and fun,The aquarium offers alot to see. They recently expanded and it looks great. There is alot to learn and you can spend a good portion of the day. The moon jelly touch tank is awesome.,Dawn D
50,Fantastic Aquarium,"Aquarium of the Pacific is one of the nicer aquariums I have been to recently. There are many exhibits, and their hands on exhibits are more varied and fun than the usual ones (Loved sticking my hands in a tank full of moon jellies!). Quite a few of these are outdoors, though, so be prepared if it’s a rainy day. The cafeteria is pricey and not great, but seems like quite a few people also brought their own food, which could be a good option. The gift store is also fantastic and worth a browse. Definitely a nice surprise in Long Beach!",pjlee1971
50,What a place,A must see if you are in Long Beach. Very well organised and the staff and volunteers are delightful. Make sure you allow at least half a day for your visit,haggis502
40,Dive Night,"Fun way to see the aquarium. Bars inside we’re so to get in and running, but it wasn’t too bad. Only thing that would be nice would be to have drinks outside with the food trucks, or some munchies inside.Not too crowded and band was fun - would recommend!",TravlLuv
50,Great visit,"Beautiful aquarium - highly recommended. Lovely, sunny day to visit. Lots of parking. And lots of exhibitd.",Doug T
50,The aquarium for everyone,"Our tour finished here and it was a nice treat. The whole family can find something to do here . We visited the parrot aviary and had to duck when they flew around. They had a great sea lion show and my wife’s favorite, penguins pen.",James C
40,Great experience,"While the aquarium is very nicely done, our main interest was the whale-watching excursion (which unfortunately was a bust that day), we enjoyed both the displays (very educational) and the boat trip as we were treated to hundreds of dolphins that day.",Ckfromkc
50,"See, smell and feel the sea!","We stopped here for a few hours on our way from LA to San Diego, just my husband and me. It would also be a great place to take kids. The aquarium is well designed, had great exhibits and friendly staff to tell you all about them and the animals and fish. We were able to pet sting rays and see a number of ""shows"" in the few hours that we were there. The rescued manatees were one of my favorite exhibits.",mccarthk2018
40,"Great couple hour visit, but pricey",We actually spent about an hour and a half in the Aquarium. It was interesting to see all of the exhibits. One price gave us everything but backstage. The price is a bit steep for seniors. My wife got some good pictures that she hopes to use in an upcoming photography club exhibit. This becomes a good stop if you have any other motive than to be someplace.,KenFromIllinois
40,"Nice, small","Relaxing visit, well maintained. Small but pleasant. The path of visit is a little confusing. Book online for $5 discount. Drink and food extremely expensive inside.",OlivierAZ
40,The best sea life attraction in the Los Angeles area,Monterey has its aquarium. San Diego has Sea World. The L.A. area has Long Beach's AOTP. It is a lovely place with less than great parking. I've taken my nieces there several times and I will continue to support this lovely place. There are abundant educational opportunities. There are a few tactile experience offerings. You get to see sharks up close. The giant aquarium in the main hallway has divers that go into the tank at prearranged times. It is a really cool place. The parking is in a structure that is a bit of a walk for people with walking issues. I am a member and renew my membership in years that I never go. I want to support this place and what it is about. There is nothing else like this in L.A.,steviegjd
40,Nice aquarium,"We enjoyed a nice visit to the aquarium with family. There were 4 generations of our family in attendance, the youngest just turned 4 & the oldest is almost 79 & in a wheelchair. This aquarium is wheelchair accessible & fun for the whole family. Would certainly visit again.",Mac F
50,GREAT EXPERIENCE,It's awesome to see different type of sea creature and learn their habitat. I encoure for everyone to come and visit the Aquarium of the Pacific LB,Footprints323558
50,"Creatures, beauty, and science","Great hours and schedule (9 to 6, every day except Christmas). I toured alone for two hours, and also signed up for the behind the scenes tour. It was a Thursday in January, and I did not find it crowded, just well patronized, largely by school tours. Well- maintained, model educators, stunning wildlife. Do not miss the seals, sea lions, and sea otters! Children welcomed and cherished.",Marilyn M
40,Well run,"While there are no large animals here, they do have the highest standards and do a great job on the education and advocate side of things. I'm not quite on the bandwagon re humans being responsible for climate change but their 8 min video in the awesome theater was so well constructed and pitched that they were definitely getting the point across.",Elizabeth I
40,Interesting Aquarium But Crowded and Noisy,There is a good variety of fish and sea creatures at the aquarium with my favorite being the numerous tanks with jellyfish. The aquarium has great educational activities and theater shows detailing the fragile nature of our oceanic ecosystem. Plenty of things to enjoy over a several hour visit. The outdoor parrot aviary was a big draw for kids and parents alike.,ElTouristo61
40,good aquarium,"This is a very good aquarium, easy to find, they have parking close by, We went in after lunch and was not crowded at all.",firebear1961
40,Very good aquarium,"This is a really very good aquarium with a host of interesting exhibits and tanks. They have a stunning collection of live jellyfish in several tanks.We enjoyed our visit.The only downside is this is very heavily overpopulated with children, all of whom are clearly conspiring and working together to mar your view and assault your ears.",John C
50,Super Aquarium!,"Lots of gorgeous tanks filled with all sorts of very colorful finfish and shellfish! And don't miss the playful sea otter exhibits along with the tanks for the penguins and seals. There are many sea birds and lorikeets, etc. Beautifully clean! Very modern building. Friendly guides. Many interactive displays! A number of movies with seating. All in all a wonderful way to spend a half a day when in Long Beach!",William P
50,"Interesting, teaching, beautiful","A lovely day in a beautiful place. Lots of educational activities and materials, lots of interesting things to see and do. The 8$ fixed payment for parking for the whole day made the total cost acceptable.",Dinnie23
40,Very nice,"We stopped in one morning before a flight, and enjoyed our visit. We were very pleased to know that they had luggage storage, also.",beth ann k
50,Beautiful,"Not the best aquarium I've seen, but it was still a wonderful experience. It has many exhibits and an interactive area to explore. I recommend the behind the scenes tour, but then again, me and my husband love fish so I may be bias.",LOSER
50,Beautiful and well-done Aquarium,"This aquarium is gorgeous. From the outside building design, to the exhibits. There is a beautiful full wall tank that you can see from multiple floors. Tons of species represented with lots of interesting information provided. Several interactive areas, including one where visitors can see what their impact can be on the planet, based on their choices. We spent 2-3 hours there, and never felt like we were dragging it out. Great place!",JessieB112277
40,Good for a day's activities.,"This is a smallish aquarium easily seen in one day. They have a few species not seen elsewhere, like sea dragons, and a fun enclosure of lorikeets you can feed.",Judy F
50,Good to spend a few hours,We visited in January when it was quiet and relaxed . The information and experience is good for children and adults . Would recommend for families,Svetlanashannon
50,An amazing attraction,"In addition to the aquariums and outdoor pools with ray, sharks, penguins etc there is a very interesting area with focus on a sustainable ocean including a state of the art cinema.",Nils C
50,Very informative guided tour,"During my family's visit, we were escorted by a knowledgeable crew captain. The aquarium featured many forms of sealife native to the U.S. West Coast. Some, like whales, were models; many were live, including octopuses, sea lions, manta rays, sharks, and eels. It was even possible to gently touch species that swam in shallow water. Various plaques throughout the aquarium explained environmental concerns and facts about the lives of the species.",H Joseph F
50,Family fun,"We spent a great few hours here, there was lots of activities and interaction for our 4 year old.The displays and tanks were well maintained and staff were really friendly and knowledgeable.There was a big family room which I think would be helpful to know for those who need a comfy space to feed babies.After, we went for a stroll around the marina.Would recommend for families.",Bumbleandthemog
50,An Aquarium With Good Views,We appreciate the spaciousness and variety of tanks to explore. The magnificent huge tank on the far end took up both floors. What was really a treat was the long hallway walk where a seal played. It dipped under water through a cave and happily came out on the other end. From the sealing was displayed a life-sized whale model. This reminded me of the mobile exhibit in the east wing of the Smithsonian National Gallery of Art in Washington DC. A special treat was you walked outside to an enclosed space where several kinds of bird and fish tank exhibits were on hand.,Joseph C
40,Worth a visit while in long beach..but be crowd aware.,"We went on Jan 4th. The place itself overall is nice and well done. The only reason for no 5 star review was their crowd management.We felt like part of the exhibit as human sardines. No joke, we could barely move in the hallways of exhibits. I'm not sure what the occupancy rating is but have no idea how they didn't exceed it. Though they have someone with a manual click counter upon exit I have no idea how they truly sync up how many are in there. They could learn from the Perot Museum in Dallas where they sell x amount of tickets for a time slot. They actually do something called selling out. The crowd was the ONLY negative of the place and it was terrible and nobody ever seems to have manners anymore. We overheard another couple having a similar conversation about the same while there.",Bodilys
50,Thank you for the free wheelchairs,I visited with my husband and elderly father (91) and his girlfriend (92). Thank you for the free wheelchairs for the older folks! It made our visit very enjoyable.,17suzan17
50,Excellently!,"This is a great way to spend a few hours. They have many local species of fish that you can not see elsewhere. We were there off season - in January - and the zoo was still quite good. You can get very up close to many of the animals - there are many places where you are walking right in an area with them running loose. The,Lemurs were fun to watch - the tortoise amazing. Loved it!",Karen U
50,Great place to spend a day,"The aquarium is beautiful. There are some enormous tanks with amazing displays. A humongous whale in the main lobby gives you perspective and sometimes they play with the lights highlighting some elements in the aquarium. Really beautiful. There was no line, I didn’t buy the tickets in advance online and the price was exactly the same. There are several displays to touch some animals (jellyfish, starfish, small sharks) that had my son (3 years old) amazed. Really enjoyed the experience.",OmarTrujillo
50,Great Aquarium,We visited here while on a trip to see the Rose Bowl Parade. It was great. Check out the sea otters. I'm not sure who was looking at who!,DH Butler

50,A day at the Aquarium and became a Memeber,This place is awesome. There is so much sea life and the tanks are beyond beautiful. There is an outside educational area as well as an in side educational area. Great cafes inside and out. Definitely on par with Monterey Bay Aquarium. For very little more we bought a membership so we can go all year. See their website as there are other activities out the front door that you can pair up with your visit such as a fun Harbor cruise.,AuntieMame10
40,"Amazing, but be prepared you are sharing the experiences with the MASSES OF HUMANITY",Really great exhibits and tons of cool stuff to learn- but they don't limit ticket sales so be prepared for a lot of people. A LOT-Loved the various regions of the Pacific!,Drew
10,They should not charge people for this place,"People who give this place 5 stars have never been to ANY other aquarium. Displays were small and not many or not well kept. Go elsewhere, even SeaWorld has a better aquarium. What the heck do they with all the donations they are getting? Don't waste your money here! Go somewhere else. Very disappointed, was really looking forward to it.",Susan M
50,Nice respite from the hustle and bustle of Christmas,"Nice respite from the hustle and bustle of Christmas.

40,A lot of fun,There wasn't much of a line but it's always good to have tickets at hand before getting to the aquarium.,Expedition786400
50,Illuminating,We enjoyed time spent in this impressive institution housed in a landmark construct. So many marine environments and biota are informatively and engagingly displayed.A cogent theme amongst all the exhibits is the conservation and protection of the marine environments that are under pressing threat. Foremost are corals that are particularly vulnerable to temperature rise.Jellyfish are beautifully depicted with arrays floating tranquilly. Starfish are impressive in multi-coloured grandeur.,permia
40,Good aquarium,"Date of Visit: Monday, December 9th, 2019This is a world-class aquarium. The exhibits are well done, well maintained, and have a good focus on Environmental Enrichment. The aquarium has a great conservation program, an educational program for kids (and adults). They teach people about the devastating effects of climate change is having on our oceans and waterways, and thus the coastlines, and the rest of the world.The staff are all very friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful.The cost is decent and within the realms of what you might expect to pay to visit an aquarium.The restaurants//food court are is decent.There is free WIFI that has good service.The gift shop is amazing and has many fantastic items that you will want to purchase before you leave.Parking is across the street in a parking garage, but if you visit the aquarium – you can scan your ticket before leaving and it changes the price to $8 instead of the standard fee.",RogueTrippers
50,Incredible aquarium,We love this aquarium and have had annual passes for a few years and the kids still love going. Some of our favorite exhibits are the lorikeet forest and the batrays. Definitely worth going at least once and if you are local I highly recommend the family pass it’s around 125 for the whole family to go all year.,Nikki W
30,Its just an Average Aquarium,"I have been to aquariums all over the world. I just love the sea and it's creatures. I thought this was a Cliff's Notes version of an aquarium. Nice, but basic. The exhibits are good, but small.Some of the exhibits are actually films. Wait, I came to see the real live exhibits, not a film.I went through the aquarium at a leisurely pace and still finished in less than 2 hours. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Some of the animal exhibits are in an outdoor setting.If you are in the area, go see it, especially if you have young children. There are a lot of ""hands on"" enrichment activities to involve the kids.",Mazuza2
50,Great aquarium,Everything was amazing and this is one of the best aquariums I have been to. I especially loved the Sea Otter show and I will gladly return.,Morgan Piercy
50,All new animals to see,We are from the east coast and this aquarium is unlike anything we have seen back home. So many new species and the jellyfish collection was amazing. Skip the high cost queen Mary and come here totally worth every penny,Jill T
50,1st time visit with my husband and son,"What a wonderful 1st visit to the Aquarium of the Pacific. Loved the layout and tremendous variety of sea life we encountered. Such an array of jellyfish, eels, starfish etc., it was awe-inspiring. We also enjoyed the outdoor exhibits with the stingrays, sharks and penguins. Children and adults will love it! Educational and amazing. Well worth the $34.95 admission price --- used to fund conservation efforts.",Helen E.
50,Very Fun Aquarium,"Loved this aquarium. Lots to do and see. The cleaner shrimp experience was fun. Loved the sea otters and outside tanks were great. Good shows, too.",eboen
30,Would be better with less crowds,I really wish I could give this a higher rating but the absolute insanity of this place stuck with me. It's a beautiful aquarium with lots to see and read about. The downside is that it's so overcrowded that the entire trip will feel like you need to start throwing bows when people are physically pushing you out of the way to see something. Do your research in advance to see if there's a time that's less crowded than others so you can actually enjoy the experience. It's one of the larger aquariums I've ever been to with quite a bit of diversity in the wildlife they have there.,Robert Szklarz
50,First Class Aquarium,"This is one of the best attractions in Long Beach. It is a beautiful place, surrounded by beauty, as well. Along with the wonderful exhibitions (which include lots of exciting things for children), are comprehensive materials about environmental issues. The docent program is deep and extensive, and the training pays off as the docents are excellent. There is plenty of parking, and the aquarium is easily accessible from the 710 Freeway. I recommend this attraction without hesitation!",Terry B
30,Surprised by the 5 stars reviews,"I am not even going to take in consideration how packed it was with humans, but more how packed it seems to be for the fishes. Very small enclosures and crowded aquarium... 50$ a ticket!!!!! Are you serious??? Definetely not worth the price. The aquarium of santa Cruz is much much better.",Lutitlu
50,Great for kids.,Lots of hands on tide and touch pools. Displays easy for small children to see fish and sea mammals. Very informative. Staff are helpful. Parking is easy.,Judy C
40,Informative and worth a visit!!,Lovely aquarium with beautiful surroundings at long beach. This aquarium was really informative and the animals and fish looked well looked after. Lots of information about the environment and climate change. We don’t have children but there was a lot for kids to do. Really enjoyed the touch tanks too.,Lorna and Matth... C
50,Great day out,This is a really nice aquarium in Long Beach California. It is very easy to reach and with a lot of parking. The place offer a great time to kids and adults and the amount of species of fishes you can see it is pretty large. There are penguins too in case you want to see them..:) . Very nice place to spend half a day with your family and friends.,F-F
50,Fun and educational,"This is a great place with both indoor and outdoor activities. If you have a Curious learner with you, remember to join the guided tour. Feeding the birds are also with great fun but you have to go earlier before the birds get too full. You need a whole day there .",Agnes Leung
50,Great day with our grandsughter,"We visited on a Thursday morning before most of the crowd so our 3 year old granddaughter could move more freely. A little later the school groups arrive and if can be chaotic for the little ones. There was a pop-up type interaction with horseshoe crabs that was fascinating and the docent was outstanding. There is plenty of mixed activities for viewing, touching and being out in the sun. We brought a picnic for outside. Such a nice day.",Rosanne211
40,nice aquarium in the heart of Long Beach,"Great place to visit as part of an overall trip to Long Beach. They have really done up the downtown area well. Plenty of places to see and eat at. The Aquarium isnt the biggest or best I've ever seen, but its a great stop if you in the area and worth a visit. Check Groupon, they often have discount tickets.",Don B
50,Aquarium visit,"Brilliant place for adults and kids. Loads to do, not just marine life but some other things too. Great displays and good staff. We loved it. Best aquarium we have been to",Craigmoyes61
40,Wonderful,We bought a family membership so that our grandchildren could experience all the wonders of the sea. The Aquarium of the Pacific has continued to improve and add new things. Go people you will enjoy it.,805onthego
50,Last day of anniversary week,"This was a spontaneous stop, to kill time befire our hotel room was ready. So glad we did it. We have gone to many Aquariums, and they are all so similar. But this one was just different enough to be engaging, even for adults. And very wheelchair accessible",susan
50,Quick visit,Decided to visit the aquarium to kill some time to check into a hotel nearby. This is a great small aquarium that has a lot of exhibits of all kinds of aquatic life. They also have a Lorikeet feeding facility where you can buy a cup of nectar and they fly on your arms and eat. This is a place I would visit again if I'm in town,electrical_steve
40,The staff are incredibly friendly and informative,"Visited the Aquarium with a friend, the staff are really friendly and informative at both the front desk, cafeteria and the touch tanks. Various touch tanks let's you touch and come up and close with the jellyfish, sharks, stingrays, etc. Would definitely recommend taking a trip out to Long Beach to visit the Aquarium of the Pacific and see everything that they have to offer. Great fun with friends or with a date, or children, in other words, fun for the whole family!",toriaella
40,Better than expected,"Recently experienced the aquarium during a private event held between 6 to 9pm. My experience is probably different from a typical visitor as I was able to see most exhibits with one or two other visitors around me. However, some exhibits were off limit.I had been to larger aquariums such as New England Aquarium in Boston, National Aquarium in Baltimore, Monterey Bay Aquarium, etc. This aquarium is much smaller in size as compared to those aquariums. However, judging by its own merit, this aquarium is designed quite well given that: 1) the marine life forms are clearly visible inside each tank; 2) the viewing area surrounding each exhibit appears to be sufficiently roomy so being able to get close to an exhibit even when there is a crowd should not be too difficult; and 3) the aisles are wide so the likelihood of getting trampled should be low. Of course, your experience may be different when you are amongst a crowd.With respect to the exhibits, the focus appears to reflect the aquarium name, which is marine life in the Pacific although Pacific is a big ocean so maybe the namesake is too ambitious as the number of exhibits is quite limited. To me, the most interesting exhibits are related to jelly fish. In fact, there is a tank in the outside courtyard full of jelly fish. There are more than ten tanks of various subspecies of jelly fish inside the aquarium. Most tanks have lighting that illuminates the reflective body parts so the effect feels out of this world, especially when the area surrounding a tank is darker than the tank.Is it worth the price of admission, which is $34.95 for an adult without any discount as of this writing? The answer if likely a yes if you are interested in marine life forms and could take the time to look at every exhibit. Creating and maintaining an aquarium is a costly endeavor after all.",Eric W
40,A nice way to spend an afternoon,"Spent a good few hours walking round. If you go a little later you miss the crowds. Staff are friendly and knowledgable, and the otter talk was great fun. Plenty to see, lots to do, places to eat and drink, shows and talks.This was a very educational visit, and it mkes you stop and think.The gift shop had some great items to take back as souvenirs, I thoroughly enjoyed my time here and would happily return.I could happily stand for hours just looking at the varieties of jellyfish.",Surveyor47
40,We were wowed 😊,"Great few hours spent at the Aquarium of the Pacific, Awe inspiring Pacific Visions theatre a must see, makes you think. Enjoyed up close encounter with the rays and parakeets. Very welcoming and informed staff. Well worth a visit.",Swanningaround0107
30,Good for visit with kids,I guess I went there on a very crowded weekend that's why the experience was a little bit disappointing to me. I like the exhibits but it was too crowded and the toilets are not clean. You could also see through the door slits what the person in the stall is doing.,Grace Naces
30,Aquarium Trip,"It was ok, but expensive for looking at fish in tanks ! The Penguins were the most amusing, but if you want to feel a shark or a jelly fish, it's all there ! Hundreds of young children in buggies, so quite difficult to manoeuvre a wheelchair but at least it was free. ( wheelchair hire ) The shops have amazing gifts if you are prepared to pay the price. All in all, my preference would have been the $16 trip around the harbour. I know the aquarium upkeep is expensive but $70 for two pensioners is too much for what we saw. Cafe was ok, good coffee, boring hot dog...expensive !",lizziejane119
40,Im glad I was able to visit this,"The place is good and that there are a lot of sea creatures in it. Seals, penguins, fishes, and others could take the stress out of you when you visit this place.",Jeremy Perater
40,Nice way to spend several hours,"One poster gave a low rating because there were no dolphin or whale shows. I give them 5 * for not having any of those. In my opinion that’s abuse. Whales and dolphins should swim free and not be “show ponies”. This Aquarium does a lot of sea life education, so valuable.",Lovebs12
50,Awesome,I never get tired of visiting this aquarium. Another must see in the Long Beach area.It’s quite an attraction.,golflover26
50,Under the Sea.,"With the new addition this is a world class exhibition. It will wow even the jaded teenager in the group. Public transport from LA is still weak, upgrades are in the works as of 10/1/19. Parking is convenient, and with the Queen Mary close by it’s a full day out. Long Beach has gotten a pretty cool beach vibe going on in the old town as well. If you’ve taken the dog on the trip, go to Rosie’s dog beach and let them run free.",Bruce r
40,Aquarium of the Pacific,My husband and I went with our daughter. We were impressed by the large manta ray and seals. The Magellan Penguins were the cutest. I would recommend this to families with small children.,Dorothy Y
50,Lovely afternoon...and they have penguins!!!,"We came here as part of our ""staycation"" with our son. I had no idea how diverse our Pacific waters are. The exhibits are easy to see, and there are lots of benches if you want to sit and admire the creatures and their interactions with each other.The restaurant was closed, so we went to the snack cart when we got hungry. It does not have many options for people watching their blood sugar, so I was glad I had a Trader Joe's meat stick in my bag.After our snack we continued to wander - that day the Aquarium was open til 9:00pm, which was cool because some of the creatures are more active at night.I look forward to going back, and would definitely take out-of-town visitors here.",GrundyLisa
50,Really interesting,There is so much to see. There are indoor and outdoor habitats representing a broad range of water animals. There are employees standing nearby to answer all your questions. I recommend starting a conversation with one of them because they are very well-versed in the creatures and their requirements.,Lisa L
50,Great Aquarium!,"Nice experience, we were there as adults but it would definitely be great for kids. The shows and feeding were fun to watch!",Donna R
30,"Go on an off day, off time","Made the mistake of going on a Saturday afternoon, and even though it was off season in late Sept, there were literally 10,000 people there, 6,000 of which were fussy, shrieking, shoving little children. Go on an off day, first thing in the morning for better luck. It’s a nice super-modern facility with rather typical sea creature exhibits but ultra modern audio-visual exhibits and a promising dedication to promoting renewable energy and sustainable food production. Park on the top floor near the elevators. Expensive: Tickets $35 ea. Validated parking $8.00. Two coffees and a big cookie $16.00. Steep.",Gregory R
40,Fun time,"Beautiful displays, hands on activities and fun for the kids.666153765See manatees, sharks, dolphins and watch the rangers show you how the fish are fed.The jellyfish are beautiful . The staff explain the exhibitions to you with enthusiasm and knowledge.",Rena G
40,Nice Aquarium,"The aquarium is well-done. All of California fish are represented in different exhibits. There were fish in aquariums without name picture cards available, that's the only complaint - we wanted to know what they were called. We also took the Blue Whale and Sealife Cruise. It was okay - maybe too long for our son, but enjoyable. We saw tons of common dolphins and birds and a humpback whale. I'm glad we did it. Be sure to take a jacket if you are cold natured - the aquarium is a bit chilly. The cruise is on the Pacific and with the wind, it does get cold when the boat is cruising out - take a jacket and a hood - hats will fly off.",Jency T
40,Much more than penguins,"If you're looking for a great aquarium destination, the Aquarium of the Pacific is the place for you. Happened to be there during Labor Day weekend so it was more crowded than usual. They were open until 9 P.M. to accommodate the traffic. Look for discounts so you can save: for this occurrence attended after 5 P.M. to get in for < $20, however, realize most of the shows are only in the daytime. There are many sights to see here including penguins, jellyfish, sharks & the very cool looking Japanese spider crabs. Located in the aquarium is even an area where you are able to touch the stingrays-just make sure to remember to wash your hands afterwards!",locke869
50,Queen Mary is fabulous! GO,"Brunch on Sunday is fantastic also,not cheap tho. It's also great to just walk the ship and sit in the observation deck bar. I'm going Friday night 9/20.",C G
40,Beautiful,The aquarium was beautiful. Especially the many different jellies. Just expected to see a few more selections had a lot of the same things.,Teyiona
30,Nice small aquarium but nothing special,If you are staying in Long Beach and enjoy aquariums I would recommend you visit but it is a rather ordinary aquarium. The sea lions are fun to watch but otherwise it is pretty standard.,Susan3181959
50,Excellent Aquarium Experience,"We enjoyed a wonderful half day self-guided tour of the Aquarium. The exhibits were informative, and we didn't hit long lines the day we went either (a Thursday afternoon). Great for kids and adults alike. Easy to access via walking or hop on the free red Passport bus and get dropped off at the Aquarium stop.",SASH
50,Best Aqurium on the West Coast,"This aqurium has everything you want tropical fish, artic animals, and so many other kinds of sea animals like penguins.",aliciamar23
50,See the ocean without going to Sea,"Living in California, by the Ocean, we rarely get to see anything. This will give you a view of the Oceans without getting wet. The variety of sea life is amazing and you have no idea until you see it all in one place. The best part is that the water is clear to see all the fish that normally are hidden in cloudy water. My wife and I enjoy going here each year each summer. Our favorite thing to do is visit the Lorekeet birds and feed them. They come right over to you and land on your shoulder if you have the nectar they feed on. The shark pool is great but its about as close as I want to get to them, I still remember seeing Jaws in the theater. Get there early so you can find a parking spot in the structure, it fills up quickly. We usually have lunch outside on the boardwalk area as there are plenty of nice choices.",410brettb
50,Delightful experience - amazing variety and fabulous staff,"Wear walking shoes, be prepared to be outside - I assumed an aquarium would be mostly indoors - NOT TRUE for this site. And it is delightful. DO be sure to visit the lorikeet area and see the free films (some are 3D) while you are there. If you like to collect smashed pennies - bring quarters and pennies!",Terese B
50,Top Notch and NOT just for kids - great destination for date,"UP FRONT I must say how FANTASTIC the staff here is. ALL very helpful and pleasant.We purchased tickets online the morning of our visit. It was easy and IF you send yourself the pdf via email then NO NEED to print, just show your code at the door = skip the line!- DO get your parking validated once you are inside, not free, but reduced price of $8. Thought it was odd the garage did not have sections marked, so pay attention to where you parked (level and row)- We went on Labor Day - while it was very crowded just inside the entrance, we headed to the far end (Shark area) and worked our way back - this helped avoid the inevitable stroller traffic.- REALLY REMARKABLE was how very reasonable the prices for gift shop items were.- TIP: I typically send myself a postcard from every attraction we visit. Fun to receive it in the mail post trip and enjoy the memory of the experience.- DO be prepared to be outdoors a good portion of the time = sunblock and good walking shoes needed.- I encourage parents to remind children not to tap (bang!) on glass - leaving smears on surfaces and not so nice for the animals either.Loved, loved, LOVED the Lorikeet area. Got some AMAZING photo snaps here.",Terese B
50,Amazing Sea Life,The sea life was amazing. Things I had never seen. The tide pools for touching the sea life was fun. It Sea Dragons were my favorite. This is a place you will want to visit when in Long Beach or Los Angeles.,Sue A
50,New Upgrades...,"The Aquarium of the Pacific is in Downtown Long Beach, Nestled in along the Shoreline Village, Pike area..Wonderful way for Children to Learn what's in Our Oceans ! Come by, and check it Out !",beverlyc886
50,Great for children,tide pools for touching marine animals offer a great experience for children of all ages as well as adults.,Knobert
50,Loved it,Amazing to see a non profit like this doing what they can to raise money and awareness. Highly recommend the seal and sea lion show as well as the otter show.,swearwolves
50,Perfect family day destination,The aquarium was a perfect spot for us to get out of the hot sun and view some marine life from the west coast. Our teenage boys found plenty to interest them. We especially enjoyed the penguins and sea horses.,Karen H
50,Great time!,"My friend and I visited over Labor Day weekend. It was our first time visiting. They had a deal running where admission was only $20 after 5PM, and they stayed open until 9PM over the weekend.We had a wonderful time. We were able to see everything we wanted to see with little issue. It was time and money well spent.The area surrounding the aquarium has greatly improved since prior to the aquariums opening. We both decided we would like to return just to check out the other venues.",Tanya N
50,After 14 years.... I finally returned,"It has definitely changed a lot since I last came here when I was 12. A return was set in motion and I came here with a friend and we absolutely enjoyed it! We unfortunately missed the Bird petting outside and the Jellyfish Petting as well Nooooo T . TBut we were able to do everything else, and I must say, my favorite part, was interacting with the staff working here. The staff are honest, and absolutely bright and very knowledgeable. They handle the animals with so much respect and joy, and ensure how to educate the public in how we ought to conserve and protect our environment and the wildlife living in it. My second part, was in the very beginning. I got a manicure from a special kind of shrimp! The staff told me how it would clean the dead skin cells and other things from your hands and the experience was so cool!! The girls were super super nice and funny, definitely a memorable moment! The third best part were the penguins and jellyfish! Watching jellyfish is such a therapeutic thing to do, especially with the music they make. And seeing the penguins, will turn anyone into a child again. Highly loved the Seal show as well! It was funny and cool!!Something I recommend is bringing your ticket with you from parking so you can get it validated inside, before you leave back to your car. Once you have it validated, then you go to the machine, pay it and can leave peacefully. I also suggest bringing a thin sweater, as some places get really really cold! Also, bring a portable charger. Some sections, your phone won't get signal and it will drain your battery mad fast.I can't wait to come back again and be like a kid again!!",Brian
50,Fun place to spend the day,We went with no kids (a rare moment) and had a good time. It’s a beautiful aquarium. There is a lot of preaching about conservation so just know that going in.,dkmwilson
30,Pleasant visit,"My 13-year-old daughter and I visited the Aquarium of the Pacific on the morning of Sunday, Aug. 4 while we were in Long Beach.Even with an $8 off each coupon that I got out of a travel booklet that our hotel gave us, I thought the price was a bit steep.If you have kids, be sure to grab the visitor guide and map. There are places to stamp in the guide, and stamp stations throughout the aquarium.We began our visit by watching the short movie on a huge Imax-like screen. The movie talks about how we should all make changes to help the environment. However, I was annoyed that the movie says that increasing aquaculture would be good, without including any information about the negative aspects of aquaculture.Continuing on to the exhibits, we enjoyed the interactive quizzes. We also liked seeing the fish and other sea creatures in the smaller tanks. We happened to see divers feeding the fish and rays in one of the large tanks. One of the divers was wearing a microphone and talked to the crowd while the divers fed the fish. She shared some interesting facts about the different fish in the tank.We really liked seeing the full-size model of the blue whale that hangs in the building. (We were lucky to see a real blue whale the next day when we went on a whale watch trip out of Dana Point.).In the outdoor area, we enjoyed touching the rays and the small sharks (even though that’s something we’ve done before at our local zoo). We were very disappointed in the large shark tank, however. The shark tank was basically a cement tank with just a few small sharks in it. I saw zebra and a blacktip reef shark, but I didn’t see any of the sand tiger sharks that are on the website and in the visitor guide. Seeing the sand tiger sharks was the main reason I wanted to go to the aquarium, so not seeing any was a letdown.Before entering the lorikeet bird area, I paid $4 for a small dish of what I assume was sugar water so my daughter could feed the beautiful birds. When we first went in, all the birds appeared to be full; none of the birds were coming to eat the food. Toward the end of the exhibit, a couple of birds finally jumped on her hand and ate the food. I suggest making sure the birds want to eat before shelling out the money for the bird food.Overall, it was a pleasant and fun way to spend the morning. I recommend going if you’re in the area, but definitely look for discounts off the price.",eskiedogs
40,Great Place for a Family,"Overall I had a great time there. It was interesting and the exhibits are really nice. My only down to this is the number of kids. It was overwhelming and you couldn't enjoy most of the tanks without them pushing and shoving you. Plus the shrieking too and running around uncontrolled. If that is your thing, great.Again, I did have a good time and the exhibits were really good and very nice park personnel.",gmcp3251
50,So much fun so much learning,The Long Beach aquarium and new pacific visions is a thrill. There are fantastic exhibitions and many opportunities to be awed and learn. The children here were all riveted the price is affordable its air conditioned and fun for at least 1/2 day.,Jeffrey S
30,Why do they have large mammals caged?,"The aquarium itself is clean, modern, well staffed and interesting but I was dismayed that they keep seals confined to do tricks for an audience. Not necessary with what we know about the mammals I think it’s cruel and heartless.",onpointaboutit
50,Busy with kids but informative,I understand this is a place for children and it is a wonderful experience for them. No problem. The staff was very informative and patient with everyone. I loved the theater experience.,Diane G
50,must see!!!,Nice aquarium to see. Not a huge place but well layed out in Pacific ocean regions.They are very well maintained exibits and are updated frequently. Many interactive things to do and volunteers do a good job of telling about the exhibits.,David R
40,Enjoyable way to spend an afternoon!,"Trying something to find to fill a summer afternoon with an 11 year-old we picked the Aquarium of the Pacific. It was fun, easy to navigate. Parking, Restaurants and Shopping at the Pike (nearby and minutes from home). The exhibits are educational. The lectures and films were also very well done. Skip the passport scavenger hunt its not worth the effort. Although, the passport idea was a great way to see the entire aquarium. Great staff and volunteers.",Mrs. Baker
50,Educational for all Ages,"We have an annual membership here. It really brings down the price and opens up special evening events. There is a ton to do, inside and outside. Of course you'd expect excellent sea life to views, but how about water splash pads and lorakeets? (Birds). The crew does an excellent job of bringing conservational, environmental awareness, and ocean fundamentals together in a palatable and fun format. This place is perfect no matter what time of year, but summer is especially great because of the splash pads and nice cold interior climate.",Jennifer S
40,Excellent 2 hours,"Nice aquarium. Been to several around the country and this one was clean and well run. Lots of cool technology to keep things fresh. The actual exhibits were small, was hoping for an awesome shark display but that was underwhelming. Lots of kid groups were there on a week day. Fun time. Good to note that they have several penny crank machines. My daughter loves it when I travel and find them for her.",Dan T
50,Lots of entertaining,"You have to go and spend at least 3 hours, that will pass as a sip. The exhibitions are pretty cool, specially the jellyfish. They also have a sort of performance at the Molina Care Center with an eal puppet wich is a lot of fun. They have penguins, sealions and some birds. Afterwards you can enjoy a walk on Pike Outlets or head for a good restaurant around the area.",gabriela m
10,"Bring Your Photo ID when Using Debit Card, Eat before you go, no great cafe open for extended hours offer","Terrible experience with Shayla at cashier window, we had no photo ID to use debit card. Just add this to website. Terrible for locals as we made an evening of it and walked! Then, we found out rudely from the waitress that the great scuba café was closed!! Extended hours 5-9PM to many of us means extended service. Spoke to Millennial Customer Service Supervisor, he had no clue! Shame for such a great venue.",Stephanie B
50,Love this place,"Beautiful, fun, great aquarium with many hands on spots which are nice for children... restaurants on site and just an overall wonderful place to visit.",jenjetmd
40,Definitely Worth a Visit,"I decided to go to the aquarium shortly after their opening of Pacific Visions. I had not visited there for many years. The new building addition looks absolutely huge from the outside, like it might have doubled the the size of the prior building. In fact, most of the new space is devoted to a large-screen (think IMAX) movie auditorium, showing an original movie about how human population has grown so large that the land will not feed them all in the next several decades. It didn't dwell on the usual global warming scares the environmentalists and politicians love to talk about without doing much to correct. Instead, it took an optimistic solutions theme by concentrating on how today's existing technology can be applied to farming food in the oceans while protecting the existing abundance of life there. Think about very large fish farms in mesh tanks submerged in the ocean or fresh water to raise wide varieties of fish or shellfish, engineered to maximize the feeding, health and yield of the tanks' contents without upsetting the natural environment outside the farm tanks. They showed how todays wind turbines can be adapted for underwater use of ocean currents for electric generations. I left very uplifted and satisfied that they told me useful new ideas in an intelligent manor.The rest of the aquarium was more conventional, but with many strange and unusual sea life that one does not usually see. All told, I spent between four and five very satisfying hours there.After leaving, I walked across the street and enjoyed dinner at Bubba Gump's shrimp restaurant, a good place to enjoy some sea life after the aquarium.",rendahl
50,Beautiful large viewing tanks of sea-life,"The sea-life look like they are in their natural environments, albeit, the tanks create a confined space. We touched some sharks. I liked the Northern Pacific area. The moving jellyfish are amazingly beautiful.",KodoDrummer
50,Hundreds of beautifully coloured sea-life.,"Excellent location for us, as we visited after having a downtown meeting. Lots of aquatic life. We especially loved seeing the jellies, sea otters, sea turtles, hundreds of colourful fish, clownfish, and many others. It is easy to go through slowly and spend two to three hours.",InnaYYZ
50,Lots of hands on exhibits,"Easy to get around because it is very spacious, shows going on all day, clean tanks, large selection of fish. Instead of scuba divers, I would have liked to have seen mermaids (like Denver’s Aquarium). Friendly & helpful staff. We took a free bus ride to & from the Queen Mary ship.",Kelly M
50,Excellent,Loved the opportunity for hands on fun like touching the jellyfish and feeding the lorikeets. The aquarium is beautiful!,kvso
50,Fun for everyone,"My boyfriend and I came here to spend some time before we head back to Boston. It was a big (not super large) aquarium with plenty of things to do and see. My boyfriend and I were playing with the scavenger hunt activity that was probably meant for kids while we were looking around. Though when we went, it was during the week and it was field trip day for the school kids. Lots of kids running amok, chaperones trying to control them. This is great for everyone, young or old, families, and couples.",Doris
40,Big and interesting,"A very interesting visit. They have lots of aqariums with lots of different animals, also outside. Also lots of information about the sea, for example by a movie. Also a couple of gift shops with very nice items for good prices.",kajsa234
50,Great Place!,"I attended a private event at the Aquarium and it was a great place and a great event. I loved the exhibits, the staff and the price was reasonable ( I checked because I was going to attend before I found out I was invited to a free event). I would love to attend again with my kid.",sweetnsourlady
40,Fun for families,There were tons of families when we were there. Hard to walk amongst all of the strollers. The aquarium definitely caters to families S it should. An adult traveling with friends can hit the highlights in an hour! Just watch out for strollers!,BethMorrison6
50,Really Nice Aquarium,"I really enjoyed visiting the Aquarium of the Pacific. It's located right down by the waterfront in Long Beach, just a stone's throw from the Queen Mary. The museum was recently renovated and looks great. Though it's not the largest aquarium around, it has some very nice exhibits, and more interactive exhibits than a lot of places. We were able to touch sharks, manta rays, horseshoe crabs, jellyfish, and more. We also had a lot of fun with the lorikeet exhibit. If you buy a little $4 cup of sugar water outside, the birds will land on you and drink from it. The staff were friendly, parking's easy, and you can even pair an aquarium visit with a whale watching tour.",jonathanM1234567
30,Attended a Conference,"It’s small and seems a little outdated. The gift shop was wonderful and the prices were right. There were some seals who were extra friendly, though.",Rita T
50,Fun and Educational too!,"The Aquarium of the Pacific is a great place for the whole family to spend the day, On display are fish and other marine life from all around the world. Upon entry, you receive a wonderful Visitor Guide and Map which is extremely useful. It not only tells you where everything is, but it also has colored pictures and nice descriptions of the various sea life on display. This guide can be a useful sea life reference even after my visit,In the Honda Pacific Visions Theater you can see a very enlightening multi sensory film that shows ideas for for conservation and how we could create a sustainable future. Pacific Visions also has many other high-tech multimedia exhibits which really made me think of how we must steer clear of energy sources that pollute and lean toward sustainable sources.I had an overall great experience at the Aquarium of the Pacific. I enjoyed looking at the fish, birds, penguins, etc. Unfortunately, we didn't have a chance to dine or catch an animal show. We really enjoyed the gift shop! So many beautiful things to buy,",MRO_13
40,Educational and Fun,"Great aquarium, nice flow from exhibit to exhibit. We always learn something new when visiting aquarium. There are fish, sharks, mamals and birds from different parts of Pacific Ocean. There are lots of educational materials about animals and environment. They are doing great job explaining about human impact on environment and what can be done to minimize/eliminate negative human impact on oceans and environment in general.For peaceful time the best it to visit during work days, late morning and early afternoon. By that time organized school children visits are over, and you can have place for your self.",Bedjobb
50,"Worth a visit, recommded.","Worth a visit, not a giant place so not an all day affair. Giant tank with fish, as well as an outdoor area where visitors can touch sea creatures in tidal pools.",Dana Los Angeles
50,Great Aquarium!,"This is a great option , compared to Birch aquarium in San Diego , it’s much bigger.It’s a 2 floor aquarium with different sections , all the exhibitions very well maintained very clean. It takes like 4-5 hours to get through itThere are some shows ( seals and otters ) it’s a plain routine ( not sea world style), but yet very entertaining for the kids.Don’t forget to stamp your parking ticket at the exit so you can have a $8 flat rate",Jaime Himes
20,Disappointing,"Although a visibly stunning building on the outside, the inside is cramped and sterile. Were it not for the huge model of a humpback whale in the lobby one would never know they were in an aquarium.The actual exhibits are located down narrow dark halls with very little direction as to where to go or what to see. Once down these halls the viewing windows are small and many were high making it hard for small children to see. There is one small area of interaction where you can touch starfish and sea urchins but this one was all I saw.We went in to fill the time before boarding a dinner cruise and I was worried that 2 hours wouldn’t be enough time to see everything. We were finished in 30 minutes!! I have been to many of the top aquariums around the world and this is definitely at the bottom of my list; making the $35 ticket an insult.Summary? Enjoy the beautiful building from the outside and save the $35!!",fotojo2
50,Great time at the Aquarium!,"We try to always visit an aquarium while on vacation. This aquarium was easy to get to, and had easy access to parking. You can get your parking validated inside to pay a smaller fee. There were lots of different fish to see. My youngest really enjoyed the penguins. Our oldest likes to be able to pet and touch things. The shark lagoon was fun. They do a feeding too that you can watch. We all really enjoyed Lorikeet Landing too. The lorikeets are so pretty. But watch out for poop! The moon jelly touch tank was also a favorite. These jellyfish can sting you, but their toxin is so mild that you can feel it. Every person working in specific areas were really so knowledgeable about the fish/animals. We had a great time and got some great pictures and have great memories. I enjoyed their gift shop as well!!",Michelle S
50,A lot to do and see,"There is so much to do here, and it always seems to be changing for the better. Plan on spending a few hours so you can see it all. Everyone that works there has always been helpful and friendly.",Robert M
20,Sunk,"I wish I could say how much my family and I enjoyed our time at the Aquarium of the Pacific but I can't. I had heard so many wonderful things about the aquarium that I was expecting to see something spectacular like I had at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, but was disappointed in what we experienced. The aquarium is small and the exhibits are too. If this is your first time to an aquarium then you'll enjoy what you see but if you've been to Monterey or another world class aquarium then don't waste your time or money here.",Art
50,What a great place.,"This was the basis of our trip to Long Beach,and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The parking structure is near. I have walking problems and must use a walker. The staff was so accommodating and helpful. There were hundreds of children there as part of their summer camping experiences but they were unbelievably well behaved. We liked the aquarium as that is what it is. It doesn't have rides, all kinds of gimmick shows, but just a lot of great viewing with very helpful staff. We recommend it without reservation. Don't get food there for they really rip you off. There are many great restaurants within walking distance.",PalmDeano
50,Refreshingly Pleasant and Balanced,"I have to admit I was a little skeptical walking in. We had just been to another aquarium recently and I wasn’t ready for the barrage of people, dark viewing areas and screaming children. Thankfully, the Aquarium of the Pacific provided nice traffic flow balanced with pleasant outdoor viewing areas. There were lots of people but I never felt claustrophobic. The balance of indoor and outdoor viewing of the sea life made a HUGE difference and made the entire experience really enjoyable.There were plenty of hands-on activities giving patrons of all ages something to experience. Another big plus was several of the exhibits were narrated by workers who provided nice educational value to what was being viewed.Parking was easy and close by and the aquarium even provided parking validation to lower the price even more.All in all, the Aquarium of the Pacific was very enjoyable and turned the tide on my bad attitude toward aquariums.",bobbydee2015
30,Under da SEA!,"Great place for the family and kids to learn about the wonders of the sea. Seals and se lions, penguins and birds are featured. Plenty of interactive displays to help keep the kids interested. Touch the stingrays and gentle residents of the sea.",Darren S
50,Great time with the family,My youngest daughter said it was great and they give a prize at the end if you fill your passport. All the teenagers had a great time there.,Paula D
30,Day at The Aquarium,"I took my two grandsons for the day at the Aquarium. We became hungry, but did not want to choose the snack bars. We chose the one ""restaurant"" on the second floor.My vegetarian boys were satisfied with their grilled cheese sandwiches, BUT my hot dog was without question the WORST ever. The ""dog"" was fatty, and the bun was stale.The fries were also STALE!! The total (with only one water bottle) $39.04!!!RIP OFF!!! DON'T EAT THERE!!Later we tried a Mango/ Pineapple Smoothy...couldn't finish it because it was WAY too sweet. ($6.00) Another RIP OFF!!There are a few good restaurants near the aquarium...eat there.",Sharon A
50,Cool place,"Must see if you are in the area. Not a cheap activity, but it’s fun and interactive. Great touch tanks and animal shows. Also close to the marina, lighthouse and the outlet malls. Great for a relaxing day in Long Beach.",Jennifer J
40,So much to see and so many people on a Saturday,"Our family visited the Aquarium of the Pacific on a Saturday in May. As you can imagine it was very crowded due to fact that it was a Saturday, but unfortunately this was the only day during a California trip that we could go. The first thing you notice about the aquarium is the beautiful shiny blue building. It is very futuristic looking. Part of this is a new wing of the aquarium called Pacific Visions which had not yet opened at the time of our visit. This aquarium has lots to see both inside the building and outside the building. There are many tanks on two levels of the buildings where you can marvel at creatures from around California and around the world. Outside there are areas exhibiting penguins, seals, sea lions, and other creatures, including a shallow pool where you can gently touch small sharks and rays. We managed to join the crowd in watching the Seals & Sea Lions show and thought it was well done. Although this is an aquarium, one of my favorite parts was the visit my daughter and I made to the Lorikeet Forest exibit. Inside a large netted area you can walk among more than 100 brilliantly colored lorikeets which are birds native to Australia. For an additional $4.00 you can purchase a very small container of ""nectar"" and attempt to feed them. We did purchase the nectar and found that the lorikeets were not shy during our visit and were quick to land on our shoulders and arms in attempts to get at the nectar. It was nice to see the birds up close and personal as they are beautiful. Be forewarned that the small birds are somewhat greedy and can make the nectar disappear quickly. If you plan to share one nectar cup among several family members make sure to keep an eye on the remaining volume of nectar at all times. One tip that can come in handy is that some visitors discard unused nectar so you might be able to find additional nectar in the discard bin at the end of the exhibit. We ended up eating lunch at the aquarium. My wife and I had brought sandwiches while our children purchased food there. Our son purchased a peanut butter sandwich and salad on the building ground floor and seemed satisfied. Our daughter, on the other hand, was anything but happy with the meal she purchased at the Bamboo Bistro food stand near the Lorikeet Forest. After waiting in a very slow line she purchased cheese pizza which came with a slice of watermelon. She said that the pizza was awful and had freezer burn though the watermelon was good. Somehow, for $8.50 you expect a little bit better than that from your food! Before entering the aquarium we parked in a large parking garage adjacent to the aquarium. I believe that the parking cost $8.00 and that if you get your parking stub validated as you exit the aquarium you can get a ticket that will reduce the cost by $1.00. In summary, there is much to see at the Aquarium of the Pacific and we recommend that if you visit that you do so on a weekday and that you bring your own food.",rockwood13
50,Behind the Scenes was Awesome!,"Thank you Cynthia (education staff) and Rachel (shark lagoon aquarist) for an amazing behind the scenes tour and shark feeding! AOP has amazing staff. HUGE shoutout to Cynthia and Rachel, they made our day! :)",Tanner Linden
50,Educational visit,Me and my family really enjoyed our visit to this place my daughters learned few things about the ocean and the life within; I believe that is a great place to visit but maybe just once the area that surrounds this attraction is very nice and clean and great shopping and dining options,Jorge V
50,Visit In June 2019,Family trip to California with 16 yo and 21 yo son to see the Fish and best of Long Beach Aquarium was great a seemed a little small compared to others around country. But we'll put together with a lot for younger patrons to do. Be sure to get the combo with tour of queen Mary the city has a bus to take you there for free the passport. If you go to the Aquarium parking is 8$ for the day no matter how long you stay. We enjoyed the pike shopping and restaurants before heading to The Queen Mary. Had a great day.,beachbum5024
50,Above Expectations,We loved visiting the Aquarium- it is a lot bigger that we expected and there was so much to see! Also some interactive areas. My favorite exhibit was the sea dragons!,live0051
40,Very nice aquarium!,"We visited on may, we liked it, we enjoyed the place, we bought combo tickets that included also the entrance of the Natural History Museum.

50,We loved it!,We had a great time at the aquarium! I had been unexpectedly in the hospital for several days on our vacation and we decided this was something we could do. They had wheelchairs available and my family pushed me around to see everything. The exhibits were excellent and the workers/volunteers were very informative and helpful. We loved all the hands on activities especially the tide pool area and petting the moon jellies! That was awesome! My older boys enjoyed all of the pokemon sights that were there. Haha!Will definitely go there again if we are in the Long Beach area.,4kidsandcrazy
50,Loved that you can pet some of the animals here,"This was a visually stunning aquarium with a huge array of different marine animals (and frogs!) Lots to see and do here, you will not be bored. Highlights included petting a small shark and having sea urchins ""grab"" my finger when petted. Of course it goes without saying, small children should be monitored here so that the animals are not grabbed at or scratched. Staff were very knowledgeable and willing to answer questions and discuss the animals, which was a great learning opportunity.",Eleanor

50,Beautiful and Well Done Aquarium,"Spent over 2 hours exploring this aquarium - you can touch rays, sharks, and even Moon jellies!! The staff were very informative and knew how to make the conversation interesting for both the adults and the kids. Parking is validated for a flat 8 bucks. Coming from the south, we saw tons of marine life we had never seen before. Highly recommend this aquarium!",Dixie G
50,Best aquarium in Southern California,"The Aquarium of the Pacific presents a wide selection of biological environments. We were able to touch and feel many of the creatures in the various exhibits. There are specific exhibits that present the flora and fauna of areas such as Northern Pacific, Tropical, Baja California. There are educational volunteers in each area that are well informed and give an explanation of the fish/animals. The highlight was being able to touch sharks and rays and learn about their habits.",lleon2014
40,Good for an Afternoon,"Spent an afternoon at this aquarium. It is a pretty solid one with our highlights being the front tanks, seal tanks, jellyfish and the outdoor play area. The life size boat and giant sea creature play structures is something we have not seen in many aquariums. Worth it if you happen to be in the area.",Flyer253281
50,Educational and Focused on Conservation,"I’ve been coming here with my family my whole life (we’re members) and I thought I’d review it after seeing the new Pacific Visions wing which just opened a day or two ago. There are a number of exhibits listed off by geographic regions (North Pacific, California, and Tropical Pacific for example) and even some birds like puffins, penguins and the ever-popular lorikeet exhibit.The new wing of the aquarium is really cool and has a large theater featuring vibrating chairs and other effects. There is an interesting Infinity mirror exhibit with coral, a lot of interactive touch-touch screen displays showing how you can live sustainably, and a few tanks with critically endangered species like the delta smelt (this being the first public display of the fish at an aquarium).I like how this aquarium places a strong emphasis on environmental conservation and showing what we can do to make the oceans better for the plants and animals that inhabit them. It seems like they good care of the animals on display and aren’t just here for our amusement but to also protect individual animals unlikely to survive in the wild and maintain endangered species like the aforementioned delta smelt fish and the golden mantella frog. Definitely a great place to learn about aquatic life.",Colby S
40,"Beautiful aquarium in Long Beach, CA","My out of town guests who lived in CA 40 years ago, requested to come here as part of their short stay. The seniors in our group especially loved this aquarium. It's easy to navigate, there was a great Q & A session, touch tanks, and divers in the water this particular day. The huge tanks, lighting and habitats are just gorgeous.",Chris D
40,Great,"Long beach is an amazing city , with harbor, lakes, channels, yachts, etc.If you go to long beach you must visit the Aquarium, it costs 30$.",Steve P
50,Aquarium visit,"Looking for something new on a trip with my daughter. Decided to go to the aquarium with my daughter and mom and dad.The aquarium is desent sized with elevator access to the 2nd level. There are also exhibits outside.Outside, the moon jelly lab was cool. You get to pet live jelly fish! You also can pet rays and sharks. We also went into thw lorikeet exhibit and fed the birds, nectar. The birds flew rifht to our hands, landwd on our arms and drank the nectar. The sea lions and penguins are also outside. We got to see the fewding/training of the aea lions, which was fun.Inside, there are lots of walk through exhibits representing different areas of the Pacific. There is also a frog and other amphibian exhibit.I would recommend getting a coupon like we did, and save money. We had one for $21.98 pee ticket, instad of the regular admission. Don't forget to validate your parking ticket if you are staying longer than 3 hours to get parking at $8.All in all, a nice spend of a half a day.",Anthony P
50,Great place to visit,I went here with a discounted pass from a conference I attending in Long Beach. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit there. I am from the east coast so I was able to see animals that I don't see at the aquariums at home.,Hollye K
50,Wonderful experience!,A friend and I did the Aquarium/Harbor Cruise combo. What a fabulous experience! The aquarium has many exhibits to enjoy and we had lunch on the upper level and ate outdoors. It was lovely. The harbor tour was fun and informative and a nice way to better see the coastline around Long Beach. I would HIGHLY recommend taking a trip to this area when you are in Southern California.,Heidibrarian
40,Favorite aquarium,I've gone here ever since I was a little girl and I'm still going and I'm almost 18! my favorite exhibit is the lorakeets and the stingrays,Jenny Beauchamp
50,Fantastic,Great aquarium with a fantastic variety of expositions from Pacific fauna to Amazon frogs. Try to get in early before the school field trips!,PepePitMD
40,Great Aquarium,"I really liked this aquarium! It was large and had a huge amount of wildlife. They had a touch tank for stingrays (my favorite!) and they had a nice frog display as well. You can grab a beer while you are walking around. It's very kid friendly but also had some great exhibits geared for adults as well. If you are in Long Beach and you like animals, I would highly recommend this place. They even have a lorikeet area where you can go in and feed the parrots!",Erica I
30,Nice Place to Visit While in Long Beach,"My wife and I enjoy visiting aquariums whenever they are available at the location we are at. The one in Long Beach doesn't really compare to some of the larger ones, i.e. Baltimore, Monteray, Hawaii, etc. However, it was enjoyable and entertaining. The sea otter demonstration was fun. Be aware, at least the day we went, there were a tremendous number of school classes. You only need an 1 1/2 to two hours to see all the exhibits.",roberte35
40,Great Aquarium,This aquarium has a lot to offer. The highlight for our family with children of various ages was the bird feeding. For $4.00 you get a small cup of food for the birds that immediately fly to you upon walking into the aviary. The struggle is how over crowded it was and this was in the middle of the week. I did find that later in the afternoon there was far less people. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The aquarium was well maintained and clean. Worth the trip and the family loved it.,Mrspalzy
50,Outstanding aquarium!,"My husband and I visited and were extremely impressed.This aquarium has a wonderful variety of beautiful fish, as well as penguins, otters, sea lions, and lorikeets. There is also a terrific educational component to the aquarium. The gift shop has a fabulous selection.We enjoyed a nice box lunch from the outdoor cafe.I highly recommend a visit for couples or families.",TravelerfromNJ2
50,Ohhh The Fish,"We took my little 8 year old cousin and she had the best time! We touched sea cucumbers, star fish, sting rays, sharks, listened to a story, saw some birds and of course the cutest Otters! And if that wasn’t enough we also got to watch the new under the sea movie.If you’re looking for some hands on family fun then this is a great place for all ages. I would recommend bringing hand wipes, checking the internet for discounts, and your patience too. As looking for parking can be challenging in the structure, and the elevators take a long time.",MarketingDiva
40,Rock Solid,"You can knock this aquarium out in 90 minutes. Although full of fish, some of which are super cool, spend most of your time watching the Otters. We've been to many of the great US aquariums, and although there are a few that almost equal this old beauty, none have the feel of the sea quite like this one. Worth of every penny to check off this box.",the Don
40,Pleasant place to visit,"I was visiting a friend in California and we took a day to go to the aquarium in Long Beach. They offered a senior discount for age 62 and over of $3 per ticket. They also offered a AAA discount but you need to ask for it.The day we went there were quite a few school buses so there were many children there. Things moved slow through the exhibits, but they were very nice and were all labeled.There is a food area but we didn’t order anything, other than water. They have a small store with all kinds of shirts, toys, books and other aquarium related stuff.This was a very pleasant experience and the price was very reasonable.",Sheryl L
50,Educational and Fun,"Even when you are there during Spring Break and there is a large crowd of people it is a fun place with a toddler! Everyone is friendly. The kids have fun. The exhibits are displayed for ""kids"" of all ages! There is plenty of room for kids to be kids and run. Places for you to park your strollers if you want. Plenty of room to keep toddlers and infants in strollers and have room for adults to navigate. You can people watch and look at all of the exhibits. Toddlers and small kids can interact with the Penguins. It is truly fun for all ages, very young and old.Singles,Couples, Family one and all! Short time or long time. The longer you stay the more you will see.",James R
50,The Behind the Scenes Tour is well worth it!,"We've been here many times before while visiting family in Long Beach, and have always loved it. This time we decided to go for the Behind the Scenes tour and were very glad we did! We were lucky enough to be the only ones wise enough to have made this choice so we had a very personal experience. We got to see where the food is prepared, where the divers get ready for the frequent shows, and feed the fish in the quarantine tank that were in transition. It was an amazing glimpse behind the curtain of one of our favorite places to visit!",hollimar
40,Jellyfish were great!,"Well I never thought I'd headline a review with a tribute to jellyfish! But then again, who knew how beautiful they could be? They were what most fascinated me, though I was also thrilled to touch a starfish in the interactive part of the aquarium. This is a really nice, modern attraction - though a touch over-priced in my opinion - but I enjoyed my visit.",Janecanaries
50,Easy afternoon attraction on a school day!,"Visited on a weekday afternoon. It was crowded with school-aged children, but was easy to attend presentations (sea otters & sea lions), and very informative. Since it was the afternoon, it did not seem as crowded, and the aquarium and related facilities were clean and accessible.It was great getting to see the Magellan penguins from south America, but I was disappointed that they weren’t provided an environment that had the moving water to create waves as is in their native habit, such as there were in nearby exhibits for different animals. (A nearby exhibit had the moving water that these penguins use to gain access to the shorelines in Argentina, but it was not evident in this exhibit).School-aged volunteers were leading the presentations for a couple of exhibits, such as the sharks and sting rays that are in pools so you can carefully touch them), which demonstrates the value the aquarium puts on its role in education.Parking was a breeze. Consider buying tickets to the aquarium and other tours (such as the Queen Mary), as a package for a discount. Also, buy online to avoid lines at peak times.",Dana M
50,Fun visit,"Aquarium of the Pacific helps to teach us about the most valuable resource around us, our oceans. We learn about the importance of the oceans and the animals and plants that live there. We learn about pollution and the problems that it causes.",AMNYC1988

I have been to other aquarium locations across the US and would rank this one up there with the others. I will go again when in the area. Great for kids to enjoy and participate in activities.",Nancy C
50,Well-designed: Get a maximum experience with minimal walking.,"Some of us can't walk long distances, so we usually shy away from major attractions like this one. This aquarium defies that stereotype. We absorbed every exhibit and saw every show, plus 2 movies! For efficiency, get a visitor guide, map, and list of show times at the entrance. Be sure to see the outside exhibits, too. We held some freshly-laid shark eggs! My favorite creature was a sea-dragon, which is similar to a seahorse, but it is camouflaged like seaweeds.",Kathy D
50,Fish everywhere!,"Get there as early as possible because school tours fill up the place with kids. The place is clean, employees helpful and it takes a few hours to view the place.",petitesandra
50,Educational,"I love going to the aquarium, there are things you can touch. you don't have to spend all day there. its a great price. I enjoy the Behind the scenes tour, there is a lot of cool things to learn and see. I always learn something new every-time I go.",Emily W
50,"Amazing, and underrated aquarium!","Not only does this place cover everything aquatic, but it has an immense amount of interactive exhibits, where you can touch small sharks, jellyfish, sponges, stringrays, and a whole host of other things - more than any other aquarium I have been to. The shows are great, the layout is fantastic, and the amount of wildlife and exhibits they have is far above the average aquarium. Definitely one of the best ones in the United States - and we have been to most of them.",toddone1

50,Great Experience,"First, please know there is no need to ""skip the line"" as purchasing tickets at the aquarium is fast, convenient and easy. This is a rehab facility for these animals. There were many great aquatic wildlife to see and fabulous staff to educate! I would definitely recommend this for ALL ages!",Pam1775
40,Fun Day Activity,"Enjoyable activity for cooler or rainy days. Part of the aquarium is outside, but most of it is indoors. Multiple shows are presented in different venues within the aquarium throughout the day. Great way to learn more about California’s maritime “scene”.Tips:- Look into one of the package ticket combos. We opted for the aquarium and Queen Mary combo. Aquarium ticket was for same day entry while we had a year to use Queen Mary ticket. When we did, we exchanged the ticket at the Queen Mary ticket booth and were able to also reserve time for a tour which was included in the ticket price- Other combos are available as well.- You can also buy online and avoid the long line at the ticket window.",Michael M
50,I pet a shark!,Some friends and I were in town and had a few free hours. We decided to take the Passport bus (free!) to the Aquarium. The exhibits are so beautiful and well-lit. The outdoor exhibits are great too. Although the plexiglass on the outdoor exhibits could be replaced. We really loved the shark area (the sharks that can be pet are small). The rays and crabs were great to watch. My favorite by far is the Puffins! I love them and they seemed to “find the camera”. They’re so adorable! There were a lot of school kids there in field trips. They really had a great time if their energy is any indication! I highly recommend visiting.,Karen F
40,Jellyfish are awesome!,"There's sharks, manta rays, turtles, frogs, birds, and lots of fish, jellyfish, penguins, seals, and otters. (No dolphins) We piggybacked onto the school kids who were on a class trip and it was fun watching them see all the exhibits. Great staff here.",AuntieGenius
50,So Much Fun!,"I am from the east coast and this was one of the best Aquariums I have been to. There was so much to see and so many different exhibits and different types of fish, jellyfish, sharks, otters, you name it and it was there. Aside from what you typically see at an aquarium, we saw frogs and birds. One of my favorite parts was the outdoor bird exhibit. We got to walk through and feed the birds. There was also an outdoor area to pet sting rays which was really cool as well. There were many info sessions going on about the sea life so it was nice to stop and listen. I highly recommend!",bklynbaby7

50,We are members....worth it,"If you go more than 2X per year buy the membership as this is what an entire year will cost you. This place is pretty special.

50,Rainy day activity,"On a recent business trip, our free day was unfortunately a rain out. We discovered this gem of an aquarium. We also got in for $9 each because we had been at a conference.

40,Nice afternoon activity,"We spent a couple hours here. It was nice to watch the animals at feeding time. Also, it wasn’t crowded on a weekday which was a plus. Be sure to look online for discounts. We saved $11 each that way.On a side note...the chocolate croissants were amazing!",Christi K
30,Aquarium,"Very nice building, have to pay for parking. The exhibits were nice, they have sharks sting rays, sea turtles (2) octopus’s (2) and an amazing variety of jelly fish.

We touched so many different animals; Jellyfish, stingrays, horseshoe crab, starfish, and more.The Loreleets are fun to visit. If you buy the nectar they are all over you.We truly enjoy each visit.They have a job shadow program for teens interested in careers in the industry.

40,Pre Cruise Visit,"We didn’t pay full price thankfully, I think the admission is a bit steep and if we had not had discounted tickets from our hotel we most likely would not have gone. However, it is a fabulous aquarium we completely enjoyed it. It’s very clean and the aquariums are amazing. We really enjoyed the jellyfish, sting rays and sea lions.",Borders24U
30,Glad I didn't pay full price,"The Visitor Center at the convention center informed me that after noon admission to the aquarium was only $9 with my conference badge. Good deal. They said to allow at least one hour. Easy ride on the free Passport bus. While I enjoyed the exhibits and thought the aquarium was well done, I was done in 40 minutes. There just isn't much to see. Biggest attraction was probably the penguins, stingrays and sea lions. The displays at the free St. Louis Zoo are much, much bigger. So, I was disappointed. Had I paid the full price,I would not have been happy.",notcarla
50,"Great time, great for kids","Many exhibits, lots to see, stuff to touch, great time. We took our 3 year old and she was ""in her depth"" with all the stuff to see and do. Plan on at least a couple of hours. They offer a military discount also which is nice!",Jeff W

30,"Good Fish, Bad Vibe","Crowded with lots of kids and families on a Sunday afternoon, no problem, I get that, but no one around to keep kids from climbing everywhere and stroller city prohibiting others from viewing and little people running around, so not an easy experience, but OK, came for the fish. And, lots of fish in many tanks, but the place seems so old school and dreary and uncheerful. Place needs a redo, refresh. Outside architecture so inviting; inside, dull and bland. Exhibit info old school; didn 't see any interactive or new tech use. Was rather disappointed despite the large aquariums and many interesting aspects of sea life.",PlatinumHoney

50,"We love this aquarium, except for the school groups","We thoroughly enjoyed all the displays, from mini jelly fish and seahorses to sea otters and penguins.The shows at feeding time for the otters, harbor seals and sea lions are great fun. Best to arrive at opening time to avoid crowds. While I think it's great that the schools have this resource, groups of unruly screeching children reverberate through the building and I feel sorry for the sea life as their glass walls are being pounded on.

The whole place had an interesting vibe to it, my teenager said it felt like Penn Station in NY, lots of people in the common areas selling goods. My kids love penguins, and they did have a decent exhibit with a cute area for the kids to get ""up close"" with the penguins. We got into the 4d theater for the penguin documentary which was actually very interesting. On the way out we hit the main gift shop and we ended up spending almost as much time in there as the whole rest of the aquarium. They had so many great things to buy.",Tzivia R
50,Pleasantly surprised,"I was pleasantly surprised with this aquarium and really enjoyed my visit. I've been to some great aquariums around the country and didn't expect too much at this Long Beach facility. However, the aquarium is very well done and informative. I especially enjoyed the jellyfish and the informative talks given by the staff. Highly recommended.",Travmama
50,Awesome place,"Rarely do I get a chance to visit the Aquarium, but it is always a treat to go there. They always concentrate on educating the people about ocean life and how pollution and climate change is impacting the ocean. The large aquarium tanks where they replicate certain environments in the ocean is always breathtaking. Though it was a bit crowded, and parking was a little hard to find, it did not take away from the experience of going there.",Joshua Y
50,Great for kids and adults,"We take our grandchildren to the Aquarium at least 3x/year, and they always love it.

40,Loved the birds the best,"This wasn't the BEST aquarium I have even been in, but after a second go-through where we saw what we missed the first time, it got bumped up another star. I was pushing a wheelchair and didn't have a nice good easy map so I THINK we saw everything. What was the real highlight was the bird aviary. There were about 95 Lorikeets, many landing on people. My husband had 3 on him, one person had 7, and I had one land on my head. Beautiful little birds and really fun.",GoodKarmaTraveler

40,Very entertaining for all of ages.,"This was a great place to get away from the normal bustle of the LA area. We'd been visiting big theme parks on vacation and this was a great place to relax and unwind. It was busy here but still place to relax and watch sea creatures up close. We enjoyed petting the rays in their tank the most. Watching all the animals through the glass was endless in entertainment and there are lots of windows. There was lots of different animals, fish, birds, sharks, rays, jellyfish, otters, penguins, etc. If I'm in the area I would probably drop in again.",Dave M
50,Never a disappointment!,"I love the Aquarium! It is always educational and inspiring to visit there. In fact, I purchased a membership so I can go any time I would like. The sea horses are always one of the most amazing things to see there. I would highly suggest anyone visiting Southern California making this a ""Must See!"" event. Never fails to thrill and make you fall in love with Nature all over again.",KathyAloha2013
40,Not so large you can't see it all,"Great place to spend 2 to 3 hours -- lots of different exhibit tanks, wide variety of sea creatures, good information cards for each exhibit. Besides the one HUGE multi-story ""fish tank"" opposite the entrance, there are several medium and small tanks, as well as a couple of ""petting tanks"" where anyone (kids and adults) have an opportunity to touch rays, sharks, starfish, etc.We've been to lots of aquariums, and scuba dived and snorkeled all over the world, but still enjoy a couple of hours in a well-presented aquarium such as this one.

Although it was during Christmas week and jammed with families, small children, strollers, it didn't seem overcrowded. There are all the usual exhibits one would expect at an aquarium but the highlight for the 12 year old was touching the rays and sharks. One in particular kept raising its head and she was able to ""pet"" it over and over. It was a memorable experience for her ""it was like a puppy dog!"" So many of the exhibits are interactive. There is much explanatory signage. And a huge staff, positioned to explain and interact with the visitors.",Vacation79402
50,Beautiful and relaxing way to spend your day,"Long Besch Aquarium does not belong to the extraordinarily big places, but is very well kept, and serves its educational purposes. You see all kinds of sea creatures as well as many birds. You can tiuch a little shark and play with a dolphin. Jelly fish are of the extreme beauty. I loved the place, eventhough i have been there before!",786malgorzatac
40,"Perfect It’s Not, But It’s “Shore” to Be a Swimmingly Good Time","With much anticipation, my girlfriend and I recently visited the famed SoCal sea-life exhibit known as the Aquarium of the Pacific (which happens to be celebrating its 20th anniversary this year) in Downtown Long Beach. After parking in a public garage directly across from the building, we made our way past the box office and straight to an automated kiosk (having purchased our tickets online prior to arrival). The process was fast and easy, and so we headed inside where we made sure to grab a Visitor’s Guide (this being our first time there) and were astounded to find a ginormous blue whale hanging from the ceiling (similar to the American Museum of Natural History’s ocean life exhibit in New York City) above the Great Hall (or main lobby).We immediately ran up to the eye-popping Blue Cavern tank which houses all sorts of ocean dwellers, including several giant sea bass. Since we were still downstairs at this point, we decided to venture on into the Southern California/Baja Gallery. The main attraction at this exhibit is a family of seals and ever-playful sea lions.Walking through the gallery, we noticed that stamp stations were conveniently located either next to or near specific exhibits. We soon learned that guests have the opportunity to stamp their Visitor’s Guide as they approach some of the aquarium’s more noteworthy residents.As we made our way through the ever-winding hall, we eventually came to the exit which surprisingly led us to the aquarium’s outdoor activities such as Shark Lagoon (which is home to some rather intimidating carnivorous beasts), the Molina Animal Care Center (complete with a rehabilitation tank and live demonstrations when applicable), Our Water Future (where guests can learn about the consequences of inefficient water usage), the ‘Steelhead Story’ featuring California’s own steelhead and rainbow trout, a number of immersive ‘touch labs’, and lastly, the Lorikeet Forest.Upon entering the Lorikeet Forest, guests are given the option to purchase a cup of nectar to ensure physical (yet harmless) interaction. Naturally we bought a cup and proceeded to walk through the door where we were promptly bombarded by dozens of feathered friends. I personally love aviaries and so this was certainly a special experience for me.After exiting the attraction, we washed our hands (which is highly recommended) and walked upstairs (to the second floor) where we found the popular June Keyes Penguin Habitat. My only gripe with this particular exhibit is that due to the unclear looking glass, it is rather difficult to see them.As we headed back inside, we found ourselves on the upper level of the Southern California/Baja Gallery. We walked back out to the Great Hall and turned left to explore the other two galleries. First up was the Northern Pacific Gallery, which is famously home to sea otters. These energetic creatures garner quite the crowd so guests may have to be patient and wait their turn in order to gain a better vantage point. Other aquatic residents include an octopus, jellies, starfish and tree frogs.Finally we made our way into the Tropical Reef Gallery, which features a sea turtle, a zebra shark, seahorses (both adolescent and adult) and leafy seadragons (my personal favorite).As we walked downstairs, we noticed that a showing of ‘Resilient Cities’ was about to play at the Ocean Science Theater, so we decided to check it out. The screen itself is rotating globe which hangs from the ceiling; this way everyone has a view, regardless of where you are sitting. Shows run approximately five minutes each and are always changing, so ours was one of many.As we exited the theater, we found one of the aquarium’s meet-and-greet characters, a sea lion taking pictures with guests. After the fun photo op, we dared venture into the Pacific Collections Gift Shop which is home to some beautiful and truly unique pieces. We (just barely) managed to escape the shop without breaking the bank and left to enjoy the rest of our day in sunny Long Beach.",Adam Kassel
30,Okay,"There were some interesting displays but sparser than we had hoped. It was quite busy but we did go through rather quickly. Having experienced SeaWorld several times and loving it, this doesn’t compare at all. A good place for a family visit. We wouldn’t go again.",laandrews
50,Fun afternoon,We visited here after our whale watching tour. The aquarium was busy but not so crowded that you couldn't see the exhibits. Ate lunch overlooking the seal show and that was really fun. Liked the sting ray touch pools and the frog exhibits the best. Good for all ages!,Libby H
40,Very nice aquarium!,"It was our first time here and our 2yr old daughters first time at any aquarium.We had a choice to either visit the Santa Monica Aquarium or this one. We chose this one based on other reviews. From what we could gather, the Aquarium of the Pacific has a lot bigger type fishes..which is what we were looking for.We weren't disappointed.They did a real good job. My daughter got a little scared but that's because the fish and other sea creatures were so big😁The staff was very knowledgeable and very friendly.They had a great variety of animals...sharks, sea lions, sea otters, penguins, jelly fish, and numerous other fish.We would definitely recommend this place!",PennStateShah
50,"Beautiful, informative, and well planned","This aquarium has hit the right blend of entertaining and educating. The animal enclosures are all well kept, and everybody appears healthy and neurosis-free. There's the usual problem of not finding ID info for some of the things we saw in the tanks, and not being able to find other animals that were identified, but I guess that's a live collection thing. Well designed interpretive panels, even if a couple were a bit long. Layout of the aquarium is clear and attractive. Nice touch pools. We were there on a weekday, and the crowd was light and lines short. A little disappointed by the retail area, which was entirely for kids. Were looking for some ocean animal books for adults and struck out.",EcoArtTraveler
50,Always a good idea!,My kids love this place! We got the membership this year and go about once every couple of months. Its a bit of a drive for us to get there but once we get there its pretty easy to move around. I normally bring our double stroller to be able to get them in and out of the parking lot more easily and then we parked it inside by the stroller parking area. They have a restaurant that has a view to the Sea lions and we enjoy watching them and the little show they perform while being fed too. And the birds are so much fun too although at least a couple birds like to be on my arms while we carry that cup with nectar for them. I don't like it very much tough but the kids find it awesome. Overall a great place to bring the kids!,Dafne_brazilian
50,Beautiful Aquarium,"My husband and I had visited this aquarium the day after it opened 20 years ago so, of course, we went back. It was beautiful!! Be sure to ask your hotel if they have discount coupons for the place. Our hotel did!! The day we visited, there were lots of children and lots of field trips. Had a great time visiting with the various children and their teachers. Be sure to to to the Aviary where you can buy nectar and the birds come and drink from a cup that you hold in your hands!! Plan to spend about 3 hours.",Arlene402
40,No long lines!,"My husband and I really enjoyed this aquarium it was in walking distance from our hotel.We went on a Thursday and had no problems with seeing all the attractions everything was hands on upclose, some of the staff were very helpful they told us when to go to the next attraction that was helpful, I loved the diver exhibit where the staff was talking to the diver while he was in the tank!! Over the speaker. The jelly fish assortment was breathtaking!",contreras1965
50,Beautiful for private events!,"Attended a private event here and was such a beautiful dinner. Absolutely loved seeing penguins, sharks, rays, and thousands of local marine species in gorgeous displays. Will definitely return soon",Meghan
50,Great Family Fun,We had family come stay with us over Thanksgiving Day and weekend. We planned a couple of different things as they are from out of State and have not been to our area. We made it a complete day trip and were able to get a pay for a combined trip with tour at the Queen Mary. We sure enjoyed the exhibits and Family time together. We loved the fact that we were able to take the bus from the Queen Mary to the Aquarium and back to the Queen Mary. Weather was perfect too!,Christine N
40,Thoroughly enjoyable few hours,"We really enjoyed our visit here, lots to see and do, we were fortunate as it was generally a quiet day. From sea urchins to penguins, this place has it all; you can interact with some of the animals, the staff are very knowledgeable and informative. All in, a very nice visit.",OriginalSoulGirl
40,Visit in the afternoon,"First bit of advice is if you go during the week there will most likely be some sort of field trips there with screaming children. They really can't help themselves. If you want a quieter time go in the afternoon. I spent about 2.5 hours there and saw everything that I wanted to see but had I gone in the afternoon I most likely would have spent a little more time. The aquarium is not the biggest that I have been to but it isn't small either. They have great tanks indoors as well as several things to do outside. There is a jellyfish touch tank, loorikeet cage, shark and ray touch tank. The jellyfish tank was really cool and I was really surprised how they felt. This is a great place for kids with lots of extra things to learn and do along the way. I don't feel like it was a high price because I did a combo ticket with Harbor Breeze whale watching but I have seen people say the price is high. I cannot comment on the food but I would say there are a lot of restaurants just steps from the aquarium so go there instead.",Becky870
50,Wonderful day,amazing wave fish and tropical fish tanks. Could spend the whole day at these two only. If you want relaxed activity this should be your first choice. Please save our oceans!,AlwaysDream
40,Amazing attraction totally spoiled by screeching school kids,"The aquarium has an amazing collection of fish and animals of the Pacific region. I visited on a day when it was pouring with rain in Long Beach so some of the outdoor attractions were given scant attention. I loved the sharks and the huge ray, the sea otters and the massive double height tank where divers feed the fish. It is important that a facility like this is used for education but the place was completely overrun by screeching school kids with ineffective adults flapping around. I paid a lot of money for admission and my expectation is that I can at least see the exhibits. I feel sorry for the fish and animals with kids constantly banging on the tanks. It is true that school parties tend to disappear after lunch so if you have a choice, go in the afternoon.I also visited the Scuba Cafe. The food is horrible- I had the pesto chicken flatbread. It was cold, the cheese was congealed and it was VERY expensive. My advice is take your own food.",Honeypot54321
50,So much to see!,"Amazing thanks, amazing fish. So much to see. Had to walk through it twice. Took over 3 hours. Sea otter show is a must. They even do tricks. If over 3 hours, parking garage ticket can be validated for $8.Recommend downloading map guide. Very organized and diverse. Lots of jellyfish to see and even touch tank on the outside.",Samantha J
40,Rainy day at the Aquarium,We came on a rainy day. All the exhibits were open except the bird area. It was not busy at all. Very enjoyable. The staff were friendly and informative.,Lewy
40,Nice & Fun,"Aquarium of the Pacific is a nice day trip when added to the local shops and seeing the lighthouse. There is a parking structure across the street that you pay for (don't recall how much but they do take cards). It's a pretty busy aquarium (they give lots of coupons away) and there are many different tanks/rooms to visit. When we were there they had scuba divers in the water. They played tic-tac-toe using whiteboards with the kids through the glass and even rock, paper, scissors. There is a lot for kids to explore and it's close to restaurants as well.",Ashley Mantras
50,So much fun!!,"OMG!! So much fun, and so much to do, I didnt want to leave! My boyfriend had to drag me out, lol we will be back for sure!!",Jessica Richardson
40,Nice Aquarium !!,"Aquarium collection is good..We have spent around 3 hrs in here..neatly maintained by the staff..description of the individual displays is nice and worth reading..recommended for kids & families..aquarium is located in a beautiful locality..Collection of soft toys , key-chains etc. at the inside store is good..",Premchand_N
50,Great for a day trip.,There is parking available across the street and the aquarium has a great variety of fish and sea creatures you can pet. It's in a great location and average price of entry.,Charleigh H
40,Great Place to visit,"Following the recommendation of a few local people we elected to visit the Long Beach Aquarium of the Pacific during our stay in L.A. The entry fee was a bit of a shock, $100 U.S for a family of four, food and snacks inside are also a bit pricey. The aquarium itself is fantastic, great displays and lots of interactive activities for the kids. The aquarium is also located in amongst a beautiful boardwalk. Be sure to validate your parking, $8.00 for the day. Overall a great visit and highly recommended for aquarium lovers.",Lou L
50,Best aquarium I've visited so far!,This aquarium was delightful! My husband and I spent around three hours there. We were lucky enough to catch some animals trainings! It was a really fun experience! I'd highly recommend visiting this aquarium!,Kaitlin T
50,Best Aquarium In California,I've been visiting the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach for the past 12 years. The diversity and amounts of tanls and different species of fish is the best that I have ever experienced. Here are what I feel sets this Aquarium apart from all others:-The dolphins and sea lions Tank and walkthrough tube tank that allows them to play with you and your children-The sand shark/stingray petting tanks outside-The exitoc bird experience and feeding the birds-Outside water play area for children (bring dry clothes for your kids to change into afterwards)-The large building high display tanks-Large Shark tank with multiple species of Sharks-The incredible amounts of different species and branches that can take an entire day to walk through and seeI've been to Monterey and that aquarium was good but limited to the fish and species mainly in Monterey Bay. Scripps in SD is excellent but the tanks are miniature. Both are worth a visit but the best in my opinion is The Long Beach Aquarium of the Pacific!,Todd W
50,Our first visit,"I was amazed at the beautiful sea life and git a kick out of the seals, otters, and puffins. Loved watching the kids get so excited about the fish and the touching tanks. Would definitely recommend. It’s smal but packed full of displays and lots of informed volunteers to explain things to you.",Fran N
40,Worth a visit,"One of the best day time things to do on Long Beach.A little expensive but you could spend a couple of hours here.Lots of exhibits. All types of sea life, as well as sea lions, penguins, sea otters and an aviary.Interactive parts to aquarium. Touch rays and sharks and walk through parrot enclosure.Various talks throughout day. Research and book day before to get most of it and deals online.Felt some pools were small for exhibits but not sure if breed and release system is in place.",Ross G
50,A great place to visit for all ages all year round!,Can't wait for the large new addition to the aquarium! A place you will want to visit often. Beautiful exhibits and the animal shows are very entertaining!,lmatteson
50,Different than most - in a good way,"This is not your normal aquarium with toms of fish. Rather it's fish and all the other sea life. Takes about 1 to 2 hours to go through. Parking right across the street has elevators, there is also an elevator inside the aquarium. Helpful hint: you might want to take ear plugs as there will be a lot of excited children. GO EARLY!",iamJohnGalt2
40,Very good to visit.,"It had been a while since I had visited the Aquarium of the Pacific. They have improved it since I visited it last. It is worth the trip. Albeit,it is still second banana to the Monterey Bay Aquarium in Monterey, CA.",Donald C
20,Disappointing experience!,"I really enjoy visiting aquariums and was looking forward to visiting this one. I arrived with my friend just after the aquarium opened at 10AM.On arrival there was lots of work going on to the front entrance area but we had no problems purchasing a ticket and then made our way to the entrance. This aquarium is split into two parts. One is inside and the other outside.We started in the inside section which has lots of nicely presented exhibits with good information.We found it very difficult to see the exhibits as the aquarium was overrun by school children pushing through the other visitors and being very loud. Now I don’t have any issue with school visits etc, however there seemed to be no one keeping an eye on them and the were free to run around without supervision pushing past when we were trying to read about each exhibit.In the end we decided to move to the outside area to hopefully escape the chaos, but disappointedly it was the same story outside. It seemed like no one was interested in the welfare of the animals with all the kids banging on glass and shouting.The aquarium itself is quite small and I felt that the price to get in was a little too much expensive.Overall it was a disappointing experience.",traveladventures1988
40,Worth a visit!,"The Aquarium of the Pacific is probably one of THE best aquariums in the country in my opinion! It has many excellent exhibits (several types of jellyfish which I love), shark and ray pools, and a full sized replica of a blue whale hanging in their lobby! For your travelers, the info desk will keep your luggage for you FOR FREE while you enjoy the aquarium!!It's an inexpensive Uber ride from Carnival or the Queen Mary or you can take the water taxi but it doesn't start until 11:00 a.m.",PaulDeeming
50,Amazing Aquarium,"We really enjoyed our trip to the Aquarium in Long Beach. The exhibits were better than other aquariums I had been to and they had a great variety of wildlife. I'd never been to an aquarium with touch tanks that included small sharks and rays before, and I particularly liked the amount of different jellyfish species they had.The only thing that bothered me was the emphasis they put on the environment and protecting our oceans... for the cafe then to sell apples wrapped in plastic film etc and excessive packaging on other baked goods that didn't need it!",mcglassa
50,Spectacularly eye opening!,"After a Whale watching trip we went next door to the Aquarium . As an aquarium fan I cannot understate the WOW factor and environmental credentials of the place. The coolest things were Jellyfish, Otters and Rays. Often the bigger tanks were on two levels .Divers gave commentaries as they hand fed fish.This is a half day visit place and a great learning place for kids.",Tonyisleham
50,Lots of fun,This is a fun place with lots of areas to go to. It doesn't feel crowded because there are so many tanks and different areas. You can learn or just look. My 6 year old loved and us adults did too.,elwarriner
40,Good day out,"Whilst on holiday visiting family we went to long beach and visited the Aquarium, lovely place and plenty to look at, very entertaining for the children and also lovely to see for the adults. Definitely recommended to visit.",willos1
40,"Kind of small, but still fun to visit","Not a huge aquarium, but it had great jellyfish exhibits, and the cutest sea otters. They were so playful! They also had an outdoor ray and shark exhibit where they let you interact with the sharks and rays. We got there about 50 minutes before their 5:00 PM closing, so we didn’t really get to explore everything, but the ray and shark encounter was open until 9:00, so we didn’t have any problem seeing them.",mom32051
50,Great Aquarium,"Very nice facility. Lots of hands on opportunities and many things to see learn and take part in. The seals and sea lions were fun to watch swim, and I think 1 waved every time he came by. The otters were a real hoot to watch as well. This place is fun for all ages and all family members.",Roger25375
40,"Good, but rushed, visit","We didn’t do the Aquarium justice since we had less than 2 hours for our visit. But the array of animals and sea life were amazing. I like that it goes beyond fish - to marine birds and mammals - that captures the whole environment. Natalie, at the ticket window, was just great as she helped us navigate what to do with such a short visit.",Julie F
50,Lots of fun for kids and adults.,"Just purchased an inexpensive annual pass for my family and grand-kids. They love this much more than the Zoo. The variety of animals and sea life is amazing. There are so many hands on things for kids to do. The design of the facility makes it all so interactive. The environment is so much cleaner than going to a dirty dusty zoo. For people living in the south-bay, its so much easier to get to the aquarium than the LA zoo. The whole area has been upgraded by the city of Long Beach. There is plenty of parking, lots of restaurants and the Queen Mary is close by.",berniek1949
50,WOW!!! You will LOVE this aquarium !,"From the huge mother and baby whale hanging over your head when you enter, to the many, many forms of sea life that are featured here, from polar bears to the penguins, this place will dazzle you, not to mention the kids !!!",ladybrady007
30,Many species on display,The aquarium has a lot of fish tanks with many exhibits.There are some pools with Mantas which kids can pet.The large whale model which is hanged in the museum main lobby is VERY impressive.,Danny_1957
40,"Nice layout, but could have more information","Enjoyed our visit there, plenty to see and the layout is nice. We would have like to see more information available (what you see, names etc). Where there were docents present (hands on displays like starfish tank, shark lagoon), the information was great and personal. Movie theatre was reserved for school groups, so we couldn't get in. It can get a bit noisy in the halls when school groups get all excited about what they see. :-)",gcto20
30,Small aquarium,This is a small aquarium and just average. I didn’t feel like it was worth the admission price. They did have an above average number of different types of jellyfish and different types of rays and stingrays. They also had a very large penguin attraction and you were able to see quite a few close up.,LTay1234
10,Tragic,"Waaaaayy too many touch tanks! While it may be beneficial and educational for very young children. I was saddened to find the small and blank condition of the tanks and how many touch tanks there are. Making it clear that it is focused more on entertainment than quality of life for the animals.In many of the tanks animals are not given privacy or a break from the constant poking and prodding of little fingers, which is harmful and stressful to the animal. I was saddened by the quality of life the animals experience. Especially the seal lions and seals living in captivity literally feet away from their wild harbor inhabiting counterparts.If you want to see seals simply walk around the harbor and watch them swimming around happy and free.I was informed by the stationed employee that the moon jellyfish in the touch tank live 2-3months and it is most likely “shorter” in the wild. Upon looking it up, I discovered their life expectancy is a year in the wild.While it maybe tempting getting the chance to see these animals up close, it is much more satisfying seeing them free in the wild. Take your kids to see real tide pools such as in Laguna or Aliso Beach where educators from Crystal Cove Conservancy are often stationed to protect and educator on the wildlife there.Keep our wildlife wild. Consider the life of the animal. Expose you kids to the wild and real nature not this sad imitation. Don’t fall into the tempting trap of supporting animal captivity as I did. :(",ejanehoffman19
50,Great Morning,Very well laid out aquarium with a lot to see. Really enjoyed the sea lion and seal show despite it being crowded. Liked the outdoor exhibits such as the penguins. The indoor area was well spaced out and like the sea otters and jellyfish display. All the staff were both knowledgeable and friendly. Used AAA discount which was 10% off I believe. Validate your parking then you can stay all day in the lot and take the free shuttle around town. Good way to spend a few hours. Moderately expensive though.,avgjoey
40,Aquarium of the Pacific,Beautiful tanks. A lot of touch tanks. Choose time of arrival carefully as schools visit almost daily. Mid to late afternoon is best. Great selection of various jellyfish and seahorse tanks!,Kerry B
40,Great for a one time visit,"We went to the Aquarium on one of the colder days during our weekend trip to Seal beach. My kids loved touching the jelly fish, sharks and stingrays. It was big enough to spend about 2-2.5 hours there, but not more than that. The sea-lion show was great- the seal lions do tricks and show their personality. :) The ""Animal Meet and greet"", however was lame. They brought out a rat and talked about him. That was it. Couldn't touch him, just look at him. A rat was the last animal I was expecting to ""meet"" at an aquarium!! They also have a demonstration in the otter tank but we missed that one.I would never pay full price for this Aquarium. We got discount tickets from our hotel, and it was less than $100 for our family of 5.",Elissa J
40,Great experience but very busy and over crowded,awesome to view everything but I found the school groups and crowds a bit much and it meant that we couldn't see things well at times. It was good to see everything though and well worth visiting,Sonja I
40,Great,We enjoyed our visit very much! It was all very exciting! My husband was a bit disappointed he didn't get to see any larger sharks. It was very busy and crowded but we managed our way around to see everything.,JenV
50,Great experience for whole family,"Hands on with many different animals and great displays of others. The sea lions and seals were kids favorite. Mine was the sea otters. The bird exhibit was fantastic, they land on you and check you out for food. This is a great place to bring out of town visitors. Lots of educational displays on California and the western US animals.",timg742

40,Aquarium of the Pacific,"Just made my first trip to the Aquarium of the Pacific. I was somewhat disappointed due to the cost to enter and for what was experienced. Yes, I enjoyed taking photos and the shark exhibit is very good, but don't expect it to be like Sea World. Most of the exhibits are inside in aquarium type settings. There were a lot of smaller children present from schools and the crowd in, so we had to back-track some to see everything.",karenhB3777MW

They stand on your shoulder or hand and they suck the drink out of the cup "" $4""It is not a big place, I think 2 or 3 hours should be enough.",Hany G

50,beautiful,This was a beautiful aquarium. The facility was very clean an the staff helpful and informative. We were visiting from the east coast and our children enjoyed seeing sea life they had never seen before. The displays were beautiful and even on a Saturday it was not overly crowded. We very much enjoyed our visit.,JLJTiverton
40,Nice Venue for Event,"Here for a reception for a confernce. Very nice venue to relax and njoy networking. Staff attempted to tell us where the penguins are located; however, we never found them. I was however, crowded.We enjoyed walking abound and viewing frogs and fish. However, I must say, not the best aqarium I've seen. Since my admision was free, I won't speak to the value of exhibits. If visiting solo or with family, a guided or audio tour would have enhanced, expecially at almost $30 per person.Food served and drinks were good; not sure who catered the event. I really enjoy events in venues that have not only opportunities to network, but give a flavor of the place you are visiting. Focusing on the Pacific was nice.",Pat B
50,Enjoyable and educational!,"I enjoyed the variety of jellyfish, very beautiful displays. This aquarium is smaller than others I’ve visited but has a more personal, caring feeling overall from the exhibits to the staff. I especially enjoyed the sting ray, tide pool, leopard shark touch pools. The staff are very nice and very informative about all the marine life! My husband and I had a great time visiting!",Kelly S

30,It’s pricey,I don’t get why the aquarium is sooo expensive when you have to do all the work. An adult ticket is $30 and all you get to do is walk and stare at fish. At least Sea World has rides. And then you pay $6-8 for parking. This was supposed to be a inexpensive get out the house trip for my girls but it got pricey quick. The only good thing was the gift shop had some reasonable prices.,lailasmom1223
50,Best aquarium in the US,"Having been to all the major aquariums, this is the winner. It's well designed, easy to navigate, and full of colorful displays of species you won't find in most aquariums. Recommend a half day and you could spend more.","Double ""Ollie"" Winner"
50,Summer nights at the Aquarium,"We love adventuring at the Aquarium of the Pacific, so many things to see! Long Beach is one of the nicest cities in Los Angeles to visit and there are a lot of activities, shopping, boat tours and dining in the area of the Aquarium of the Pacific.During select evenings, you have a chance to enter the aquarium after normal closing hours to see the exhibits and interact with the animals in the touch pools. Since the animals are more active after sun set, its a whole new experience! The shark and stingray touch pools are a great place to relax and watch the sun set, look for the fish that's not a fish...its worth asking the guides!We especially enjoy grabbing a snack and sitting at one of the many comfy areas and watching the larger tanks. With so many exhibits to see, and truly spend time watching the interaction between the fish, your hard pressed to make it through in a few hours.Learning about the different ecosystems, talking to the guides and watching nature at the Aquarium is one of our family's favorite secret LA destinations",AlyTayHayAlex
50,So much fun!,This was a great aquarium. We loved the touch pools. My favorite was the anemone and urchin touch pools. I haven't seen that type of touch pool offered except at the New Jersey aquarium. I was really excited that this place had it. We did the lorikeet bird feeding. Its $4 for each little food cup. It's a fun experience. I love all types of marine and animal life so I loved all the exhibits. Would definitely return.,Wandering To Wonder
50,Don't Miss This Adventure!,"The Aquarium of the Pacific is filled with wonderful sea critters, a host of knowledge docents, and great educational material for people of all ages. Children, adults and seniors can find a lot to do and learn from this wonderful place.",Fearless730216
40,Night Dive,"I was pleasantly surprised by this venue, and the variety of exhibits. The way the Aquarium is divided by location, which gives the patron a near idea of the diversity of different places.I found the jellyfish, seahorses and otters to be especially fun exhibits. The giant spider crabs are a fun surprise too! There are also hands on shark and ray tanks.""Night Dive"" was a lot of fun. The Aquarium displayed art, and had dj's and live bands playing. There were cash bars on-site and food trucks as well.The patrons were having a great time, but I didn't see any destructive or disrespectful behavior to exhibits or aquatic life.",Snellerelli
50,Amazing Experience!,Entering the aquarium means Enter in a magic underwater place. So much different kind of species and so much to see! If you stay in LOng Beach a visit to the aquarium is compulsory! Wonderful Experience!,ilduovagabondo
50,Never gets old,"We love coming here and bring all out of town guests if we can. If kids are off, it will be busy but its worth the crowds.",bcrock
50,A great time for 3 generations,"Ended up getting a family membership plus a day ticket for me. To get a day ticket would have cost us $150 plus more for a 4 year old. Getting a ticket for me and a family membership cost $159. Now the family can return cost free. Although it was hot and crowded everyone had a great time just viewing indoor sites, leaving the outdoor stuff for a cooler day. The kids loved it when they saw a scuba diver ""fish"" feeding the regular occupants of the tank. Also getting parking ticket validated prior to leaving cost us only $8 for 6 hours of parking.",stephen710
40,It was nice. I wouldn't recommend to go on there busy day,I like it but we when on sunday. I wish we didnt go just before school started. The Less of crowded the better would to see everything take you time and relaxed enjoy all the sea life they ofter. I was super surprise the food was is very good. I have the tuna melt. It was alots better then Disneyland.,JayMarie
50,Wow!,"A terrific collection of sea life from around the world! So beautiful and - - weird? - - exotic, gathered into specific collections and well-designed glass-front aquariums. Even ""petting zoos"" of underwater widllife! Catch the shows, too! Spend the day with the entire family.",Bob C
50,Great way to spend a day.,"Hard to go wrong with an aquarium. We found a Facebook deal and got 2 for 1. Had a great day, just lazily strolling along. Amazing exhibits, lots of neat little ocean creatures. Well worth the time and money.",TTzz
40,Great 1/2 day entertainment,"I was in Anaheim for a conference at Disneyland. Having never visited Long Beach and arriving a day early, I decided to look for a fun diversion from the typical LA attractions.Aquarium of the Pacific was just what the doctor ordered. From the adorable penguins to the magnificent life-size blue whale model hanging from the ceiling, the Aquarium is a must-sea (get it?) if you’re in Orange County. There are plenty of exhibits for people of all ages. Kids and adults alike will love the stingray touch tanks. There’s a live scuba dive demonstration with one of the Aquarium’s volunteer scientists. The shark tank is not to be missed!Get your hand stamped on the way out so you can enjoy lunch at Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, Chili’s, or Hooters. All three are within walking distance and then you can then go back into the Aquarium for free to catch whatever you missed when the crowds start to decrease.The Aquarium will validate your garage parking, giving you a small savings. For a BIG savings, AAA members can visit any of the local offices and pre-purchase tickets. I believe the savings was around $8 per person.If you’re looking for a 1/2 day experience in Orange County and you love science, animals, or the ocean, make sure that Aquarium of the Pacific is on your list.My only concern was the large number of parents who allowed their children to run wild and interrupt some of the presentations. Hopefully that was a one-time occurrence and definitely not the fault of the Aquarium.",Danny S
50,Never knew,Grew up in so val and I have never been there. I decided to take my kids day memorial day and I could not be happier. We all loved it. I really have no complaints about anything there. I do reccomend you buy your tickets online as the ticket booth lines are long. They have so much sea life and there is staff always close by if you have a question. We will definitely be going back. I was very impressed,Deepsteve1
50,Family Visit,"Came out to California from St Augustine Florida to visit my son, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter, we went out to the Aquarium of the Pacific today with my 17 month old granddaughter and she absolutely loved it. Had lunch in their Cafe. Excellent! Place was overrun with children and strollers but typical of a holiday weekend. It is absolutely fabulous and it is definitely a must-see must-do if you're in the Long Beach California area.",Cliff Shields
50,"Grandson loves the Aquarium, we are members. Been there, will be back!","This a a wonderful place to Sea Life, thanks guys! See it all Sharks, Rays, Otters, Giant Sea Bass, Electric Eels, and much, much more.",J Peter W
50,Superb in every way possible,"This is an absolute must place to visit,it caters for all ages with hands on touching of rays and sharks..yes..sharks. Beautiful lay outs with lots of information, it displayed what little we know about what lies under the ocean with creatures we have never seen before. Do is and drinks can be a little costly but we took our own in with no questions asked. The staff were polite and knowledgeable. Excellent visit.",andrew p
50,Brilliant,Wish we could have spent more time here. There is an enormous tank/aquarium where a diver was inside talking to a person on the outside explaining what going on. Wish I could have stayed longer.,Mrs Dawn Heathe... R
50,Surround Yourself With Sea Life From Around The Planet,"If you live in close proximity of Long Beach, I highly recommend purchasing an annual pass. Though most of the exhibits can be viewed in on day, spending time with the touch tanks--including sharks!--and watching the staff give behind the scenes presentations is worth the price of admission. Stay for lunch at the cafe, stop at the unique gift shop and make sure you take children of any age with you. Highly educational exhibits are in place with new rotations of species throughout the year. The building is two stories to make way for the international displays. One of the largest displays is a tank that spans a wall as tall as both floors. Divers enter the tank to interact with the huge sea creatures as well as to hand feed them. Make sure to watch the movies in a separate mini-theater to help improve your comprehension of conservation needs.",Rose H
50,Great Day at the Aquarium Pacific,"A good attraction for families, Enjoyed our visit and easily could do this attraction in 2-3 hours so you can also plan for other attractions during the same day. Great friendly staff. Would deffo return",Daniel186334
50,A wonderful family outing,We love this aquarium. It’s in a beautiful location and has an indoor/outdoor set up to enjoy the weather year round. My mother in law was visiting California from out of state and this was one of the outings that she really enjoyed. The kids love the touch tanks and seeing the unique coral and reef life. Definitely worth the visit.,Jennifer B
30,Good for a short visit,"Something to do if you have out of town visitors with small children, especially on a hot Summer day. Big enough to be interesting to kids but not so big that it can’t be done in a couple of hours.",K T
50,AWESOME!,"We’ve been to a fair number of aquariums in the U.S. and elsewhere, and the Aquarium of the Pacific in downtown Long Beach can hold its own with the best of them. In addition to fish of every size and hue, there’s a fine representation of aquatic mammals, from otters to dolphins, as well as aquatic flora from the world over Our favorite among its many attractions was a coral reef exhibit with its spectacular array of color and biodiversity – check out the leafy dragonfish, which we’ve never seen elsewhere. An excellent gift shop is on the premises, as are several restaurants and snack bars.One cautionary note: the Aquarium is extremely popular and can be thronged, especially on weekends (we went on a Sunday). If you have trouble with crowds, you should go on a weekday, and even then it may be packed. The crowds and bustle notwithstanding, though, it’s definitely worth the trouble.",RGinCT
50,Half off evenings,"I love this aquarium! It's small but lovely and in the summer they some have half priced evenings, perfect activity before dinner!",Destini K
50,"Fascinating, Fun, great day trip!!","Everyone, from grandparents to pre schoolers loved experiencing the grand scope of the 2 story ocean tanks, with scuba divers giving talks..while under water and feeding the fish,to the touching tanks of moon jelly fish and the touching shallow ponds of sting rays and small sharks. So much to see and experience! Give yourselves a full day!. We always enjoy the cafeteria upstairs for lunch..",Candice H
50,One of the best aquariums,"This is a great place to spend several hours. There’s a late variety of sea life and the ability to get personal and touch some of them is a big hit with my toddler. It’s now her preferred place over Disneyland. You can touch sting rays, sharks, moon jelly, feed the birds, and so many other things to do. Tip - there’s parking in the back if the structure is full.",nik t
50,Lovely aquarium,"I thoroughly enjoyed going round this museum. It was very educational and nice to see the staff so caring and knowledgeable about the animals. As someone who is very against places like Sea World, I was slightly sceptical about this place but it was very worth the money and the whole day was very enjoyable. The touching pools are well maintained and staff are so attentive. This really stuck in my head about my trip to California and it is something I have recommended to a number of friends who have visited the states since!",Hollayveepond
50,Night Dive at the Aquarium!,"The Aquarium does this event six times a year and it is a blast! Over 21 only so that means cocktails, great music all over the place and food trucks if you're hungry. The whole Aquarium is open and it was fun to walk around checking out the exhibits after hours. The Penguins just look at you like you are interrupting their rest and you think they are wondering what people are doing there so late. Really, really fun!",sclarebeck
40,Nice aquarium,"I appreciate nice and interesting aquariums and try to visit them when I am in different cities. The Aquarium of the Pacific is a nice, small aquarium. It is not as big as some, but what it lacks in size it makes up for in it's appearance. Nice exhibits, well maintained, clean, overall a nice aquarium.",jasonmQ9692YF
40,Great,"Great museum and a good place to go with children. A lot of touching (jellys, sharks and so on).Both outdoor and indoor. We walked the museum before a whalewatching cruise from the harbour next door.",Diskolydia
50,Great family day out,"We combined our visit here with the Queen Mary tour and it works out a lot less expensive.We got to see penguin chicks close up, stroke rays and starfish. There is lots to see and do for all ages, also educationally beneficial as well as tactile experiences.All in all this is a great family day out!",Gill2602
40,Fun Place,"We did a package deal with the Queen Mary, the shuttle picks you up and drops you off at the Aquarium. We had a lot of fun! their displays were broken up by regions.",Cindy S
50,Jellyfish!,"I loved being able to pet jellyfish here - I've never had that experience at another aquarium. They also did feedings for the rays/small sharks that you get to pet, which was awesome. Very well laid out and great exhibits. I also paid extra for the whale watching tour. Keep in mind that you will want to bring cash if you want any snacks/drinks on the boat, they don't accept credit/debit cards. Didn't see any whales, but saw quite a few dolphins! I would definitely do it again. Make sure to bring sunscreen (b/c even though it will feel quite cool on the water, you will get plenty of sun!)",AmettOmega
50,Excellent Aquarium,"Young or old--this aquarium has something for everyone. It is quite large, well planned out. There are live seal shows--feeding them and talking about them. There are lots of exhibits spread out in large walkways so it doesn't seem to be crowded. There are all types of sea life shown. Nice explanatory pictures showing you what is inside the different tanks. Very nice.",Jane263
50,The harbor cruise is a MUST!!!!,"Loved being able to touch the rays and jelly fish. Two 3D movies. Lots of different tours to choose from. The harbor cruise is a MUST!!! You see the Queen Mary. They guides explain lots of information that you would not otherwise learn....disguised oil rigs designed by Disney. They take your picture before boarding so don't forget to go by the kiosk to get your pic. It is so nice to sit on the boat looking at the ocean and having a cold beer. When your cruise is finished, have lunch at Bubba Gump!! Nice day!!! Ride the Long Beach Passport for free to the Queen Mary or to go to the ferry to go to Catalina Island.",JamieKaye
40,Very interactive and interesting,Great day out for all the family. It's interactive and informative. I got to feed the stingrays and the parrots. I even stroked a shark. Kids will love it,Clare N
40,Decent aquarium for the size,"My family enjoyed seeing all the animals and taking the extra harbor cruise. The otters and puffins are our favorite exhibits. However, the space was crowded and lacked direction and flow.",NH5Miles
50,Family holiday,"Wow, what a day!!! We have had one of the best days here. The sea lion/seal experienceIs amazing. We learnt so much from the tour of the aquarium, it was so informative. And meeting Harpo was a memory making experience. Loved it!!! We have learnt so much from here. Thank you.",EMPrice76
40,Great to see the updates coming along.,"This is a nice aquarium for California. I have been to the Atlanta, Georgia Aquarium and nothing comes close to it. The main tank is an aww inspiring sight and the sea creatures are twice the size of what I saw here. Photos don’t do it Justice. This aquarium is cheaper for admission than the Atlanta aquarium.",Chase Carver
40,Nice Aquarium in a great area,"This Aquarium can be visited in just a few hours and you can see so many awesome things! It is uniquely designed and a bit confusing to navigate. I do like howanimals are grouped by area of the world. I also liked that it is both indoor and outdoor. The area near the aquarium is great for walking around and includes a park, restaurants, and shopping.",Brooke N
40,Nice outing on a hot day,"I have been here many times with grandchildren. I like others wish it were a little bigger and not so crowded.Today there were many schools having field trips and I counted 21 young, under 5 years old with only 3 adults. When children do not have adults they push and shove their way to the front.There are many things to see, mostly things to do with the Pacific Ocean and the rivers that feed them.It is fun to see things we would never see except at an aquarium, sea horses, spider crabs, dragon fish, and a few others we hope not to see while in our local waters :-).People who work there are very nice and knowledgable, many are volunteers.Price could be a little less just because of the size and when I am spending money to get into an attraction, lose the parking fee.",grpandnana
30,"OK Aquarium, nothing special.",We recently visited with my 2 grade school kids. The aquarium is just ok in my opinion. There are way better aquariums out there. Overpriced for the amount of things to do and way overcrowded. We had a half day to do something and we were able to see everything easily in that time. Kids were very disappointed in the “prize” for getting all the pages in the book stamped. Make sure to get your parking ticked scanned before you leave the building so parking is only $8.00.,David1977kc
40,Enjoyed very much!,We really love the fact that this is more of a educational experience. Some of the tanks were just breathtaking!!,Deanna D
50,Great fun with kids,Lots of fun for all ages. My 3 year old girl loved touching the rays and shark. it was lots fo fun with a well organized and great venue.,MarcelU1968
40,Very cool experience and lots to see here!,My family had so much fun here. They experienced for the first time touching sting rays and sharks. The penguins and seals you could sit and watch all day they were awesome. We watched and learned about jellyfish which was fascinating. Lots to see here and occupy your kids time with. Definitely should experience this once at least.,vegasexec
50,Must visit once atleast,"It was superb...had been there for the first time was really nice...worth visiting..but do not forget to collect the guide brochure, collect before u enter the main gate..it has timings n hall info..a must if Ur visiting for the first time.",Pooja S
50,NOT To be Missed,"My wife and I have (in the past) been members of the Aquarium. It is world-class all the way and should be on your list of places to visit if in Southern California. There is plenty to see and do for an individual, couple, or families. Very informative and entertaining in all aspects! Their food, as would be expected, is a little pricey but is very good!",Rich W
50,Great place,"Wonderful place to see. If on a budget you can get a combined ticket to see the Queen Mary ship, docked right there in the same area, and also tickets to the aquarium. Great vacation spot with all shopping and restaurants close by at Rainbow Harbor in Queens Way Bay",Darin F
50,our visit to the Aquarium of the Pacific,"This was my husbands and my second visit to the aquarium but the first with my other family members. We had adults, teens, 9 year old and a toddler. Everyone in the family had a something they liked from the large aquarium tanks to the seals. One big hit was being able to touch the rays and the moon jelly fish. The toddler was mesmerized by all the fish swimming by. My seventeen year old granddaughter is very interested in marine biology and really had a great time. Nice parking garage and discount if you have you ticket validated at the aquarium. had nice area outside the aquarium to eat our lunch",gemini49_jp
50,Fun Indoor Activity For Any Age,"Within walking distance to other popular Long Beach attractions. Nearby attractions include The Queen Mary, Harbor Tours, and the Pike Place Mall. Look on the Aquarium website for discounted rates if you plan on visiting any of the other nearby attractions.The aquarium has both indoor and outdoor exhibits. For children, there is a lot of fun activities such as pet the jellyfish and sharks exhibit and education diagrams. There are three cafes inside the aquarium. One of the cafes sold mostly sweet bread and coffee. Cafe scuba is the other two cafes located on the first and second floor. The cafe has more of a variety of drinks ( $3 - $10) and food ($7.50+) selections. The cafe offers an indoor and outdoor seating area with plenty of seating.Garage parking is available for $9. Don't forget to get your parking ticketing validated before you leave the aquarium. Wear comfortable, closed-toe shoes because of the strollers and little kids running around.Outside of the aquarium, there are plenty of restaurants and other activities to enjoy. In front of the Pike Place Mall, there's a Ferris wheel and also a bungee trampoline activity.",Erica Dozier
50,"Very nice, and affordable considering it's an aquarium","I've loved this aquarium since I was little. Always something to see. The ""habitats"" look very well maintained, as do the grounds overall. For the area, and for an aquarium in general, the price is extremely cheap as well, being as there is so much to see!",Britt
40,Small Aquarium,"If you’re planning a trip to the Aquarium of the Pacific, especially for a family outing, it’s going to be pretty pricey. I decided to pay for a family membership with a free guest pass. It came out to about 189. And payed 20$ for the parking pass option (5 or 6 free passes) my family and I were done within 2 hours (I have an insane toddler who cannot stop moving). I probably went there about 4 times the entire year (prefer more outdoor areas) so I discontinued my membership.It’s a really nice center and contains a splash pad for the little ones to play. My little guy only wants to stay in this area to either run through the sprinklers or get soaked touching the sharks.As before mentioned, small area. Lots of moms take their kiddos during the year and the aquarium offers tons of events for members that are pretty cool. Just not of interest to me.Tip: pack lunch. The cafe food is meh. You can eat outside the building or right outside the second floor is a balcony patio area that wasn’t too crowded. I saw more employees lounging there than patrons, so it was a little more quiet.Avoid weekends and call ahead to see if there are school trips scheduled.",Sundina
50,All Long Beach residents should be members,"We have been annual cardholders here for years. It is an incredible value. Key tip: come at opening if you have small children. During the summertime this place gets swarmed by summer camps and tourists by 11ish. If you come in the morning you can enjoy all the fish with virtually no one around, and it is much easier to keep an eye on the munchkins while still giving them freedom to roam about.My daughter loves the others!",C H
50,Love Aquariums,"This is one of the best aquariums I have had the pleasure of visiting. Lots of hands on interactive exhibits. Multiple shows going on. I have to say my favorite thing was the lorikeets. Pay the $4 and get some nectar it was so much fun having the birds hop on you and drink it. That was truly he highlight of my visit. This Aquarium truly seemed to have it all, with marine animals from all over. The seals and sea lions did not disappoint, and the sea otters were a blast to watch as were all the others. 4D movie was also very cute and the best 3D I have seen in years. I would recommend going early enough to have time to see everything, and it can be a little busy so it would be nice not to be in a rush, and take in all this place has to offer",Harvey G
40,Nice Aquarium,"We took in the Aquarium of the Pacific while visiting Long Beach. The walk over was nice, and once inside, we saw a lot of fish. And frogs. And turtles. And rays. And Seals.The Seal and Otter show was pretty good. Tip: Get there and sit down at least 15 to 20 minutes prior to the show. Seating is limited, and once filled, well, you aren't seeing the show. Bring a drink, and find a shady spot. (Helpful, right?)There are elevators for those who can't do ramps and stairs. The place is well-cooled and was a place to spend an enjoyable afternoon.",AvWriter
40,Crowded but very cool,"Artists will find much color and form inspiration here. We visited on a summer Saturday - not the smartest time to go if you don't prefer crowds of families with strollers. Even so, toured the two second floor sections - Northwest Pacific and Tropical. This aquarium features separate areas of the entire Pacific, not just the California coast. Start upstairs if you prefer less crowds. Plenty of interactive learning opportunities. Ask the staff at the tide pool exhibit where you can ""hug"" a sea urchin! Otters are adorable. So great to see everything up close. Bring a jacket or sweater and adults, take some comfort in that you can walk around with a beer from the cafe. Looking forward to seeing the renovations.",Maggers
30,Great place for children,"Notice the title of my review. Although it truly is a wonderful place to visit, it seems to be geared more specifically to children and school field trips. Yes, there are wonderful displays, but there are literally tons of groups of children, so it's difficult to get too close to those displays.",jbach1021
40,Good exhibits and talks,"Aquarium of the Pacific offers good exhibit spaces covering a few different regions of oceanic life. Although it’s not my favorite aquarium it still is a nice place to visit. It would be better if some of the enclosures were bigger especially since Southern California should be able to fund a top of the line aquarium.Although they attempt to educate through interactive displays and talks, I feel some areas could be improved. Also, the docents should be given more authority insure guests are not breaking rules, especially those designed to protect the fish.Parking is $8 with validation. Plenty of restaurants around for a meal, including one inside the Aquarium.",Bubuflu
40,Great Exhibits,"This was my first time going to an aquarium in general in years and this location was a great first going back. The price decent and my boyfriend and I went during the week in May. The exhibits was very hands on, my favorite was being able to touch the jelly fish (they don't sting). We also got to enjoy the sea lion feeding and shark feeding. This aquarium is a great date spot and also great for families with young children. They had a lot of play areas for them and mini educational lessons that were happening at certain locations.",beccabunny0
50,WOW!!,"The AOP (AQUARIUM OF THE PACIFIC).Is a VERY COOL place. To, check out the LIVES,that live under the water.Also, we can see the creatures; upclose and personal!! I ABSOLUTELYRECOMMEND the AOP, to everyone.",OGskeet
50,Awesome place!,"One of the better aquariums I’ve seen after the few big ones on the east coast. The sea otters, sea lions, sea turtles, and rays are all incredible to behold.",Jon R
40,Day with the grandkids,"The aquarium is small enough to spend a couple of hours with the grandkids. Touching the sharks, manta rays and feeding the birds are a must. Not too expensive. 35.00 for me and my two grandkids. Brought our own lunch where we ate in the picnic area. Parking is validated by the aquarium. Spent the morning here the. Swimming at the Belmont pool where swimming for kids is free. Great day",JuanitaB0nita
50,"Great for entertainment, special events and learning","We have watched it grow and add venues. As a former diver, it brings back good memories. We always learn something new. The little ones especially enjoy the tough tanks. The café food is reasonable Summer months have lots of young children visiting, but the groups usually leave by midafternoon.",wanderingone2018
50,LB Aquarium,"The Long Beach Aquarium of the Pacific is great. I have been here many times with my own kids and on field trips with kindergarten and second graders. It is a nice size, not to small and not to big. It has much to do!",Jennifer R
40,Fishy Fun,"We took our 3 1/2 year old grandson here and all of us had a great time. He loves the zoo, so seeing fish and sea life was a treat. We bought tickets in advance and printed tickets at home to skip the line to buy tickets there. We arrived right at opening to beat some of the crowds that kept building as the day continued. We were only there about 2 hours before the crowds and the noise got to be too much and our energy got too low. The exhibits were great and the staff and volunteers were helpful in explaining more about the displays. Despite the crowds and the strollers, you could usually get a close enough view of everything for it to be fun for little ones. One major disappointment, however, was their cafe. It was not clear that there were two areas to order that each served different things, plus the menu is on a screen that changes every few seconds so it is hard to quickly/easily evaluate the entire menu. The food is expensive and the cafe was extremely noisy, so it was not really a retreat to go to recharge. With as busy as they are, everything stays clean and most items were in good working order. This really is a great place for kids to learn about and enjoy ocean critters.",Paula B
50,Great exhibits and nice size,"We were very pleased with this, our very first visit to the Aquarium of the Pacific. The informational talks were very good and there wasn't so much to see that we were overwhelmed with trying to fit it all in. Of course, the sea otters are a favorite. They are so cute. And we had a ""private"" show at the sea lion exhibit when the mammalogist brought the sea lion right up on the rocks near the top of the enclosure where we were just inches away from seeing the sea lion go through all his ""tricks."" The prices in the cafe and gift shop were very reasonable, which was a welcome change from so many other ""entertainment"" venues. We visited on the 4th of July, and the crowd was pretty light until around 3 PM when more people started arriving. Perhaps they were intending to stay for the fireworks later that evening since the aquarium was open until 10 and was supposed to be a great place for viewing them. At any rate, we really enjoyed the day and look forward to coming back again.",VtaTraveler
40,Super cute and interactive!,This aquarium starts off indoors and has exhibits outside also. So many different species and knowledgeable staff! Really enjoyed the volunteens giving information and displaying hands on exhibits!,Samantha M
30,Visited on a free day during a convention,We went here on a Sunday afternoon - and it was packed. It is a great place for small children. As an adult it was nice to see the seals and sea lions but there was not much else for adults.,My3kidsmd
40,interesting place,"We spent about 3 and 1/2 hours going through the aquarium. They have some interesting sea creatures that we have not seen at other aquariums. We even got to touch a jelly fish!!! We have touched a lot of other creatures at other places but never a jelly fish. There are a lot of workers and volunteers there to give helpful information about the sea creatures. They even have a Lorikeet feeding area, which is different. There are places to eat there and make certain they validate your parking ticket, other wise it might cost you more than $8.00 for your time there and you pay at the kiosk before you go into the garage to get your car. You can go outside and take a small hike to see the light house down the way and the bay area with the Queen Mary across it. There are some very interesting pictures on the bottom of the light house that show Long Beach in the early 1900's, there is also a ship steering wheel that little kids might find interesting along the path coming back in the sand dunes they have made. They do sell pictures to you on a green screen backing for not a bad price. I got a discount for looking at Long Beach online of their website, it was about $8.00 per person, they do give discounts to 62 and older.",catsmarty
30,Worth the price but average,"I’ve been to several other aquariums in the past and Aquarium of the Pacific was not the best - not even close. The price of admission is worth the experience though. Local schools often bring their classes to this attraction and this makes it extremely hard for tourists to see the fish and what have you when you have a row of twenty children in front of the glass. If possible, go during a slower day for best results.",Titan Thompson
30,could be better,interesting exhibits available but was expecting more. daughter had fun. not as many exhibits when compared to some of the other aquariums that we went to.,marilyne2375
50,The Best Place to Take the Kids,"This was a wonderful aquarium full of marine life that I never thought that I would ever see. What I also love about this aquarium is the variety of touch pools. The kids could pet sharks, rays, horseshoe crabs, moon jellies, and tide animals.",Kristina G
40,Incredible,"I grew up in the area and this attraction was a great addition to the Long Beach area. Crazy world we live in and if you dont believe me, just look at some of the creatures living there!Great place on a hot day!Lots to do in the area now.Find coupons and its well worth a visit!",Leanne J
40,Nice Aquarium,Impromptu visit to the aquarium while visiting So Cal this summer. Really enjoyed the exhibits. Fun place to visit and learn a little something too.,luvoc11
40,Worth the Visit!,"Kids loved it and the feeding times SO interesting. Food for humans good too.Two negatives: better not go on weekends, especially during summer. Large crowds! Their parking lot full. $15.00 across street.Just pick your time, go and enjoy!",sherrym278
50,Great Aquarium,"This is a great aquarium with a knowledgeable staff. Some aquariums do not focus on education and just house animals but not Aquarium of the Pacific. This place is educational for adults and children. They have great displays, information, and responsible touch tanks. Do not go to Long Beach without an adventure to the aquarium.",GLG3
50,Excellent outing for Family,My wife and I took the grandchildren to see the aquarium and had a great time. The ability to be up close and even be able to touch the appropriate items was fun for grandchildren and grandparents.We will return. Found you can get discount tickets in some places and online.,CaliforniaDreaming07
20,Google for a coupon,While in line I googled and got an $11 off each adult ticket which made the price more reasonable. Inside was externally loud because it’s obviously filled with little kids. Would have been better if there was some kind of sound dampening materials used to help mellow down the loudness,Ron C
50,Great place for all ages to explore (definitely kid-friendly),"The aquarium had many exhibits with easily visible and unique marine life, all of which came from the Pacific coast, which was neat. I really appreciated that there were multiple areas to explore, which made it more like an ""adventure"" than the typical zoo/aquarium/museum (go in a circle, be part of 'the herd', leave). Definitely kid friendly (a few shark and ray pools where people can 'touch' the animals). Since it has so many elements geared towards young ones, be prepared for a lot of noise. The area for most of the animals seems spacious enough too, though there was a bit too much human-animal interaction for me (I just think it's not animal-friendly).",Patrick A
40,A great learning experience for kids and adults alike,"There is definitely an abundance of things to see at this aquarium. There are also live exhibits where you may touch sharks, rays, starfish and anemones. This is a great way for future generations to see and experience wildlife so that they may better comprehend the fragility of our oceans and the creatures that live there. Wish there were less stairs and that the complex was not on several levels as this makes it somewhat of a pain to maneuver around when you also have infants or toddlers in strollers. Otherwise, a very nice aquarium experience.",BlkRaven2u
50,A lovely way to spend the morning,This is a lovely aquarium. It was great to see the divers in the water tending to the fish. We saw some specimens we had never seen before. Very interesting place.,Amelia M
50,Very nice!,"It has great displays. The touching pools are set up great. They have them for sharks, stingrays and 🌟 starfish. We went through quickly due to getting there late. They do have shows with the sea lions through out the day. SEVERAL penny stamping machines. I found discounted tickets on Goldstar.",C. G.
50,Great way to spend a day!,This aquarium is really well done. Something for everyone! We went early on a summer weekday and had the place to ourselves for a little while. Feeding the Lorikeets is a must!,Mike3022
50,Beautiful Aquarium,"This aquarium is absolutely amazing. A great experience for kids and adults. They have great educational speakers and some hands on exhibits. Plan to spend at least 4 hours here. All the aquariums are large and amazing! Its very well run. It can be crowded, especially for the shows, so it's probably better in off times. When we went if was very busy, but we all had a great time. This is a must see if you are in the long beach area.",Marielena W
50,A wonderful day!,We are charter members and have enjoyed many a delightful day at the Aquarium of the Pacific. They have special celebrations during the year as well.,Sandra D
50,Night Dive is Amazing!,"We were in town, and found ""Night Dive"" listed under events local in the area and decided to check it out. So glad we did! It was a blast, great bands, DJ's, and drag show, all at night, while you could still see most of the animals and exhibits. Everywhere you turned, there was another bar if you needed a drink. These evening events are 18+, and worth the time. A little pricy, but a lot of fun.",RCon4001
50,such fun,Every time we head to Long Beach we plan for a day here. The kids love the seals and the outdoor shows!,Sarah O
30,Spoiled by Monterey Bay Aquarium,"Nice Aquarium and reasonable price of admission but after being able to visit the Monterey Bay Aquarium many times spoils you. This aquarium isn't as large and not as impressive. That said, still a great way to spend half a day in Long Beach.",Bayarearesi
50,"Long Beach, “Aquarium of the Pacific.”","The jewel of Long Beach Marina is the Aquarium. We have been here many times over the years. We came at the Grand Opening 20 yrs. ago. It continues to grow and amaze! Interactive exhibits, great hands on with touching pools.In the past can be very crowded. This trip was very calm and we had plenty of time to relax, watch the feeding and training of seals and Otters. They are expanding and some construction is going on. Can’t wait to see what’s next. A must see. Go online for coupons. We got adult admission for $20 because of 20 year anniversary.",Scott W
30,Weekday visit,"We stopped here on a Thursday. The aquarium was packed with kids groups. The exhibits were good overall, but the aquarium is on the smaller side and it’s challenging to navigate. We enjoyed the otters and seals, as well as getting to touch a bunch of sea life.",kitkat014
50,Wonderful Aquarium,"I visited with my 14-year-old daughter, who is studying toward a degree in marine sciences and very much wanted to visit. We were in Southern California on other business and it was the one place she couldn’t miss. We enjoyed the variety of exhibits and the knowledgeable staff. It is a very well kept facility with excellent displays and is educational without being dull. The various touch-tanks are fantastic for kids and adults. I especially enjoyed the rays and my daughter spent so much time helping and teaching families about them, how to get them to come to you, and how to gently touch them that a staff member quietly complimented her and asked if she had considered applying for a summer job, which made her very happy. We spent the entire day and loved every minute.",Jodeegu
40,Great aquarium,"This is a great aquarium to spend the day at with family. Kids love all of the different jelly fish, sea otters and outdoor shark lagoon with a shallow touch pool. After the aquarium, take a nice walk to the lighthouse right next door and enjoy the view!",esami19
40,"Worth a visit, small but memorable","This is a nice aquarium, near a lot of attractions in Long Beach. The admission is kind of pricey but if you google, you can find deals and many times Ralph's grocery store offers discount coupons. It is a smaller venue, but then you do not get overwhelmed. The outdoor petting area is very cool. You can touch little sharks and other marine life. Good for kids and adults.",travelingrules
50,Great day out,"This place is great for kids and adults alike.We took our 8 month baby and she loved it.Great flow to the place with plenty of educational and visual exhibits.We thought the pricing was super reasonable, there's also packages to look out for including boat rides etc which we'd of taken up if our girl was a little older.As said, a great aquarium with lots going on but all done really well.We loved it!",Tonkster
50,Fun place for a date!,"So many exhibits to see! It's a lot of fun to learn about all the animals and touch sea creatures! I wish the admission prices stopped creeping up and up, but it's still worth it. :)",Paul
50,Small and quaint,"This is the perfect size aquarium if you have smaller children or elderly adults. It has 2 stories and offers a little restaurant on site. It was very clean and the staff is very friendly. It is also in a great location right by the Long Beach Pike Downtown so you have plenty to do when you are done shopping, restaurants, movies and more. I wished it was a little bigger but it still had a lot to offer with exhibits. My grandson and elderly father had a great time.",Keri A
30,Cool place to visit but very busy,This was our 2nd visit here and it is fun but really busy as there are lots of school groups.It is a fun and fairly inexpensive way to spend a few hours.,Layne L
40,Good Times,This place is awesome! Take your family take your kids they will love it and take lots of pictures. See as much as you can it's a wonderful place to visit and you will learn a lot of things. I think they have some classes for kids like arts and crafts. And they have showing Tails so take the family go have fun.,Marion W
40,Go early or late to avoid the groups of little ones!!!,Lots of interesting exhibits inside and outside of the museum! I found their map very confusing so just decided to start at the top floor and work my way down. Lots of fun for all ages.,Sandi20170
50,Great place!,"Really enjoyed all the exhibits. It was overwhelming to start with, but once we figured it out it was great. We took a behind the scenes tour, which was really worth it. Loved seeing the scuba divers cleaning the various tanks. The talks and presentations we saw weren't really worth it. Too many people to be able to see or enjoy. I was there on a weekend so maybe a weekday would be beter.",ualaw2006
40,Very nice but smaller on the aquatic exhibits,"We are members of this aquarium and really enjoy it. It has fantastic indoor exhibits of many different ecosystems which is fascinating to watch, plus being indoor which is a huge bonus during the summer heat. The outdoor aquatic exhibits are a bit underwhelming as there are just a few. There are quite a few touch pools for the sting rays and some sharks. The penguin exhibit is a fave for my 3 year old as there is this cute tunnel that they crawl in and watch. They have a few exhibits that are on loan which adds variety and theres a small water play area for the kiddos to crawl around on. A lot of locals and tourists travel here so it can be a stroller parking lot but it works. They are expanding this facility but it doesn't appear any additional outdoor exhibits. It's fun for about 2-4 hours depending on how fast you walk on through. Parking is pretty easy across the street in the garage. We usually eat in the surrounding area before heading out.",Nicole R
50,Awesome Aquarium,"My favorite Aquarium. I have been to several top notch aquariums in the US and this one tops them all. The infrastructure flow, exhibits, and educational & cultural outreach, makes the Aquarium of the Pacific the best!",Erlinda C
40,Respectfull environment,Nice visit! 3 hours was plenty to see all!! The tunnels under the water are very nice. Many employees are giving interpretation lessons. A few restaurants nearby.,Normen D
50,Amazing aquarium devoted to conservation and the environment.,"Amazing aquarium devoted to conservation and the environment. I love this place. They have some great educational exhibits as well as making it very fun and giving kids lots of hands on learning opportunities. There are “labs” allowing kids and very excited adults to interact with many different animals. I know a lot of people get dissuaded by the price, but they should know that their ticket price goes directly to supporting these animals and conservation efforts. This is across the board for every azaa certified aquarium.",Davebanbeck
20,Too expensive for what they have,"I was disappointed with this place. It cost $100 for 2 adults and 2 small kids to go see fish. It seems like a legit place because it’s so big, but everything is just so spread out so it takes longer to walk around.",ocjax
50,Milton review,"Visited and Enjoyed everything about this destination, from the interaction with the animals to the film presentations. This hopefully will not be my first and only trip here.",mhavis1959
40,Small but mighty.,"OK, so it's not as big or glitzy as aquarium at Monterey Bay. So it can be overwhelmed with kids a lot of the time. So it's not very...big. Still, this is a very nicely done aquarium, with some beautiful displays, a wide variety of sealife to wonder at and interact with. Making the most of its relatively small space, the aquarium is split into indoor and outdoor areas, both with multiple levels. Here you will find innumerable fish species (including sharks and rays that you can touch), octopi, crustaceans, sea birds (including penguins), and seals and sea lions. The galleries are nicely done, and the entire place is very kid oriented and friendly. This results in it being crowded with immense amounts of children much of the time, but there's something about watching little ones experience the wonder of nature that kind of warms the heart, so it's all good. A great way to spend a couple of hours, and the gift shop is fab. They also validate parking at a reduced rate, so be sure to bring your parking ticket and get it stamped at the exit.",venckman2017
40,good aquarium,"good aquarium, good to take little kids, not too expensive and close to the downtown area with nice scenic walks",Timothy N
50,"Nemo, friends, and more","I was highly impressed with this aquarium, I’ve been to several aquariums all over and this one was one of my favorites. My favorite part about this aquarium was the wide selection of sea creatures you can pet, including my favorite, Moon Jellyfish best experience ever.",clos801
50,Whale of a time,"A nice aquarium. Growing up on the east coast, this gave a look into the pacific aqua life. There are some beautiful representations here at the facility. Staff appear to enjoy their work as well. A nice afternoon.",terrysp12
50,One of best,"The variety, clean , size, friendliness of workers all superb. Amazed of how many different species I could see and how well all is presented.great work let's save the ocean!",Caroline R
50,Fun place to visit for adults and kids,"One of the better aquariums compared to others around the world. The exhibits are very clean and very well maintained. You may wanna expect that, but its not always the case.What I found very noteworthy is the fact, that they let visitors touch animals. Even sharks can be touched and rays. A very good and educational way to loose fear but not respect from for example sharks. The touching part is always guided and under supervision of the Aquarium staff. They give interesting and seemed to me, competent information.",Equitecnoc
50,Truly a thrill for a toddler,"We went as early as we could get there, about 10am before crowds of people arrived. We received our booklet about the different exhibits and made a point of getting the embossing stamp offered at those exhibits. The 2 1/2 year old enjoyed trying to manipulate the embossing machine. The aquarium had so many colorful exhibits and touch tanks, all ages can be entertained. Sharks, sea lions, jellyfish, birds, fancy seahorses, all very fascinating and you can get a hand stamp and return later in the day which is great if the toddler (or adult) needs a nap!",sixxmom
50,A Splash of a Good Time,"We have been here before and looked forward to visiting again. We went the week after Easter, on Friday, it was crowded, many other families were there, I assume because they were on Spring Break too. You must park at the parking structure across the street from the aquarium, this structure is not specific to the aquarium, anyone can park there, they just need to get the parking validated at a local restaurant or in our case by aquarium staff. With that being said, plan to come early to get parking, if there is an event, say like the Grand Prix, you are out of luck, very crowded! They are adding another wing to the aquarium, so even though there is construction it's still open and there is plenty to see and do. We saw many lovely fish and creatures. The otters and seals were adorable. The gift shop is large with something for everyone. The cafe is expensive, I plan to bring our own snacks next time, but it was nice to sit at the cafe and rest our legs. If you are done early you can walk along the marina; there are many restaurants to dine at with stunning views of the Queen Mary. It makes for a fun, full and active day or weekend!",bzzymommac
30,Last minute visit!,My husband and I went there as a last minute thing with my son. When we arrived it was super crowded!! There were way too many people so you couldnt stay at most of the places trying to admire the animals. You could not take pictures with people snapping their phones and cameras out. I wish we would have gone on a day when it was not too busy. DO NOT GO AROUND FLEET WEEK!!! HORRIBLE!!!!,I7895UAvanessat
50,Top 2 of my favorite west coast aquariums to visit!,"My favorite part about this aquarium are all of the extremely knowledged volunteers. You can see that each one has a passion for what they do; I saw a woman with 1,000 hours of volunteering on her name badge. A young gentleman (maybe high school age) talked to me for 20 minutes about their leopard sharks and electromagnetism. Always a great experience!",Bianca T
50,Interactive Experience and Great Jelly Fish Display,"Great for parents with kids who want to let them touch and get interactive with ocean animals. My favorite thing besides being able to pet sting rays and sharks is being able to touch the jelly fish. They have a really large assortment of jelly fish displays that are beautiful. Lots to see and do here, plus the bonus of the lorikeet display.",rachelpLBC
40,Beware of children,It’s a great aquarium with some beautiful sea creatures in nice sized tanks but don’t go on a School day as hoards of children visit and they are loud!,Ponypanic
50,Impressive aquarium!,"One of the country's great aquariums. Extensive displays of various habitats, well-organized and accessible to a wide range of visitors, with several demonstrations.",JerryM
30,Otters were really stoked.,"Modest aquarium shined a spotlight on West Coast habitats.Liked the stadium style layout. Gave the building more space than it really had.Could use a little more innovation for a high-tech area. (like the otter webcam at the Tennessee Aquarium).Dang! No dolphin show… (like the one in Baltimore). Instead the otters were the most active in the place.On the other hand, enjoyed browsing all the oddities in the museum shop.",Lapster2011
40,We enjoy this place,"When we first arrived, there were several school groups and it was hard to see much. After lunch, however, most of the groups were gone and it was easy to see the animals. I love the jellyfish. We were there on a Thursday, so on the weekends, it may be a little busier and hard to see some exhibits. Most of the information is posted on cards at the base of the aquarium as opposed to posted on the wall or above it, so if there are lots of people standing in front of an exhibit you can't really read about the animals.",tkabj
30,Too many extra costs,The good... loved all the Jelly fish and to be able to touch them was fun! Layout was nice with 2 levels(stairs and elevators). Restrooms were clearly marked and 2 places to eat and get snacks.The bad... price 29.99 for adults seems expensive. I did find a local book with a 8.00 coupon which was nice(from the hotel). Now maybe I could take the 30 bucks but then if you want to see the movie 4 dollars more....the birds 3 dollars more. Too many add on at a already high price. We didn't even get to see the penquins (the exhibit was closed but NO mention of this when we bought tickets). The outdoor area was smaller size and poorly marked. It took is 2 adults about 2 hours to get through the entire thing. Definitely a place for younger kids with all the touch/feel exhibits. I was just underwhelmed.,JulieBandSteveB
50,A day at the aquarium,"This place is amazing! The kids enjoyed every minute of it. Very informative. The staff did excellent jobs of explaining each different area of the aquarium. Good food at the cafe on the second level, loved the polenta and chicken. It was a 3 hour car ride to get there but worth it.",fourguysonegirl
50,Great site to visit for the entire family! Make sure you stop here for a full day!,"We stopped here for a fun visit before we left on a cruise, and it was fabulous! This is a must -do! Don't miss this attraction!",santadan2014
50,A great aquarium!,This is a very nice aquarium and it even includes a Lorikeet and monarch butterfly area. Beautiful sea life exhibits!,Nancy A
50,Feed the Lorikeet's!,"I like all the hands on activities at the aquarium. Lots of sea life you can touch like rays, sharks, jelly fish, and then there are the Lorikeet's!If the feeding station is open, pay the $4 for the little cup of liquid food. As soon as you enter the aviary, the Lorikeet's will land on you immediately! Two landed on me and three on my wife. They will walk down to your hand and start drinking the food. I tried to move the food from one hand to the other and the bird bit me! Hilarious!It was definitely crowded as kids were off school for Easter break. I would try to go during the week when the local kids are in school.Lunch time gets packed in the cafe and the food is ok and can be a little expensive. This is standard for all places like this though.If you can see two attractions in Long Beach, I would combine the ticket packages to save money. I combined the Aquarium and Queen Mary and purchased from the Aquariums website.There is parking in a parking deck close by just make sure to validate your parking ticket after entering the Aquarium. $8 to park with validation.We had a good experience and would come back.",Tony G
40,Congested on Saturday but we'll done!,Large facility with nice displays. We could of used more signs to help find the entrance. The Saturday we visited was almost too crowded.,Kingsville_Mike
50,First visit with children,We went for the first time with our 8 and 12 year old kids. It was very crowded but we saw everything. The exhibits were all beautiful and there was a wide array of animals/sea life. My kids were delighted to be picked to help with the sea otter show. My daughter’s favorite animal is the otter. We all had a great afternoon.,KarinaH
50,Just love the Aquarium... Lots to see.... Lots to do,"We took the grand daughter to the Aquarium when we visited Los Angeles. We had a great time watching the beautiful fish swimming in the enormous tanks. Special treat to feed the Lorikeets from a small cup of nectar in your hand. I always enjoy the frolic of the Otters. There are several touch me exhibits that the children like. Watch your fingers and avoid the mouth of the sharks. There is extensive renovation in progress. Cant wait to see the new exhibits. Lunch in the Café was pretty typical, but fairly priced. Love the Aquarium. I go any time I am near one.",mrmachine
30,Hoping for more,"It was a very basic aquarium that was cool but expensive for a run of the mill aquarium. The Seal tank which could've been the highlight for us was ""being cleaned"" was horrible beyond the point of routine cleaning.",AntD141
40,A good aquarium,"Once the expansion opens I suspect that this could be one of the better aquariums in the world. As it is it has a great selection of exhibits, the first place we’ve been able to touch jellyfish. Well worth a visit if you are in Long Beach and if you have kids it is worth the drive from LA.",MarkAndCathy
50,Awesome!,We had the best time at the Aquarium. So much to see. So much to touch. Staff was so friendly and helpful. Easy parking($8). Good food choices nearby. Beautiful area. Loved it! A must see!,3peepsocon
50,A Day With Family,"A wonderful day spent with family. Every variety of sea life to see. The tunnel is fun to walk through. The 4-D short movie was fantastic. I have never seen such vivid 3D before with the added effects of mist, smoke, and lights. Worth the extra dollars spent. We had lunch there, and all of us commented on the cooking. They use fresh food daily. Healthy choices.",Dianna S
50,Great aquarium and fun,"The Long Beach Aquarium of the Pacific is a great way to spend an afternoon.With a combined focus on research/preservation and sightseeing for guests,with sharks and jellyfish and other amazing sea life, the Aquarium is interesting and enjoyable for all ages.",Alexander_Designs
50,Hands-On Marine Education,"The aquarium is full of literally awesome displays and experiences. The headline feature is a clear tank that must be 30 feet high, where you can see hundreds of fish and the divers who tend to them. Smaller displays feature jellyfish, seahorses, and more, with viewing windows set low enough that young children can see without being lifted. There's a touch tank that kids love, and a pinniped habitat with a transparent underwater tunnel. For children of all ages, this is a real treat.",Bob S

There are tons of hands-on exhibits for kids (and adults) and everything is so beautifully laid out.I recommend checking out some of the shows to break up the day a bit.",dogtorCB
40,Fun place to visit!,"Our daughters, ages 9 and 12, loved this aquarium. I especially loved being able to touch sharks, sting rays, and jelly fish. There was plenty of room at each exhibit. We also watched the sea lion show, which was great! I was very thankful that the gift shop prices were very reasonable. Both girls were able to get a decent sized stuffed animal for only $15!",lisa_Utah
40,Fun for All,We hadn’t been to the aquarium for many years. This time we had our grandson with us and he loved it. The aquarium has been kept up well and the harbor area outside seems to have undergone renovations. The addition of the bird area was surprisingly enjoyable. I would highly recommend a trip to the aquarium for anyone. It isn’t just for families with children or teenagers.,Linda R
50,Fun for everyone!,"We visited the Aquarium of the Pacific years ago before their renovation, but decided to come back and try the Behind-The-Scenes tour.What an incredible place! The Aquarium offers so much to learn about and so much to celebrate. The ocean is beautiful and the creatures within are absolutely amazing!",Beverly C

50,Sea Animals Galore,I always love going to the Aquarium of the Pacific and checking out all the sea animals. The jellyfish are just absolutely amazing. The Lorikeets were hungry and eating from our hands.

40,Adorable creatures,I was in town for the Flooring convention and one of my sales reps and I took the day exploring and went to the aquarium. The seals and the Penguins were absolutely adorable and it seemed like you were so close to them that you could almost touch them! I really thought the jellyfish were amazing I’ve never seen anything like that and I’ve been to several aquariums around the country. And I’m a frog nut it was fun trying to find them in their habitats! And the staff there were very helpful and went above and beyond! If you ever are in the area this is a must see they are building onto it so I can’t wait to go back!,Dfergi2105
40,Worth visiting.,"The Aquarium is building on to the current building. The current building looks a bit tired. But there are plenty of exhibits to see, and staff to help you touch rays, sea stars, and other water creatures. I personnally loved the big variety of jellyfish that they had.",manders2016
40,Enjoyable trip to the Aquarium,My fiancé and I loved the Aquarium of the Pacific. Great outing to plan when you are exploring the pier and shops. Our favorite was the hands on experience with the sting rays and baby sharks!,Chrissy G
50,Amazing,I absolutely loved this place!!! My son had originally hunted this place out as it is one of the few aquariums that still offer a program for qualified divers to dive in their exhibits.I wasn't really sure what to expect but honestly I was impressed. The place is currently undergoing some kind of construction on the outside but coping very well. It was very busy but still lots of space to move around. We had a little browse and then my son went off to do his dive.The amazing volunteer guide that looked after him kindly offered to show us around and give us a little more background and information and he was really interesting and you could just tell he really enjoyed his work. To be honest that level of enthusiasm seemed to gravitate from all the staff which was so nice to see.The place is so well organised a very well oiled machine. We were treat like royalty and looked after so well it really made our day.My son loved his dive experience there and even got to bring home the GoPro footage and a t shirt and towel to remember the day.I can't praise this place enough it gives me faith that our oceans are in good hands with people like this assisting in its preservation.,Michelle H
40,Go As Early As Possible To Beat the Crowds,"There is a lot of great stuff to see and do at the Aquarium but it does get very crowded so I would recommend going as early as possible. We were unaware of the small water park and were not prepared with a change of clothes for the kids but that did not stop them from playing in the water and having a blast! There is food and drinks available but we brought a picnic, it's a great setting and there are picnic benches right outside the Aquarium with a view of the marina. Lots to see and learn so plan on a full day!",LadyDiButterfli
40,Very Nice!,Love aquariums and this one was no disappointment! Touch tanks and avaries and so much to see!.. Great place for kids!,Barbara O
30,Cool place,Cool place but kind of small and for smaller children. I did the whale watching tour and that was cool. Saw some whales and dolphins. Water was choppy so I did get sea sick. Might have been better to do the 45 minute tour. But it was nice. I didn't see much in the aquarium but they had some cool fish to see.,Relonda S
50,Great displays.,"There are indoor as well as outdoor pools and displays. Loved the jellyfish. There are touching pools and a Lorakeet cage (buy the nectar because the birds will land on you making for a great photo op). One of the best gift shops I have seen anywhere. If you go on the weekend, go in the morning. The afternoon was very crowded.",Tami P
50,Spent the day here,Came here with my gf and had a wonderful time. It was a super crowded Sunday but we saw every exhibit. Make sure you feed The lorikeets!! So much fun. One sat on my head!!,mikeconnors1
50,Awesome and enjoyable Aquarium of the Pacific,"I usually take my grandson to this place to enjoy the aquatic environment. My grandson enjoyed watching different kind of fishes with different attractive colors. And after visiting this awesome place we stroll along the shoreline park to have some fresh air and eat to a restaurant of his choice. And if you go further, you can enjoy the beach too. What an awesome place to spend free time. Pride of Long Beach, California.",maria f
40,Very interesting and diverse aquatic species. Also the parrots were really fun to feed!,Went with my daughter and her boyfriend and had a really wonderful afternoon on a sunny warm day in March if you can believe it. The otters were fun to observe and the parrots were extremely playful in their own habitat. You can purchase a little cup of nectar outside the exhibit and they will land on you and feed out of the little cup of nectar. Fair warning though: you may get Pee’d or pooped on by the parrots.,Sas B
40,Took out of town guests to the Aquarium,The aquarium is very well maintained from my point of view. You can breeze through it in an hour or two or you can stay all day if you want to read all the information that is available and take in some of the presentations. It is relaxing and enjoyable.,jphl63
40,Nice experience,The Aquarium of the pacific has a focus on species that are indigenous to the Pacific Ocean and is a nice place to spend a few hours. It is not a huge aquarium but is probably about the right size for most of us.,KNLA13
30,Nice distraction,Spent a few hours at a cost of $26 each pleasant experience but not overly exciting soon experienced but have to say the exhibits were pretty good and lots of kids really enjoying themselves,leedsforever1
50,Awesome,Love wildlife especially the aquatic variety and yes they have just that and way more hope to visit again as soon as the add on it complete,Devin B
40,Worth the time and the dime,Got there before it opened to beat the crowds excellent chance to get close to exhibits before they get too crowded. Great to see kids get so excited seeing things for the first time! Great volunteers give you all kinds of information just ask questions touch tanks were awesome always remember two fingers only lol. I would have given this five stars but the bird display exhibit it cost $4 for the nectar which is okay but I wasn't expecting to get attacked by the birds to the point where for no apparent reason they start gnawing on my hand and biting me even though they had nectar right there. Enough to draw blood. If it wasn't for having little kids everywhere the bird might not have survived I wouldn't let little kids hold the nectar there's a gauge out front that gate that says how hungry they are today it said they were very hungry maybe it would be better to go when they weren't quite so hungry? Never thought a little bird could be so aggressive LOL they're very pretty,xjwhitewing
50,Nice aquarium in a great location,We enjoyed our day here. The kids had lots to do and understand. The animals all looked healthy and happy plus the volunteers were awesome.,shandakellysmith
50,Always a Treat!,"Our family loves this place. (Yes, I realize some people are staunchly opposed to aquariums under any circumstance, but if you're going to go to one, this is it.) Aquarium of the Pacific has really terrific conservation programs, including working with other programs and universities around the country, educational programs for both kids and adults, evening and holiday events, and of course wonderful exhibits. (They don't keep whales in small tanks, no shark shows or anything like that. They have a solid reputation for taking good care of their animals.) It's a great opportunity to develop a better understanding and empathy for creatures we would never otherwise see. And yes, it's just plain fun.",AmyfromPasadena
40,Great Family Site,All of my nephews and nieces went and we had a great time. I would say that for family propuse this place is great and worth the money.They are going through a remodel and this place will more welcoming than before.,Dezhern
50,Amazing Place... Caring Staff.,I never get tired of coming here. The aquariums are amazing and the staff is as good as can be!!! Extremely enjoyable on a week day during the day... as it tends to be less crowded.,Let's Make Life Good
40,Sunday visit,"If not for a coupon we had for a reduced fee out visit for a family of four would have been almost $100. Despite the price, a great educational experience for kids and adults alike. Great exhibits both indoor and outdoor exhibits. A good investment for the family.",calursus82
30,Quick visit,As out Day was packed with other events we did a quick visit to the aquarium. Very busy as it was a Saturday.We had day passed so did have to pay the $30.00 to get in!!A little disappointing with the large mammals but under the water displays were brilliant.A couple of hours and it was all done. Brilliant for young families not fab for adult parties.,Scrumpy999
40,Small but good,"They're expanding which is good, they need to. Lots of places offer a combo ticket here which is good. The aquarium itself can be done in an hour or so, so plan to do something with it.",Stu S
50,One of the best Aquaria,"Ttoally interactive. Lots of animals to touch, exhibits are big and give above and below water views. Ocean exhibits have wave currents!Visit the lorikeets for a special interactive treat!.",caanneu
50,Great day out.,Came here on a Saturday which was very busy. The staff was very nice. I went around twice and got my book stamped that I was given at the beginning. Unfortunately I couldn't catch the shows as I entered a bit late. I enjoyed touching the different things that were on display.,sauditraveller
50,Great place for family event.,I walked to the Aquarium and along the walk watching dolphins in bay. What a beautiful area to make the day of it.,Debra S
50,Fantastic,Bought harbor cruise combo ticket. The aquarium is smaller than I expected and we went through in a little over an hour. We were neither overwhelmed nor rushed so things were just about right. I ended up taking a lot of pictures because the exhibits were so well done. I really liked the jellyfish. There was a decent variety of species and the aquarium made good use of space. There are both indoor and outdoor areas. Staff and volunteers were great ... knowledgeable and friendly.Minor detail ... Can’t put my finger on it but the map pamphlet was not very helpful. Ended up sticking it in my backpack and navigated on my own. Maybe there could be better directional signs.Overall a wonderful time.,Hank H
50,Enjoyable afternoon,"The aquarium was very good, lots of different sealife to see. The cost was average price. would go back again",Jo C
50,Fabulous aquarium with a must see behind the scenes tour!,Such a good aquarium! The behind the scenes tour is a must! You learn all about how the aquarium runs and how and what they feed the animals. You get to see holding tanks where they keep animals/fish for things! We saw a pregnant male seahorse and very tiny baby seahorses and so many other things! We also fed the Lorikeets and that was awesome--they were adorable birds! We got to pet rays and sharks! And I saw a sea dragon for the first time--that was my favorite! Very well put together aquarium! I recommend it highly!,MelCS7
50,Great visit,Taking a break from a business function at the convention center we explored the aquarium. Amazing displays of all varieties of see life in different environments. The aquarium is under going a large expansion but the open areas are clean up to date and interesting. Well worth the trip especially if you’re from the East Coast!,Islander1971mv
40,Great Visit,"Had nothing better to do for an afternoon so went on a date to the aquarium. It was the most I've ever spent to look at fish, but well worth the visit. We were busy for hours looking at everything - I can only imagine what this would be like for a child. I'd definitely return!",Hannahbears_mom
50,Best Aquarium I've toured,"Huge number of fish and animals, both inside and outside. Well organized and laid out so that you can flow through the exhibits without backtracking and everything is easy to see. If you like Jelly Fish this is your place.",Sanitarian2
40,Great family spot or a good date location.,"If you have kids, they'll love all the interactive parts of the aquarium. Getting to touch sharks and sting rays in the lagoon is really cool. Good times for a couple as well. If your into this type of thing. But come on.... who isn't.. ha.",Salvador D
50,Fun for a few hours,We had half a day with nothing to do so we went here. It was priced a bit high at $30 but in the end I felt it was worth the money spent. Friendly volunteers are everywhere and dont hesitate to tell you about the fish and critters. The penguins and sea otters steal the show!,erickl1000
50,Fun While Learning,The Aquarium has a wide array of species and a fun and interactive learning environment. Staff is friendly and professional and finding parking in the structure adjacent to the Aquarium is very easy to do.,Rokc E
30,Hard to navigate and follow,"It was a decent aquarium.. It was hard to follow each exhibit since it wasn't as organized as other aquariums I've been to. The exit/entrances to each section was not clearly labeled and we walked in a circle a couple of times. Since it was somewhat disorganized, it made it hard to walk around when there are a lot of people visiting. IF you go, visit on a not so busy day. Parking was decent and the marina view was great.",Mia
50,Purchase a combo ticket,"Thoroughly enjoyed this lovely aquarium. I would set aside 3-5 hours maximum to enjoy all they have to offer. There are many, many educational opportunities available. I suggest purchasing a combo ticket with an afternoon whale watching tour. A team of aquarium employees join the whale watching cruise. Their knowledge enhances the tour greatly. Bring a sweater for the aquarium and a mid weight jacket for the whale watch. It gets chilly.",MITravelChick
50,"Fabulous, mind blowing sights","A friend & I went here for the day! It’s huge, clean, well planned out, & full of interesting information and sea creatures! We liked the sea horses, leaf dragons, many kinds of jelly fish, otters, sharks, seals, poisonous frogs; & the puffins were hilarious to watch take deep dives! They would pop out of the water, then shake their wings! It’s always fun to watch the penguins “fly” under the water! The price was very reasonable, too!The touch tanks were also a delight!",Kathleen B
50,A Perfect Family's Day Out,"It was a hot day and we wanted to cool down a little bit in the Aquarium of the Pacific, located in Long beach downtown.It is a must see for anyone passing through the area, particularly if accompanying young ones. It has something for everyone, toddlers to the very old. The varieties and wonders of life in the Ocean are bound to create waves in our heart.",Sufee Ahmed
20,ok no dolphins or whales,no great showsno whales or dolphinsthe exhibits were nice and many fish from all over the world shark petting for the kids,Nick B
40,Great place to spend a few hours,"We took our almost 3 year old daughter here one day while we were visiting LAX/Disneyland for a week. We spent about 2 hours here and checking out all the sea creatures. We love the interactive actives (moon jelly touch tank, sharks and sting ray touch tank, touch tank for anemones and sea stars, feeding Lorikeet, live feedings and puppet story time). We also saw puffins, which is kind of hard to find at the zoo/aquariums in Chicago.This place is stroller friendly, most paths are wide enough and there are elevators throughout. Plenty of parking at the parking garage across the main entrance but it wasn't free. You can get the parking ticket validated for $8 all day but if you only spent less than 2.5 hours at the aqurium, it's actually cheaper to pay the standard rate of $6. There is a small cafe located in the atrium and had some tables. Tickets are a little bit on the high side, but you can search online for coupons. There are plenty of things to see and do for a few hours.",LuckyUs77
40,"Nice aquarium, Interesting behind the scenes tour","This is a nice aquarium with a lot of exhibits with a good variety of marine life. The exhibits are spread out, with some inside and some outside. There were a lot of elementary school children there the day we visited, which made some areas both crowded and noisy. (We were spoiled by the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta where school groups are separated from other visitors.) There are several touch tanks for visitors who want to get up close and personal with the sea life.We took the Behind the Scenes tour and thoroughly enjoyed it. The tour lasted about an hour and covered a lot of territory. We learned about the food preparation, the divers who both feed the fish and clean the aquarium, how animals are quarantined when they are brought into the aquarium and how the exhibits are maintained. We were given seaweed to feed the fish at the tropical reef exhibit. The tour group was small enough (about 10 people) that we were able to get all of our questions answered and everybody was able to see and hear everything.",Richard4188
50,Best Kept Secret,"Went to Aquarium of the Pacific about a month ago and was absolutely shocked. After living in the bay area near Monterey this Aquarium is by far the best. Sea Animals are by far more exciting to look at, larger and filled with beautiful colors. All of the exhibits are nicely done and arranged with a balance of outside and inside galleries. The price is the best and we were able to use a local visitors guide to get additional discounts on the admission price. I'm going back as soon as I have a chance. I would recommend going around 1pm and doing all of the outside venues first, and then end up in the main gallery area where the lights come on at night and it seems more magical. I'm ashamed at myself for not going to this Aquarium earlier out of all the times we've traveled to the LA area.",Ricky460
50,Educational exhibits,"I took my 8 year old grand-daughter for a day of fun and fish she was so excited and the Aquarium did not disappoint! Although the venue is not very big they have many interactive things for kids and several talks and animal shows going on throughout the day as well as educational short films. Our favourite was the California sea lion show, get there early to get a seat, the trainers put on quite a show! There are also numerous tanks with fish, frogs and the most amazing variety of seahorses I’ve ever seen.",Ryder’sleash
50,Fun Visit,We were in LBC for a dance competition and we visited the aquarium during some down time. The girls (and mom's ) had a lot of fun!,cnhfromCoMo
50,Quick Visit prior to Whale Watch,"Great hands-on experiences for children. We ran through before going on the whale watch sponsored by the aquarium because the entrance tickets were included in the whale watch. Loved the jellies, octopus, rainbow trout, frogs and shark tank. Wish we had more time.",larmstrong2017
50,A nice mid-size aquarium - well worth a visit,"My wife and I visited the Aquaruim of the Pacific while in Long Beach, and were quite satrisfied with the experience. Located in Long Beach, it is near many restaurants and also shopping and other attractions.The focus of the aquarium is the Pacific, so there are perhaps fewer displays than are in some other aquariums, but all the displays were terrific. The facility was extremely clean and the staff and volunteers were knowledgeable and helpful. There are touch tanks and displays which offer an opportunity to experience something out of the ordinary.Thge only downside to our visit was that it was a field trip day and the Aquarium had 900 elementary students expected that day. The result was that the facility was a bit crowded and noisy, making it difficult to linger at some of the displays.Bonus tip. We purchased a whale watching combo ticket for $49.95 which gave us a 3 hour cruise into the Pacific where we saw a few Gray Whales. The whale watching tour by itself was $45 from the vendor, so we saved approximately $20 per person.We recommend visiting the Aqarium of the Pacific without reservation, although I might check to see how many school children were expected that day.",theRobertL76
40,A nice afternoon visit,We used the free bus from the Queen Mary to the Aquarium. Spent several hours enjoying the exhibits. The only downside to our visit was the huge amount of school children. It was apparently “field trip day” for local schools.,Peggy C
50,Really great aquarium!!!,"We traveled with our 14 and 17 year olds and they thought it was great too! You get to touch jelly fish, sting rays, sharks, sea urchins, etc. I think it is likely the best aquarium I have ever been to (been to Boston, Mystic, Camden that I can recall). The layout is a little tough to navigate even with the map, but we made it to all the exhibits. We got to see the sea otters being fed and performing tricks which was adorable! Only waste of time was the shark-feeding - they literally drag fish corpses in and out of the water trying to get them to eat - sometimes they do, but you don't really get to see in action. There are probably special shows and other activities that we didn't see/do, but we loved our experience.",Havashu167
30,Not really what we expected- kind of diappointing,"Our adult son wanted to visit an aquarium on our California visit and based on reviews we chose the Aquarium of the Pacific. After driving an hour and a half one way, we were surprised we only spent one hour and 15 minutes here. Granted we were three adults and did not spend a lot of time in the touch/petting areas but we did take time to view all the exhibits, see the scuba diver and talk to volunteers. Other than the identifying plaque, there is very little additional information given about the animals. The cost seemed a little high for the size of the aquarium and variety of animals present. $30 adults $17 kids 3 to 12 and $27 for seniors 62 and older. We did get a AAA discount and I understand if you go directly to a California AAA office ahead of time, the discount is greater. Aquarium is open 9 to 6. We went a little after 1 PM due to everyone stating that school groups were there ahead of this time. We still had several groups in the aquarium with us but they were leaving rather than arriving. Complimentary wheelchairs are available but you must present a credit card. Complimentary strollers or not but they do have what they call baby back packs you can use (credit card deposit). Since one of the focuses of the trip was to see jellyfish we were not disappointed here. There were more varieties them we’ve seen in many other aquariums very interesting to watch. They also do a great job with the horses. While few in numbers the sea lions and seals were fun to watch. The sea otters were very playful with the kids. There were also no large sharks but they did have a few impressive stingrays. Penguins were hard to see except when they were in the water. The staff is knowledgeable and the place was clean however $90 for an hour to 15 minutes of entertainment, didn’t seem worth it to us. I’m sure families with young kids would love the place.",IowaTravelFan
50,Very nice aquarium,A very nice aquarium with indoor and outdoor exhibits. Knowledgable and friendly staff. Pleasant touch tank opportunities for kids and adults.I was a little disappointed with the penguin exhibit compared with others I’ve seen but the overall layout was very good and visitor friendly.My visit was on a slow day and movement was very manageable. Not sure what it might be like on a very busy summer day with lots of strollers and little kids. Glad I didn’t have to experience that.I liked the Aquarium and recommend it.,crabramson
50,Enjoyed our visit here,Family has been to numerous aquariums across North America. This one is excellent and we enjoyed the closeness you feel with the animals and fish. Very closeup experience with most of the creatures. We were able to take in two shows with the mammologists and found them very informative. Lots of opportunities to touch and feel species. Another bonus was the short walk from the Catalina Ferry along the boardwalk. After our visit there were lots of close by food options. We planned for 2 hours here and our visit extended past 3. Highly recommend a visit to this tremendous facility,Ken B
30,Sea Creatures Up Close!,We anticipated that it would take 4 hours to tour the Aquarium. In reality we were finished in about 2 hours. Considering the price we paid I feel we were over charged. Most of the exhibits were interesting and well presented.,jrobertson46
50,AWESOME!,"We,(my daughter, son-in-law, 3 yr & 9 month old granddaughters) visited last week. The aquarium is absolutely gorgeous. Both granddaughters were fascinated by the fish which you could get nose to nose with and just glass in between. They had moon jellyfish to touch and little rays and sharks. They were staff everywhere to make sure that the touching was done gently and correctly, but this allowed the two girls to experience something that they would never otherwise been able to.There were exhibits with sea otters swimming with other fish, tanks with big fish, little fish, exhibits of sea horses, sea anemones, corals, examples of different coastal waters, and lorikeets....Both girls were fascinated the whole time we were there, we didn't get to see everything because they needed their naps. (We had lunch at Roscoe's, but that's another review!) (And be prepared for the school kids excursions, but it's all very well organized.)",houdiniturtle
50,Fun Fish,It was great to see the different fish. There was a person swimming with the fish that was fun to watch.,Ann A
50,Fun place for families!,"I love visiting the Aquarium. The exhibits are interactive and nicely layer out. It’s a fun place for families and kids. During the summer they have Night Dive for 18+ they serve alcohol and have a dozen food trucks outside. They also have DJ’s, dancing and activities.",Jennifer M
50,Great visit,"This is a great aquarium with lots of different exhibits. There are tons of fun restaurants nearby in Shoreline Village. And there's great shopping in the outlet mall across the street. Enjoy the views, ocean education, and shopping here!",LLZups
40,An inviting family experience!,"If you want to be astounded and wowed (and you have deep pockets for the hefty price), take your family to this gem of an attraction. Instead of you going to the ocean, the ocean comes to you! Aquarium of the Pacific rivals a similar attraction in the Bahamas, although the former is a smaller version of the latter. Aside from size, all such attractions are not equal. Each has its own flavor. Although not an attraction, the Red Sea (yes, of Biblical fame) has sea creatures found nowhere else in the world. The multifaceted beauty of our oceans, seas, and other bodies of water and waterworks (such as breath-taking waterfalls) are simply indescribable. Going full circle, if you want to taste the California flavor of our watery planet, Aquarium of the Pacific is a good place to start!",Firpo C
50,Birthday visit with Behind the Scenes Tour,"I have a high appreciation for my hobby keeping a large reef tank so going behind the scenes was very special to learn how they maintain the systems.This is a special place with really well maintained and beautiful exhibits of fish, mammals and even some birds.You get to see mostly those fish that are from the pacific area but you will not be disappointed! Highly recommend!",brmezz
40,Enjoyable experience,"Wonderful exhibits, plenty of available staff for questions and frequent schedule for feedings. Especially nice “hands on” exhibits for children. Butterfly area closed unavailable, but otherwise plenty to see and learn. Lovely gift shop. Discount entrance coupons are readily available through hotels.",Diane K
40,Pet the manta rays!,"This was a great aquarium, but it is pricey and not as big as I thought it would be. If you have a AAA card, you can get a bigger discount if you purchase your tickets through AAA prior to going. We saw everything in about an hour and a half. However, they have probably 6 different areas to be able to pet some type of jelly fish, manta rays, starfish, sharks and they have a penguin exhibit and seals. Things to do for the kids and some small shows.",Carey W
50,Fun and educational,Thoroughly enjoyed the aquarium. Lot of unique displays and very informative. Highly recommend doing the Behind the Scene Tour.,catlady256256
50,Highly recommend,"Centrally located on the Long Beach waterfront this is an excellent aquarium with wonderful exhibits. We spent 2 1/2 hours touring the main exhibit's (shark lagoon, lorikeets, sea otters, sea lions and seals, as well as the big tank displays. Then we took a Behind the Scenes tour which was superbly guided by Lannice. You go through the food preparations areas, the diver equipment area and then tour above the big 350,000 gallon tropical display. The quarantine areas, where animals are housed for observation and treatment are fascinating, and the tour through the water treatment and filtration areas is overwhelming. Highly recommend spending the extra money ($12 per adult) to do this.",Angus W
50,An aquarium with birds,I wanted to see the Queen Mary and ended up getting a combo ticket for the aquarium. Lucky I did. The Queen Mary was pretty disappointing with few places to see before paying more. The aquarium was really well done and even had bird feeding. Parking was close by. I’ll be back.,Egerlaender
50,Outstanding facility,We took our 10 year old and was very surprised and how many hands on things you could do. He especially liked petting the jelly fish and sting rays.,PTAMOM2017
30,Very expensive for what you get,"We had a coupon but couldn’t use it at the kiosk so instead of standing in extremely long line we just paid full price. For an aquarium on the ocean we expected much more. It was crowed, not from a lot of people but from the lack of space. It’s a small aquarium. We spent about an hour there and left disappointed. The highlights were petting the sharks and the jelly fish, every other exhibit was average.",CNG2005
50,Great day trip out for all ages,"Learn all about the sea life of the Pacific Ocean at this large aquarium. Huge tanks of fish and other creatures that live in the Pacific region. This aquarium has lots for kids to look at and touch at close range, such as rays, small sharks and anenome. They will also love watching the sea lions and sea otters play. The interpretations and explanations are written for all ages. There are also touch screen displays our tech savvy kids will love. During peak periods, the aquarium gets very busy, so come early. Parking is easy across the street in a dedicated parking garage. Be sure to remember to get your parking ticket validated for a lower parking rate. Also walk around the beautiful Long Beach waterfront. A view of the Queen Mary can be seen as well as several shops and restaurants. To truly enjoy the location, budget a day or at least entire afternoon. Look for late closing hours during peak holiday weeks.",Ian B
40,Sea Life Up Close & Personal,A great place to take a small kid or teenager. I do recommend a guided tour that will take you around this big aquarium. I feel like you appreciate marine life much more with a guided tour.,Henry P
50,Get there EARLY ...it gets crowded around 12,"it's a really fun place. They have fun interactive presentations going on around the clock. The young kids shows with animal puppets are hilarious my 3 year old had a blast.Two things I would recommend1-Download the aquarium app it helps with show times and locations2- Arrive early if you want to enjoy it, it gets really crowded you can barely look at anything or enjoy it.",zezee73
50,Aquarium of the Pacific Long Beach,Enjoyed taking my granddaughter to the aquarium of the Pacific. Disappointed in the frog exhibit they were so tiny you could hardly see them on TV they looked bigger.Parking is rather expensive and it’s unclear that you can get an eight dollar voucher when you walk in so parking actually cost eight dollars for the day not $16.,Linda M
40,Good but nothing that's stands out!,Decided to do a quick morning trip before leaving LA. Long Beach and the area around the aquarium itself feels clean and nice. The aquarium I found to be good. Comparable to the Two Oceans Aquarium in Cape Town South Africa where I live with the following exceptions... Two Oceans has a large shark exhibit that is well presented. Aquarium of Pacific has many touch displays which Town Oceans doesn't. I think it is difficult to really stand out an an Aquarium as many now have sharks on display which I imagine is a big draw card. Aquarium of the Pacific has many jellies on display which was both interesting and visually pleasing. Small shark and ray touch tank was nice but not too sure how great that is from and animal welfare point of view. I caught a bit of a talk at the main display tank when you walk in and based on that together with the general theme throughout I felt that the aquarium was ethically responsible and did have a conservationist priority.,Blake W
40,Very clean and enjoyable,Great place to take the family. Very clean and friendly. A lot of exhibits to enjoy and learn about marine life.,Manny V
40,Better than shopping,"Went with my husband to have a,relaxing afternoon. We had such a good time. The frog exhibit was interesting. I loved feeding the lorakeets. They were very hungry and I had 8 sitting on me. Luck was with me and I got out without beeing pooped on. The penguins were entertaining as were the sea otters, sea lions and seals.",RPVTravelmore
50,A Wonderful Way to Spend Part of Your Day,"This is a wonderful way to spend the da,y for families, couples and everyone else who likes marine biology! One of the neat things about the aquarium are the interactive stations throughout the facility where individuals can engage in learning. An example is sticking your hand in a simulated example of blubber to see how bubbler insulates and keeps whales warm. It is a wonderful learning environment!",Glena242015
50,Incredible education for children and adults.,"Greater appreciation for God's creation. The exhibits, shows and events are well worth the fee and small extras paid.",Carlos M
50,Aquarium of the Pacific,"Really cool place. great for kids and us ole one's. Great educational oppertunies. Really Cool Fish, Otters Crabs and a ton of other stuff",Slane22
50,Should be part of sites to see in Long Beach,"Explored this aquarium by myself while waiting for my friend. They have a wide variety of marine species to admire and look at. I observed the kids visiting were having the most fun, some of them seeing the animals live for the first time. Not too big a place, size was just about right to be able to see everything it has to offer. I would suggest this as a place to go to especially if traveling with kids.",Honorato S
40,Kid space is fun for the young ones,"We took our out of town grandson (4) to this and he enjoyed it very much. We did the lorikeet bird house that was fun, although he was nervous about landing birds. I took off a star for the cost of the entry fee and for the cost of a teeny cup of bird nectar. There is a movie and a decent cafeteria.",Judith D
50,Beautiful,"I brought my 14-month daughter to see this beautiful display. She was in awe of all the different fish, frogs, sharks, etc. so many children here. But the place is beautifully maintained. A must for children.",Cahanson
50,great place,love this place there always updating this place so its up to date with fun things to do and see. all the area is perfect hotels restaurants bars etc...,devildog2016
50,Tourism,It was a great attraction.The whole family - 8 of us - enjoyed the facility and sights to be seen.It is family friendly & even the small kids enjoyed it as did us older folks.,Greg S
50,Checking out what’s new,My family visits Aquarium of the Pacific at least once a year or so. It’s a nice place to hangout and relax. It has a good amount of fish and aquatic animals to watch and enjoy. Great to bring visitors from out of state or from Northern California. Perfect for kids/toddlers. They love it and the price is very affordable compared to many other options especially if you get their local discounts like AAA and a few others. Summer gets a bit busy than usual but still manageable. Usually very low wait times even at its busiest.,GusTonsay
30,Interesting Exhibits,"The sea life exhibits are diverse and interesting.I liked the sea horses exhibit in particular. The restaurant was little pricey,but overall it’s a good experience,especially for young children.",travelmogul333
50,Nice Visit,"There are quite a few sea creatures to see at this place, more than I expected. There were quite a few seahorses and jellyfishes. Visitors have the opportunity to touch the sting rays swimming in a shallow pool. The souvenir shop was nice too.",Porcelina8
30,Good for a Short Visit,"A little pricey ($30) for the size of the aquarium and what it has to offer. Good exhibits, very crowded on the weekend. The shark tank was nice. Nice place for families with young children and school field trips.",CRISTOS_AGAPE
50,Super cool for our 10-month-old,"Visited with our 10-month-old son. He doesn't care much for the zoo at home, but this was neat because he could get up pretty close and see what was going on in the tanks. He enjoyed watching the jellyfish (there are tons and tons of different species of jellyfish! I had no idea how many!) and the sea lions. The touch tanks would be awesome for an older child. We opted to check the stroller at the door, and it was good because 1) it allowed him to get closer to the displays, and 2) the crowd was huge on a Sunday and would have made maneuvering the stroller a bit difficult. The gift shop is beautiful and full of interesting and unique things, but expensive (as expected).",arrowrootcookie
40,"Jelly fish, sharks and otters",Super-duper fun. The exhibits are very well-thought out. They are very large with a lot of fish and other animals to see. We enjoyed the touch pools and the petting a jelly-fish. The otters are cute and you can pet a shark. There is even a zebra shark! (a cool shark). It is close to lots of restaurants and shops so you can do something else after visiting. You can get your hand stamped to come and go for the day.,alisacoopstl
50,Very enjoyable visit,Our visit to the Aquarium was part of our return journey following a cruise and I found it the perfect end of 17 days away from home. The staff are welcoming and friendly with a wealth of subject knowledge and judging by the number of families enjoying the day we were not the only ones to think so.A very fitting end to our holiday,williamsc152016
40,Great fun,While in long beach we took in the aquarium was a fun and interesting time. There was lots to see and do. With tanks set up so you could feel the exhibits.They had seal and sea-lion shows and divers feeding the fish.We have been to a few aquarium but thought this one was a must see.You can go on their web site and get a coupon for reduced admission.So in closing we really enjoyed ourselves and it would be a great place to take the family.,merrit girl
50,We had a blast,"When your 6 year old breaks down in tears after going to the aquarium because they are exhausted, I would say you had a good time! My family of five (mom, dad, 6,14, and 12) loved it. The exhibits were great. We especially loved the jellyfish, the seal lions, the otters, and the frogs. It seemed like the front of the building was going through a remodel, but it wasn’t an issue. We will definitely be back!",USCfan30
30,Very confusing layout,I had been here way back when it first opened and remembered it fondly. Our return trip was not so wonderful. We absolutely enjoyed seeing all the specimens but the floor plan is so confusing we were never sure if we saw everything we wanted to see or not. The main areas were also so cluttered with stuff it made it difficult to navigate especially as it got more crowded.,Scott P
30,Quick visit to the Aquarium of the Pacific,"It is a small aquarium so when 10 buses of school kids show up it gets very crowded very quickly. So, our party of 4 decided to take the Behind the Scene tour. That was very worthwhile, seeing all of the operation that goes on to keep the aquarium going. Our guide was very knowledgeable. When we met some of the divers back stage, they also took their time to answer our questions.",allisond660
50,Classy aquarium but not as good as Monterey's,Place does not show it's 18 yr old age and in fact will be adding on with an new auditorium. I found the free brochure to be a little confusing until after I roamed around a bit. If there was a suggested path way I did not notice it.Displays are quite nice and good variety of ocean life.Parking is across the street and only $8 for the day with validation before leaving the aquarium. If the hungries hit go to the cafe on the 2nd floor. Food was good and priced fairly. Avoid the 1st floor snack bar unless money is no object.,Bill H
50,Beautiful,"Huge variety of sea life, easy to see, very well taken care of. Plan to spend about three hours, try to catch the shows, especially the seal/sea lion expo. Fun for kids, interesting for adults, amazing beauty for everyone.",debrah731
30,animals very well taken care of,"not very big....disappointing that there were no large sharks. That said everything is well maintained, employees are very nice and knowledgeable and the animals are well cared for",bettinabudget
30,Very nice,"This was a great aquarium. So many species of fish and the sea horses and sea dragons exhibit was going on as well. It was immaculate, you can tell it’s very well taken care of. But there wasn’t really anything out of the ordinary here.",Deonna2
30,Nothing spectacular,I love my aquariums and this was the first American aquarium.It was ok but nothing spectacular. Not sure where the lorikeet enclosure fits in with an aquarium though???Gift shop has nice stuff.,aok47
50,Jellyfish Galore,"This aquarium is very well organized, the staff is very helpful and knowledgeable, and the variety of sea life is excellent. I you like jellyfish and seahorses this is the place for you, what strange and wonderful varieties they had on display.",SandyKatsFL
40,Certainly worth a visit,"Excellent for children. The aquariums are set out in a very nice, interactive, way. A pleasant stroll through the place with both underwater and surface viewing.",Brucesrobinson
20,Not worth the money,Sorry. Not worth the money. Does serve alcohol which we found funny but $9 for 2 bottles of water is stupid,Jennie1970
50,Amazing Aquarium!!!,"Always had a fascination with the sea and marine life and have been to some impressive venues but this has to be the best so far!!!Something to enthral all ages, particularly liked the jelly fish exhibit!The staff were very helpful and found the cheapest way possible for us to visit, so much so we went back a week later a second time!We'll be back again!!!",DavidBuckleyGM
40,plenty to do but pricey.,"Took my son, his wife and my two grandsons. Seemed a bit high priced for the amount of time we spent seeing the exhibits. All done in 3 hours.",charlesstangosr
40,Good and getting better,Took my 20-month-old grandson to the aquarium and he had a blast! The attraction is small in size but perfect for a young child and a tired grandpa. They are currently redoing the theater and this will be a great addition. Hope they allow entry to the theater as part of the entrance cost or allow patrons the ability to go to the shows at the theater separately without having to pay the entry fee for the aquarium. But overall a great place for an active little one.,simsusa
50,Amazing Adventure,I have been to the Aquarium before and everything I have gone there is something new. It is a great experience for children. The Aquarium is located where many restaurants are right outside when you leave. It's best you get there early because the parking structure fills up fast. It's is a great outing for a family anytime.,silsale
50,Wonderful jellies!,"I could spend hours watching all the different jellyfish. Amazing variety, the otters are a close second.",davidgL4998OE
50,Great local aquarium for the fam,"If you haven’t been here, go give it a try. It’s not the biggest or fanciest of aquariums, however they have a little bit of everything and some very cool attractions. I think you can bring in food which i recommend.",Kevin B
40,Beautiful Aquarium,"Love the location of the Aquarium you have a beautiful view of the Light House, theQueen Mary & Restaurants walking distance. It's a small Aquarium you can be donewithin 3 hours. Which is perfect for us.",yvettescorvette
40,Great attraction for adults and children,"Enjoyed this for years, first going with my wife and children; now with the grandchildren. It is great to see the wonder in my grandchildren's eyes as they enjoy the many aquariums and learning opportunities",John R
30,Not the best example.,"Having visited many other, similar aquariums, we found this one a little tired. Many of the tanks just didn't have enough information about the inhabitants. We were disappointed by this. I think we managed to see everything within an hour..... which is unusual for an aquarium of this nature.",KateandSteve
50,COULD SPEND HOURS,Visited the Aquarium of the Pacific for photographer's night. Very interesting facility. The photography was so impressive that we spent two hours in one room.I will return during daylight hours to experience the displays outside.,Chuck8700
40,Family fun,First check the internet for coupons! Second plan on an all day event with outdoor dining and surrounding location walks. Smaller venue but with lots of info for the whole family. Great location by the water. recommended meutermedia,MeuterMedia
40,Small but with a good touch pool,"We visited the aquarium with our young boy who loves aquariums. The entrance is a bit pricey for its size. The aquarium is not a big one. Our boy enjoyed the outdoor touch pool the most, where you could touch the bat rays. Surprisingly, the gift shop was quite big with many varieties of stuffed animals.",Journey_Delight
40,Nice for a Short Visit,"We visited the aquarium on a Saturday afternoon. The aquarium makes a good effort towards educating their visitors. The building seemed dated, but the displays were beautiful.",Karen S
50,Educational aquarium,We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the aquarium. It was not busy on the day we went and the exhibits are very good. The jelly fish are the stars of the show. Great colors. We liked the fact that the touch pools had staff or volunteers explaining what was being seen.Our age range was from 6 to 64 and we all had fun.The Long Beach waterfront is also very pretty and worth a stroll.Admission is pretty expensive but the aquarium must cost a fortune to operate so it seemed OK to us.,David C
50,Great family spot !,We had a great time here. Right smack dab in LBC and on the water. Our older teens liked it too. It's busy on the weekend though.,Scott and Jessica
50,After hour party,"Attended an after hour party on business and thoroughly enjoyed myself! The only comment would be that some of the exhibits were closed or poorly lit in the dark, likely for the animal's sake but also because it was after hours. All in all great location and design!",Jaycera
40,Fun visit,"Located right on the harbor, the aquarium is a nice stop for about 2 hours. Our visit included both interactive exhibits (with the divers) as well as multiple tanks with salt water fish, seals and sea lions, jelly fish, sharks, penguins, rays, and shorebirds. Unfortunately, we visited on a day when many schools had tours so the kids were loud and very active. But, the visit was fun.",Mason883
50,A fun and enjoyable experience for the whole family!,"We went to the aquarium in October and spent about 3-4 hours there. It was very interactive because it allowed us to touch sharks, stingrays, jellyfish and starfish. They have an indoor and outdoor area which also has a little area for kids to play. We watched a short video on radiation from Fukushima in our oceans. It was a nice spot for us to park the stroller while my son napped. They had people giving information at all of the interactive exhibits and they had several presentations while we were there. We watched one with scuba divers cleaning the main large tank that is in the lobby and we viewed the presentation on otters. My son that is only 2 had so much fun. He loved viewing all the different animals. It was one of the highlights of our trip. There is tons to see and learn. They sold some food and drinks but we didn’t try any. There was also a bird exhibit outside but they closed it due to the fires. I definitely recommend this place if you love aquariums. This was the first aquarium my son ever visited and he definitely loved it. My mom, aunt and husband also enjoyed the visit.",TMHinojos
50,Love it,Come here all the time it's a very fun place to go for people of all ages and it's for a good cause.,blahblah951
50,Nice experience,"It was fun experience. The jelly fishes were the best exhibits followed by the ""tide pool"" life, not certain what to call it.",Patt K
50,Great time to be had here.,We had a great time here. Lots of touch pools. Staff was great and we took the time to wait for the scuba divers to feed the fish. This was well worth it. When you pay for the parrot food make sure you buy two lots of it. You will love the experience and only one container of food will not last long.,JudyandBillG
40,Nice....,"I found this to be a great aquarium with a lot to see and experience in a short period of time. I would recommend that you check for specials they may be running at the time....I say this because I was there this past Saturday and I would expect it to be busy on a weekend. It happened to be costume day and any child wearing a costume was allowed free entrance. The place was jam packed and so the overall experience for me was less than desirable, however I did imagine myself there on a day when such an event was not taking place and thought it would be an excellent time. I can see why the kids are so drawn to it, the activities and events they hold are top notch! If only I were 10......",Jaimi O
50,A great visit,"I have been here many times, in the daytime and and night for fundraisers. It is wonderful at any time of the day. The outside pools are awesome!",Bill Curran
50,One of the best aquariums,This is such an amazing aquarium and set up so well. I have visited many aquariums and the set up being part outside and the two stories of tanks is just perfect without being too overwhelming for kids. The variety of animals/fish on display is quite substantial and I think greater than most aquariums. And I love the ability to be able to touch the moon jellies.,Jennifer B
50,Great aquarium,Great aquarium. Many types of animals. Lots of touch pools and shows. Very active sea otters; I could have watched them all day. Many types of jelly fish and seahorses.,AnnElizabeth97123
40,Nice aquarium,Has beautiful displays with large variety of fish and pet tanks. They are currently remodeling the outside. Easy to find coupons/discounted tickets online. They have many events throughout the year so it is a good idea to check their calendar online before going. They also offer a 3D cartoon movie or King Penguin movie for an a small additional fee. Not as crowded after 2:00 or 3:00 on a week day.,Rebecca H
40,Fishy Fishy Fishy,"If you want to avoid a weekend crowd take heed ongoing in the morning or after 3 pm. don't go when they are having a special event. You will be bomb barded with every kid in the family and an overabundance of baby strollers. When I say it was crowded I mean not even room to walk thru people looking at exhibits. The displays are nice and well organized by fish and oceans. I was disappointed by the new frog exhibit. I had seen one at another aquarium that was excellent. This was not at the caliber that the hype was advertised. The displays only had one or two frogs and most were babies, and when you are seeing a poison dart frog exhibit the frogs are small, to begin with. So add some frogs they can be seen. The food was good at the cafe but very pricey for fast food. They keep the cafe very clean with all of the coming and going of people. This aquarium was very cool but do yourself a favor and go during slower times, you will have a much better time and less frustration.",Tasazi H
50,One of the highlights of our trip!,My wife and two young kids (age 6 and 3) visited the Aquarium as part of our week-long vacation in the LA area. Easy to see why this is #1 in Long Beach. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit. The Aquarium has excellent exhibits and sits on a very nice location next to the water. After our visit we took time to stroll around outside and enjoy the views of the marina and the ocean. Highly recommend this venue as a place to visit. We'd love to come back and do it again.,GoGreenGoWhite1
40,Fun visit!,Came to visit with a group of friends before returning back to school. Us college kids had a great time so I feel like this is a place any aged person can enjoy. They have sections where you can learn & touch the animals. Overall it was a fun trip. After you can walk to the nearby restaurants or shop at the outlets too so that's cool.,Sienna B
50,Great Visit. Excellent Exhibits,"I visited here as Part of the Los Angeles Pass. I was with my Other Half and we came in after a Whale watching tour nearby. Very Glad we did. There are lots of great exhibits to see.We saw, sharks, jellyfish, otters, Penguins and literally a hundred other fish whose names I can't remember. There was a great Frog exhibit too and place where you could go and feed Lorikeet Birds. Several touch tanks as well. Various Rays and a few different eating stops too. I really enjoyed my visit here. There was plenty of people here when we went in but it never felt too busy or too crowded. .",Steve_In_Ulster
40,Great spot for a few hours,"Maybe a little pricey for the size of the aquarium, BUT our family had a great time. Something for everyone! They have a great collection of things you don't see just everywhere. We were most impressed with the collection of jellyfish. It was quite crowded on the Saturday we were there, but we still enjoyed ourselves.",Slayne2112
40,Small but Good,"We enjoyed taking our two year old grandsons here. It was a Saturday and quite busy, but exhibits are spread out and it was still enjoyable. There are interactive displays and outside areas as well that help.",JeriLG
40,Pre-Honeymoon,Very family friendly. A little spendy but was very cool. Had a lot of different marine life. Staff was kind.,Mandy A
40,Smaller than expected,Smaller than expected but still an enjoyable hour or so. Would recommend for families.Nice location for a little walk afterwards.,AmandaJayne9
40,Visit,This was my second visit to the aquarium of the pacific. I really enjoyed the aquarium with the colorful fish. Also liked the sea otter tank and seal/sea lion tank. For friend and myself it best to go on their senior citizen promotion day. We're planning on coming next year.,fredrick0808
50,Special Day Everyday,"I'm a local to Long Beach, and we are pass holders. I never get tired of going to the Aquarium of the Pacific. It's always clean, staff are so nice, extremely kid friendly. They do a great deal of rescue-rehabilitate-release for sea-life. I feel it's important to financially support these types of organizations. <3",newportsurginurse
40,Very nice / clean / interesting,"Lots of jellyfish. Very interesting and interactive - great for kids. They are expanding, which is needed. Parking lot across the street - $8.00 with validation",Tom_B_NJ
40,"Not a big aquarium goer, but I do like this one","I have been to this aquarium 10 times in 20+ years. Always clean, great exhibits, large pools, and the kids section outside is well run and organized.",Mark V
50,Beauty and nature galore,"The Aquarium is so clean, as are all the fish tanks. One can truly see what's behind the glass and make this a fun and educational experience.Also the outdoors areas with touching the starfish, little sharks, all under supervision is amazing! Love everything about it as so much beauty, love, nature and learning has been put into one amazing place.Take your time when there. Don't rush it. You want to see it all, unless you want to divide your experience into two days, one outside when the weather is gorgeous which is most of the time, and one indoors, when it's overcast or raining, not so often.This is an outing I can recommend for anyone, including children, elderly, handicapped people as it's wheelchair accessible.Have a fun day there, just as I did!",dythomson
50,Happy place to be,"Always loved marine life. From fishes to otters to jellies, always fun to watch. The place wasn’t that big but big enough to have interesting and not so big marine animals in one roof.",Franzludwigvan
40,Family fun,"Also, good place to bring your nice camera. Lot's of challenging environments and beautiful fish to capture pictures of.",reekster
50,Super cool!!!,"This place was great! One of the better aquariums I have been to, and really fun to see what’s along the pacific coast and ocean! This is my first time to California, let alone Long Beach, and it definitely lived up to the hype.",xtina2805
50,Packed with Information and Experiences,Great way to spend the day indoors! Lots of interactive exhibits and interesting live shows. Staff were enthusiastic and generous with handing out information and interesting facts.Displays are laid out very well. Bonus points for the accompanying passport that children can stamp at each exhibit. I love that they emphasize sustainability and conservation wherever they can.Bring your own food if you are not into the typical American diet. They don't allow any outside food in the Aquarium which is such a bummer -there are slim to none healthy choices in the cafe/eatery. I just munched on my own food (discreetly) as I went along but you can use the picnic tables outside.,Su S
30,Kids love it,Very popular with families and kids seem to love it. Excited kids create noise so avoid visiting if you are looking for a quiet time. Maybe during term time is quieter. Not a huge amount of information about the various species on display. Nonetheless some of the tanks have some really beautiful fish in them. Didn't see many big fish.,Iain M
50,Reunion on the Queen Mary,There is a free city bus that took us from the Queen Mary to the Aquarium. This Aquarium is fantastic. It is very educational and the staff are very helpful and professional. There is so much to see there.,Jan44070
50,Vacation,The Aquarium of the Pacific is a must see while you're in Long Beach have a great lunch at Bubba Gump's and then take a harbor to her,David
40,Great place Very crowded on Sunday..,Nice place to visit but very crowded during our Sunday visit. The kids enjoyed all the exhibits (especially feeding the birds and touching the sting rays),snoozeulose
40,Nice selection of sea life,Nice aquarium and good selection of animals on display. A lot of interactive petting pools for the kids. Aquarium can be very busy during the summer. Recommend getting there early during the summer months to get parking near by.,socal586
50,Lots of fun for the family,We have enjoyed going to the aquarium for about two now. Our son loves watching the fish and we always have a good time.,Flint5oh
50,Nice place!,"Excellent aquarium. Quite large. Lots of exhibits. Kind of pricey, but they do have a military discount. Overall, a nice place.",g3times
50,Really nice for adults as well,"Visited the Aquarium with a friend. We just loved it, and only hoped we would have had more time to spend there, unfortunately we were only passing through LA. It was definitely still worth a visit. The only thing we would hope to be better is the signs, sometimes we found it a bit confusing to figure out where we should be going next. We visited in the morning during a week which also seemingly was a good time for a visit as there were not too big crowds to get in the way of seeing things. Lots to see there.",Kirre
40,Wonderful Selection!,"My husband and I love to visit aquariums when traveling. This is now one of our favorites. We loved the range of animals and sea life and the hands-on experiences. My favorite part was feeding the lorikeets. We did find the map a bit confusing and the photo that was taken of us was not good - it showed all the renovations in the background, so we did not purchase it. They might want to consider using a backdrop for future pictures.",Theresa L
50,Seahorses and Sea Dragons!,"I went to this aquarium, because I saw that they had a seahorse and sea dragon promotion. I have never seen seahorses or sea dragons, and I was pleasantly surprised with the quantities that they had at this aquarium. It was a magical experience! I probably would go to this aquarium again if I was in Long Beach.",Crystal F
30,Good for kids but otherwise disappointing,"I was looking forward to visiting this aquarium but was left feeling disappointed. It did not have the wow factor that I was expecting. However, kids would love it.There were plenty of staff on hand to explain and answer questions. Also several interactive areas where you could touch live creatures.",RossOrpington
50,Interactive Too!,"Mi Familia And I also got a kick out of getting to actually pet the sea life. We try to visit this expansive learning aquarium at least every quarter, when time allows, during our many trips to Long Beach.",irishmexicanjoe80
40,Big aquarium,"This is definitely the biggest aquarium I think I've ever been to. It was a bit confusing walking around inside as a lot of the entrances looked similar. I'm unsure if a map was available but we weren't given one, this probably would've helped. Was really good for kids & we really enjoyed it, just found it a little pricey.",ChloeRachel92
50,Best aquarium we have been to...,My son is a teen so it's not always easy to entertain or get him excited...we decided (I actually decided) to check out the LB aquarium and I was so impressed! There is so many interactive stations and a lovely mixture of exhibits...any age will surely enjoy this aquarium...,Maui808Mama
50,The best aquarium I have been to!,This is the best aquarium I have been to! It is enormous with both outdoor and indoor sections. I love that the tanks are split up into zones so you learn what species are found where. We watched the sea lion show which was very popular - we were unable to get a seat! So we watched from an upper viewing area and the show was fantastic! We saw a sea lion painting! It's so good to see that keepers are making sure their animals are kept stimulated since they are kept in a captive environment. There are a few interactive areas for kids and adults alike. I particularly liked the shark touch pool outside and my niece and nephew liked that too. There are water filling stations located around the aquarium for hot days like the day we went and I like the fact the aquarium is encouraging visitors to reuse bottles. The gift shop is vast and there are so many lovely things in there! Will definitely be returning when I am next in Long Beach!,Kate S
40,Nice Aquarium,It was insanely hot outside and the aquarium was a great break from the heat. Of course in comparison with Atlanta it pales but still a nice reprieve. The sea lions were fun to watch and the shark tanks were neat to explore.,The Mama Life Blog
50,What a Day!,Went with extended family from San Francisco and thoroughly enjoyed it. There were 14 of us (8 adults & 6 kiddos ages 1 1/2 to 6 years old) Everyone had a blast! Will definitely do this again!,jimandmarie2
50,Fun on a Rainy Day,"GREAT for kids of all ages. I've taken five year olds and 90-year-olds, and plenty of children, teens and adults in between. All loved the experience.We were members for several years and now go 2-3 times a year, if we see discounts. This was a winter visit, but we also enjoy going into the chilly Northern Pacific on a hot day. The Aquarium keeps expanding and getting better every year. We most enjoy the otters, the puffins, and large aquariums with sea lions or sharks swimming overhead. Fun to go when the divers are feeding or cleaning, so when you first get there, ask for times of that and other feedings/special events when you go. The outdoor tide pools are fascinating, too, if it's sunny out.",TravelersHigh77
40,1/2 Day Trip,"Nice place, with great tanks and touch tanks for kids. Whole place can comfortably be seen in. 1/2 day.",Rene G
40,A Nice Aquarium,"We visited this place with our toddler daughter. Its a nice aquarium. There is a show going on at time we entered in which divers were in water and fishes were moving around them and we sat and watched it. There are penguins, sea lion and other sea life to be seen. There is a section for birds also. You can touch jelly fish in the pond. We liked it.",Mansi_Vij
40,Great for Toddlers,"I visited the aquarium during Labor Day weekend and it was wasn't what I expected. For starters, the parking sucks. They have a shared parking lots with the Pike Outlets and it's pretty hectic getting in and unless you score a spot from someone that is leaving, expect to park on the top level. I don't usually mind parking at the top but the elevators are very small and they get very full very fast. So that was annoying especially because we have a stroller.It was insanely hot and humid and very crowded (holiday weekend) so upon arriving it was very stuffy from everyone trying to cool off in the auditorium.There weren't as many exhibits as I thought there would be but the ones we did go to were pretty awesome. There were two reefs you could touch the fish and small sharks as well other sea life.The shark tank was our favorite! Mostly black tip reef sharks and sting rays, but still very cool.We also went into the ""bird cage"" and fed nectar to the parakeets (I think that's what they were), penguin exhibit and the seals & sea lion exhibit. All very fun and cute to see them swim. The sea otters were very playful and my daughter had a great time watching them.There is a splash zone that my toddler loved and had a great time. So we let her play as we watched and had a beer and cooled off.I would recommend coming on a weekday or early on the weekend to beat the crowds (especially parking) and the heat if you plan to visit during a southern California heatwave.",Cali_Belle87
50,Night Dives are the BEST,"I love the Aquarium, it's so relaxing, very clean and beautiful exhibits. I go as often as I can to escape the heat and just watch the fishies swim. The jelly fish and sting ray exhibits are my absolute favorite, I have to visit these every single time I am here.My favorite nights to come are the night dives, adults only 18+, there's live music, bars set up throughout the Aquarium and outside, food trucks outside with lots to choose from and great speakers and lectures to listen in on. They even have live artists. Such a beautiful place and it doesn't take the entire day to explore or break the bank.",EkJones529
50,Small but beautiful aquarium with wonderful exhibits.,"Though it's not a large aquarium and can be crowded on weekends and holidays, the Aquarium of the Pacific is beautiful and has terrific indoor and outdoor exhibits, many of which are interactive or allow touching. There is a children's play area with some water play, and there is a lot of staff on hand to answer questions and explain exhibits. The rescued sea lions, harbor seals, and sea otters are special favorites, as is the large kelp forest exhibit, the sharks, the penguins, and the jellies. Life-size models of blue and gray whales hang overhead on the main floor. There are puppet shows, films, and talks –for the compact size of the aquarium, there is a lot to do. Visitors will need at least 2-3 hours to see and do it all . The location on Rainbow Harbor is beautiful, and boats are available a very short walk away for harbor cruises and whale watch cruises. Note: the aquarium is currently building a new wing which will substantially increase its size. Definitely a must-see if you are in the Long Beach area.",Lornwal
40,We enjoyed ourselves!,"Several reviewers make comparisons to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, which is a world-class aquatic museum in our neck of the woods. The Aquarium of the Pacific is much smaller, but does a good job with what it has. The touching ponds were great, there are several of them, with a decent variety of sea life to experience. We loved the lorikeets, the seahorses, and the penguins! Because it's a aquatic park, you won't need to spend an entire day there, but it's worth a visit. If you have a young child who's interested in aquatic life, it's a must. You won't be disappointed!",Naleilehua1069

40,Great for my 2 year old,"We bought a family membership and my 2 year old is loving it so far. The staff are really great with the kids, especially on weekdays when it's less busy. There is so much to see and do, our experience is different every time! The aquarium is a nice large, clean facility with restaurants and plenty of bathrooms on site. The shoreline is also a great place to spend the day afterwards.",IMarge

50,Get close to the sea creatures!,"This is a large site. The tanks are huge and there are a diverse range of fish. You can touch the ray fish, sharks, and even jelly fish. The otters are beautiful and if you catch sight of them whilst they are swimming, you may be lucky to see them do tumble rolls in the water. You can buy a ticket to this attraction alone or there are joint tickets available for the Queen Anne cruise ship and IOWA battleship at a discount.",Lieselbee
30,Average aquarium- very busy,"This aquarium has some neat aspects to it, and it also has some shortfalls. The ticket price for general admission is a bit high. We went on labor day weekend and it was PACKED. We could barely walk through most of the aquarium. Strollers, wagons, inpatient people (and kids) everywhere!We enjoyed the visit and walked through most of it within 2 hours. It was undergoing some renovation so it was a bit unoragnized. It was a very hot day but that didn't stop people from showing up. There is a lot to see and it was pretty neat to see many of the jellifish they had on display.The giftshop is HUGE and has a lot of neat things. Leave yourself some time to browse.Parking was right across from the aquarium and it was $8 for 8 hours. If you go a minute over 8 hours you will pay $16 upto 24 hours.If you do the whale watching or harbor tour offered next door by harbor breeze, get your tickets from them directly as they offer some discounts that the aquairum combined pass doesnt.We enjoyed the aquarium but probably wont visit agan.",Derek L
40,The Behind the Scenes tour rocks!,Please take the Behind the Scenes tour! It really changes your visit from just viewing sea life (and hopefully reading something about it) to a new level. To see and understand how the aquarium functions was a true highlight for our group. All adults and teens in our group were engaged. The teens are even considering volunteer work there when they are a little older.The only downside of the visit was food service. The food service staff was overwhelmed with the needs of visitors on a busy holiday weekend.,055LavoniaD
50,A world class aquarium that is getting better every year.,I am from the Monterey Bay area and we are absolutely spoiled by the Monterey Bay Aquarium. But if you are near Long Beach do not miss the Aquarium of the Pacific. It is very very different from MBA and has many things to see that are not at MBA.,gmcb
50,Great Aqaruim!,Best Aquruim so far . Lots to do & see very educational .Totally recommend for small families.Keep the kids busy for hrs😃,Eric P
40,Small but lots of hands on,This aquarium isn't huge but its got lots of interactive options. You can pet thestingrayssharksjelly fishcrabsanenomesetc,Mark
50,Great Family Fun!,We went with the grandsons and everyone had a great time. It's especially fun to follow the kids map and collect the stamps at the various stations throughout the aquarium. I would do that even if I went alone; it was such a great way to make sure to see everything.,L774LYruthp
50,Super way to spend a few hours!!,We live in Boston and have been to quite a few east coast aquariums but believe this is the best aquarium we've ever been to. The sea horse and jellyfish exhibits alone are worth the trip - absolutely FANTASTIC! We spent over 30 minutes at the touch tanks and another 30 minutes feeding the lorikeets. Just really a great place and we will definitely be back.,26Mabel
40,Great date place,"Went on Sunday afternoon, not an optimal time for a date, but enjoyed it. Lots of families.The lorikeet exhibit was neat. Seals, sea lions, penguins, sharks, rays, jelly fish, frogs, etc. Hands on exhibits for the kids.Stop by the information booth on the way to the Aquarium ticket counter and ask for any discount coupons. We scored ones worth $8 off admission!",Gillian D
40,Neat little place,"Took the grandchild to the aquarium and had a good time. Its not the biggest but it did offer alot of interactivity for the little ones. The price for admission was reasonable and the food court offered a pretty decent menu that wasn't too bad at all although the prices were what you might expect but not absurd. Overall, a nice day spent! Also, the surrounding area offered great sights and scenery with several eating options.",Michael A
50,"Very good, not quite New England, but great day out","We spent nearly a full Friday at the aquarium, the exhibits are splendid and the staff very friendly. It lacks the scale of the New England equivalent, but is redeveloping itself. But really worth a day out, strongly recommended.",Soutanglie
50,Plenty of toddler friendly activities!,"Our toddler loves our aquarium in South Carolina so we were excited to take her to the aquarium of the pacific - she went NUTS watching the sea lions and during the sea lion show! It was very toddler friendly with areas she could climb on with soft flooring underneath, big open spaces from exhibit to exhibit, and not too many stairs she had to climb - it was all in all a really great day and this aquarium is top-notch. Easy parking too.",MsChamCham
50,making a memory,We love sea life. This is one of our favorite spots because I love the birds...locknees (?) of course all of the park.,Kathryn P
50,Long Beach Aquarium of the Pacific,"We love the aquarium and have been members for many years. We now have a ""grandparents"" membership that allows us to take our grandchildren as often as we want. With young children it is nice to go for a couple of hours on several days (rather that a one day pass where you need to see it all) The variety of marine animals is amazing and there are numerous special events throughout the year.",hasbrouck11
50,One of the best Aquariums we have been too!,We had a great time here - really top Aquarium with lots to see and do; Staff were knowledgeable and we had a good time.,Steve W
50,Exhibits were very educational and exceptional,Very cool to be able to touch the jellyfish. Sharks. And stingray. A very clean facility and employees were always around to help.,frisbywhippets
30,Aquarium,"We were a little disappointed with this aquarium. I expected it to be on a far larger scale. It was quite nice but more of a place for schools to visit, this is only my opinion. They are carrying out work to extend so hopefully it will hold more in the future.",Nicola B
50,Great Aquarium,This is a great aquarium. My favorites were the ever popular jelly fish and the sea horses. They also have otters but there were so many children and their parents next to the exhibit that we just caught a glimpse of them. There is also an aviary which we enjoyed. Beautiful fish and sea life in pristine tanks. Nice gift shop. There are also touch pools for rays and sharks which was fun.,minic00per
40,Enjoyable and educational experience,"This is a great place to take children. Entry is $30 per person. But check for deals on Exoedia. Also package tickets for the aquarium and the zoo or the harbor cruise. It is an interactive aquarium and kids can pet some of the sharks and starfish. Half of the aquarium is outside so bring a hat, sunglasses and sunblock. The shark tank is very impressive. The puffins are very cute. All in all, a very enjoyable time. Parking is eight dollars if validated at the aquarium.",vincemc
40,Great spot to learn about the ocean,The Aquarium of the Pacific is a very nice place to learn about the ocean and the creatures that inhabit it. It is easy to get to and a fun and educational place to spend much of a day.,buffalojim67
50,Summer Visit,"My family and I visited the Aquarium of the Pacific twice in three days. We tried to go on Sunday after buying a joint ticket with admission for USS Iowa and the Aquarium of the Pacific. Unfortunately, the parking in Long Beach is an absolute nightmare. There was no parking in the area at all thanks to a concert or festival. Since we were unable to park and attend the aquarium, we called and were happily told that the tickets we had could be used any day within a certain period of time. So we were able to come back on Tuesday. If you go, I highly recommend that you go as early as possible in the day and go earlier than you think to allow for time to park.Now, the aquarium itself was really well done. We thoroughly enjoyed both indoor and outdoor exhibits. We were even lucky enough to be chosen for a free behind the scenes tour. On that tour we got some insight on the exhibits, feeding of the animals, and speaking with some of the volunteer divers that help feed the fish.Overall, good experience without the parking mishap.",tink8009
50,Also for adults,Took my brothers family there and we had a great time. There is so much to do and and see. I was very impressed with the layout and architecture. Made me very proud of my home town.,Van L
30,good place to visit,It's not as good as other aquariums I have been but you won't waste your time specially worth it when they have an exhibitions.I think once per moth they have free admissions but not sure when,Roberto M
50,Worth a visit!,"What an impressive aquarium...one of the best we've seen! Very well done and maintained with plenty to do and see for all ages. The staff is knowledgeable, friendly and informative. You won't be disappointed and you get your money's worth with a 2-3 hour visit. Highly recommended!",cmd94583
30,Disappointing,"My kids took me here as part of my Mothers Day present in 2016. I was astonished at how expensive it was on a week day! While the exhibits inside were interesting, the outside exhibits were very disappointing. We didn't see all of the penguins and other creatures you see advertised on the television and overall, didn't see value in the $100+ they spent on our 3 tickets and parking. There were a ton of kids there and I know it's probably normal, but it made it difficult to enjoy the inside exhibits especially. Won't go back.",Tamara V
50,MY FAVORITE AQUARIUM BY FAR!,SO AMAZING! I love visiting aquariums when in different cities. The staff and the whole set up of the aquarium was spectacular!,L G
50,Best family aquarium,Perfect size and exhibits for our 5yo's. Lots of touch tanks and small exhibits. Follow it up with a whale watching tour toMake it a perfect day!,ElginTravelingFam
50,"Fascinating place, visit with small children or teens","Something for everyone here. Just a cool fascinating place for an afternoon. The indoor exhibits are interesting, some are mesmerizing where you can just watch for a long time. There are many hands-on things too where kids can touch many types of sea creatures. Jellyfish, sea horses, sharks, crabs, rays and so many more fascinating things to learn about. If you're AAA members you can get tickets at a discount.",Jschrier
50,The best aquarium!,I will make this review straight to the point...Aquarium of the Pacific is the best Aquarium hands down. APOP continues to update itself and we enjoy it every time we come down to LB.,Kevin G
50,Loved this,In Melbourne Australia we have a huge aquarium so any other seems small.However we did the behind the scenes tour which was great. Our tour guide was friendly and smiled the whole time. She was genuine and gave us great insight into the programs they run and how the aquarium operates.We fed the fish from above. And had an amazing time.I felt however that the seal and otter enclosures were small. Too small. But they seemed to be having a good time goofing around and the animals are all rehabilitated if possible so they are living a good life.It was a great day! Well worth a look.,AnnieS2May
40,Interesting aquarium,"A lot of different species :sea otter, seal , all kind of fishes, birdsA lot of Little annimationsGood place to visit with children",marie b
50,Conference diacount,"We got a significant discount on admission thanks to a deal offered through a conference we were attending at one of the nearby hotels. I'm not sure this place is really worth the full admission, which as of this writing, was around $30/adult. They have a good variety of marine and wildlife, including penguins, birds, sharks, and seals. Great time to go, too, on a weekend at evening and when the weather was beautiful -- it wasn't crowded at all. But compared to other, big city Aquariums that charge the same admission (think: Atlanta, Baltimore, etc.), this one was a bit underwhelming. Also, it's a nice setting, out near the marina, which made for a nice stroll afterwards.Word to the wise: go to directly to the website when checking operating hours; Google maps had it wrong.",Long-strange-journey
50,Great Aquarium,"A very nice Aquarium with two levels in the main building divided into specific Pacific gallery areas. A large outdoor exhibit area includes a shark lagoon, otter, penguin, and seal exhibits as well as other marine life.Currently they are adding a large addition to the front of the building, this construction does not interfere with visiting the Aquarium.There is also a good sized gift store with a very good selection of aquatic oriented items.Reduced parking fee is available for the parking structure across from the Aquarium.From the front of the Aquarium you have a nice view of the Queen Mary moored across the harbor.",Diane C
40,It is worth it!,"The Aquarium of the Pacific, at Long Beach, California, is very interesting, and it is different from other aquariums. There are many show rooms, with exhibitions, and there are ""shows"" scheduled at certain times of the day in certain areas around the tanks. The shows are not to put animals to do stunts. The ""shows"" are to teach for instance, how to feed, and how to take care of the different animals. The shows around the tanks are ""interactive"", and when the scuba diver is in the tank, s/he speaks with the audience/public, and answers the questions, especially from the children. There is an area where the public can ""touch"" the animals, supervised by the personnel of the aquarium. I was visiting the aquarium between 11am and 4pm, it was crowded but people flow from exhibition to exhibition, and you do not feel ""stuck"". There were many children and they speak loud, they yell, they get excited with the animals, and their moms too. So, if you do not like the ""noise"", you can bring your earphones with your favorite music, and put them on. Also there is a cafeteria if you want to eat a snack (or you can bring your own snack/food). And if you need to sit for a while, in between the exhibitions, there are comfortable chairs to rest. For us, the best part of the visit, was the ""Backstage Tour"" which you have to pay in addition to the general ticket. There are many ""Backstage Tours"" available, depending on your interests, and you need to make a reservation (time and day). With the purchase of any of the ""tours"" you can get a discount at the gift shop. We took the tour called ""Behind the Scenes Tour"" and it was very educational and exciting, because our guide took us through the backstage of the aquarium (through all those doors with a sign ""Only authorized personnel can enter"") and showed us most of the ""secrets"", and installations of the aquarium. We also could ""feed"" some of the animals (with the food that the guide gave us), we saw the ""clinic"" where the animals are taken care, the ""kitchen"" where the experts prepare the food for the animals, and many other very interesting places, that you do not even imagine, when you are visiting the aquarium from ""the other side"". The aquarium has bilingual guides (in many languages), if you need to. The staff of the aquarium is very friendly, and they are ready to help you at any time to make your visit very enjoyable. I highly recommend to visit this Aquarium of the Pacific at Long Beach, California. It is worth it!",J G
50,Under the Sea,"This was a lovely, well laid out aquarium...some of exhibits were inside and also outside. The Lorakeet birds were amazing...an outside room where you could feed them a sugar syrup...the would land on you and eat. They were beautiful colors...a fascinating exhibit.",artistgirl1129
20,Glad that I used my City Pass,"We expected more from this aquarium! We enjoyed long beach, but did not enjoy this aquarium at all. It was way too packed and there weren't many exhibits. We covered this place in an hour or less. We never plan to visit again. The only way that I would recommend others to visit is if they have the City Pass. I would have been mad had I paid additional money for admission.",Kendita
50,In Love with the aquarium 💓,Had an amazing time with my children and hubby we come here every year and it always feels like first visit love it!,Julie D
50,Great family time,This place is a great teaching environment for our kids. The tour the kids can go on and emboss the booklet for each animal or species is fundamentally needed for them to learn about these precious ecosystems of our planet and how important it is to preserve them. The hands on learning stations are great for learning and exploring of all ages. Then when you done with the Aquarium you can enjoy the pier and light house.,2DaBeach4
30,Great hands on,"We bought a Go Card LA, so we spent a day in Long Beach to get the biggest bang for our buck. We stamped our hands and took a bus to Queen Mary, no problems getting back in!I would say an hour is all you need here. Some construction but nothing too annoying. Save your trip for the afternoon. Lots of school age kids on buses in morning and early afternoon.",Lisa K
50,Awesome Aquarium,We went with a group of teens. They had a great time exploring the exhibits and the shows. This is definitely a great change from theme parks for teens if you have several days in the area. It is busy with lots of little kids but cool and shady for hot sunny days.,Paul O
50,Excellent,One of the best aquariums I've been too . Great value too as done as a combo ticket with the queen mary . One tip try to avoid all the school trips as this can be a pain with hundreds of kids with no manners,stevegollings
40,"Exterior under rennovation, go after 5 pm for discounted tickets","during summer, the aquarium is open late (8pm) and has discounted tickets. Great deal, given the size of the family crowds here. The exterior is under construction but doesn't impact the displays inside. Highlights are the ""touch labs"" where you can pet the moon jellies, crabs, anemones, and more. Easy parking in the garage across the street and validation inside the aquarium can help with the cost. We spent about 90 minutes here and saw everything.",CleopatraBunny
50,Must See for Kids if in Long Beach!,"Recently went here with the family during a trip, and was really surprised. We have been the The Shedd in Chicago, which we consider to be the benchmark for aquariums, and the Aquarium of the Pacific does not disappoint, even compared to that standard. There is plenty to see, and for a reasonable price (can easily find deals at $20 or less per person and combos with other museums/attractions).The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. They have plenty of educational volunteers that talk to the kids about the animals as well.The aquarium is currently undergoing a major construction project adding on the the facility, so be prepared for some inconvenience and some noise. It is minimal though. After seeing the models and reading about what they are building...we will definitely be back!!Parking is about $8 with a validation from the Museum.For people that are not familiar with the area, it is located right at the harbor. There are Harbor and Catalina tour bouts right outside the doors and plenty of shopping and restaurants nearby.Give yourself about 6 hours with kids to get through it all.They have a gift shop that is really large, with fair prices.Overall, a great experience that I highly recommend to ANYONE, not just folks with kids.",1776Gear
40,Nice place to understand underwater species!!!,We went with a kid.. and she enjoyed it a lot..There is a trampoline outside the aquarium.. which is kid's favorite too😊,Anandha Bharathi
40,Nice visit,This is a very good aquarium in our backyard. It's a nice day with plenty of exhibits. We took the Behind the Scenes Tour and really enjoyed seeing what it takes to keep the aquarium functional. Worthwhile area attraction to visit. Plenty of restaurants within walking distance.,GretaGarboFranklyn
30,A Great Place to go to see a sea of strollers and hear the sound of screaming children. Skip the cafe.,"NOISY AND CHAOTIC!I had seen the Aquarium of the Pacific advertised for years and finally made the trip to Long Beach for a visit.Our first mistake was going on a Saturday in the summer. The aquarium was really crowded -- mostly with families with lots and lots of strollers and young kids. (I'm not sure why people take kids that are under 5). It was not the peaceful, serene experience I'd imagined, staring into tranquil aquariums with gurgling peaceful music playing in the background, with educational talks by scientist types. No, it was a noisy, bustling, chaotic, bordering on unpleasant experience with smart phones in your face. The educators were either volunteers or under-25s in skinny jeans, their talks clearly aimed at the 4-12 year olds.GOING THROUGH A RENOVATION (SUMMER 2017)The outside is currently being renovated, so there are temporary porta-kiosks where you pay. Fortunately, we had a coupon for $8 off that we found in the Long Beach Visitor Guide, which took some of the sting out of the expensive admission. ($29.95 in 2017).GO ELSEWHERE FOR FOOD - SKIP THE SCUBA CAFEI would skip the 'Scuba Cafe' as it was just as chaotic with mediocre food. It was difficult to find a table and then we waited for our food to the sound of more screaming kids. The overly-fishy smelling fish tacos were something to put in our stomachs, but nothing to write home about. On reflection, we should have had our hands stamped and gone somewhere else.MORE RESTROOMS NEEDEDThere should be more restroom stalls for ladies as there were continuous lines outside the door. When I did finally get in a stall, (one of those with huge gaps around the edge so everyone can see in while you're doing your thing!) a yellow pool of liquid was rapidly rolling towards my feet from the stall next to me. A mother used a paper towel under her foot to mop it up, luckily right before it reached me. Ugh!THE SEA LIFEIf you can see past all the strollers and smart phones, you may enjoy the sea life. We did enjoy seeing the different exhibits about sharks, penguins, frogs, sea lions, seahorses, tropical fish, etc. Our favorites were probably the different varieties of jelly fish, especially the ones that 'light up'.EXIT THROUGH THE GIFT SHOPThere is a large gift shop with all things sea-themed, toys, books, housewares, T-shirts, key-rings, the usual touristy trinkets.GO WHILE SCHOOL IS IN SESSIONWe left the aquarium having spent about 5 hours there including time for lunch. I would recommend other child-free adults to go on a weekday during the off-season. To be honest, we were kind of glad to leave.If you found this review useful, please click the 'thank' button. Happy travels.",Don'tWaitForRetirement
40,Great!,"A wonderful facility with such a great variety of animals. Easy to spend two or three hours exploring, watching reading and learning. Two nice snack bars, nice places to sit, many hands on touch tanks and many volunteers at stations throughout the aquarium setup to teach and answer questions about all kinds of things! Parking garage right across the street. Get your tickets at a kiosk or at the office right outside. There was no line on a Tuesday in August. Several restaurants nearby as well.",MACVirginia
50,Aquarium of the Pacific,Good place to visit. Amazing 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻Near to marina and restaurant & coffee shops.Great 👍🏻 👍🏻👍🏻,Mohamed N
50,Beautiful,This location is beautiful located right up the street from Long Beach you get a nice breeze of the ocean depending on what time of the day you go to this Aquarium the inside has everything you could ever dream of I highly suggest taking a chance and visiting this Aquarium,Peter M
40,Get there early,"The aquarium is very popular with schools and camps, so if you get there too late the glass will be covered with fingerprints. This is a very nice aquarium. It has great standing exhibitions and rotating special interest exhibitions. They are in the process of expanding the auditorium and art displays. I wish they were expanding the aquarium displays instead.",Bob K
30,Life-sized blue whale,"Best part of the aquarium can be seen online, the life-sized blue whale. Second best thing was Google Earth on a big screen. We saw the pine needles on our roof. Better than the Houston downtown aquarium, but nothing compared to the Dallas World Aquarium. $70 for a family of four (the baby was free) and that doesn't include parking. I wouldn't visit again.",angelhH104VA
20,Too loud and crowded,Maybe I was expecting too much. But the place was packed to the gills with loud people and the exhibits too small to enjoy in such a crowd. Monterey Aquarium is huge but even in summer you can find quiet peace to watch the tanks. That just wasn't the case here. And why have lorikeets to feed in an aquarium? Just another way to make $4. We spent longer parking than we did in the aquarium.,Hazel B
50,A great place to visit!,Bought an after hours ticket no spent a few hours viewing the exhibits. A ton of exhibits in great shape and the inhabitants were well taken care of. A must see if in the Long Beach area. The outside bird exhibit was awesome!,David P
40,Great aquarium!,"We had a nice day at the aquarium. Get the nectar in the Lorikeet exhibit, it was fun to feed the birds. One jumped on my shoulder as we walked in! The exhibits were well done and we had a great time.",Leslie H
50,Great time,"Had my granddaughter in town and she loved this place. Plan on about 3 hours but the place is layed out well, clean, open and has great exhibits.Plenty of parking in the garage next door and lots of restaurants for a meal before or after.I had discounted tickets but a little pricy at $30 for adults and $18 for kids. They have several packages that seem to be a better deal including, local museums, the la zoo, harbor cruises and a few others.Easy to spend most of the day here and shoreline village",rcaldin
50,Don't Miss This Aquarium!,"A group of us decided to try the Aquarium out. So glad we did! Truly enjoyed the variety of the displays, and the educational aspects were impressive.On top of that, the staff was very kind, patient, and extremely helpful. My encounter with them was very pleasant.I used to have season passes for SeaWorld, and your Aquarium was a wonderful experience even so. I plan to return and visit again!",Pinman59
40,Nice to visit at least once,My wife and I never visited here and we have done nearly everything in SoCal. Nice to visit for a half day. Haven't visited an aquarium since I was a kid so it was nice. Best to go when kids are in school.,zavalaphilam
40,Quick and fun.,"It's not the biggest aquarium in the world, but I'd recommend it if you have 2 to 3 hours to kill. Some of the activities proposed are really fun, too.",Bachir H
50,Amazing place,Very beautiful aquarium with a lot of rare species. Amazing part was we can touch some of the sea animals :) it was really wonderful. Also there were ample number of courteous volunteers to help.Since we visited on weekend that too on summer vacation it was too crowded.,GiriBhat
40,Great aquarium,"A very nice aquarium. We spent about a half a day there. Good variety of local and more exotic fish. Good plexiglass viewing areas which enthralled kids of all ages. The otters and lorikeets are always a hit. Parking across the street. Food available at ""amusement park"" prices.",MinnesotaFamily2
40,Great Activity if Not crowded,"My mother and I took my five year old niece to the Aquarium for a special trip. The best decision we made was to arrive early! When we entered at 9:05am we got a parking spot a two minute walk to the entrance and had the place almost all to ourselves. By 10:30 the place was jam packed.We spent about 3.5 hours, including lunch. We ""splurged"" $3 on the 15 minute 3D (4D?) turtle video.My niece kept telling me she was scared but after it was over she said she loved it. I think you have to be 5 to appreciate it. The touch pools were the best part. The interactive animal information sessions left me wanting more close up interactions. If you go to the Larakeet bird exhibit and want the birds to land on you , spend the $4 on bird nectar at the kiosk before you enter.Overall - It was a fun morning. Worth it to get there early. Had we gotten there at 1pm, this would have been a very different review.",Chanybean
50,Delightful Aquarium,"I would highly recommend visiting this wonderful aquarium. Wonderful tanks and selections of sea life, very well laid out.",eternal411
40,Very cool place to visit,"This place is cool to visit with the kids, they will love all the exhibits we loved all the jelly fish tanks and the touch pools where you can touch rays sharks anemones starfish and sea unchins. The gift shop is cool as well where you can find souvenirs for everyone!!!",Jose Alonso C
50,So many touch pools!,"This aquarium is much bigger than it looked from the outside. Plenty to see and touch! There were a lot of touch pools, which is great. I loved the seals, Lorikeet (birds) and jellies. It makes for a great day.",Mathieu M
40,Worth a visit,"Long Beach is worth a visit from downtown LA, and can be easily reached via the metro train. There's lots of shops, restaurants and bars plus the Aquarium of the Pacific. As far as aquariums go, this one is good - but perhaps not up there with the best. Children will enjoy the seahorse, jellyfish and sea lion exhibits. Plus the option to touch baby sharks and rays in the outdoor pools. There's also a shark tunnel you can walk through. For refreshments, there's a couple of cafés on site, including a Starbucks.",louisej856
30,Not totally impressed,"This aquarium has a variety of animals to see and even touch. The staff is knowledgeable and can help answer any questions. However, I was not totally impressed and thought it wasn't quite worth the price. If you're older/an adult and don't have kids, I would definitely recommend going in the later afternoon/evening. We visited during the day and it was unbelievably crowded. There were tons of strollers taking up walkways, children blocking and tapping on glass tanks, etc. that were really ruining the experience.",Trish E
40,Hands-on Fun Galore!,"The aquarium is clean and beautiful. The student interns working there are super knowledgeable and great with the kids. The displays and aquariums are well-kept and easy to access. Feed your kids before going because there's a lot of walking and reading to do (if you do it right). There is a cafe inside and a snack/coffee stand. The kids were able to touch sharks, sting rays, and other squishy plant life (which they LOVED). We learned a lot reading the displays and accessing videos. The restrooms were clean and there's a nursing area for mothers. I suggest you purchase the $4 nectar outside to feed the birds (they hop on your arm to eat!). The outside petting area could use a face-lift, but the kids don't know that. Overall, a great experience.",Road_Family915
50,Great aquarium!,This is a great aquarium with plenty to see for the entire family. They have a great jellyfish display. We could watch the sea otters for hours. The have an nice area outside to watch the animals.,1466martin
50,Worth it with young kids - bought the membership,"We have a 2 year old and one more on the way. My son loves the aquarium, we ended up buying the membership just because it made sense. The cost is reasonable, $109 for two adults, you can purchase discounted parking and it makes for a great visit during the week or early/late on weekends. Weekends can be VERY busy and I don't enjoy it when it's very full. But the Aquarium has a bunch of great events and special late hours and now with my membership I can attend with my family anytime.My son loves all the exhibits and is learning more and more every time we go which is another great bonus.",JesseGuzman86
40,Unexpected positive surprize,"On a business trip to Los Angeles, I flew into the Long Beach airport, stayed in Long Beach, had a few hours off, and visited to this aquarium by chance.I was positively surprised ! From the impressive life-sized grey whale in the entrance hall to the tropical tunnel, this aquarium did a great job.I especially liked the penguin, sea otter, and sea lion encounter - it seemed to me that they were both animal friendly and immersive / interesting for visitors. While, there were some parts that I didn't really like (such as the touch pool), this aquarium is one of the best I've visited.The area around the aquarium is also really nice: a beautiful park, many restaurants & shops (a mall), a harbor, movie theater, and a lighthouse.This review is based on a 2009 visit.",LukiLukeGO
50,Amazing! Go Early to avoid the crowds,I wasn't sure what to expect but I was pretty Blown Away by the variety of sea creatures...There are galleries of specific areas of the ocean... so you see fish and invertebrates from that region of the ocean.The water and the aquarium glass is very clear so you can take great photos be sure to turn off your flashIt took us 3 hours to see everythingWe added in the $10 harbor tour boat ride which was somewhat interesting but not nearly as good as the boat ride in Coronado which goes by the battleshipsParking was $8$29 for tickets to the aquarium for adultsKids were like 16 bucksFood prices were pretty good in the Cafes...Here's a tip instead of watching the sea lion show from the cement benches go to the scuba Cafe and watch it through the glass window in the air conditioning while you eat a snackHighly recommend this Aquarium ...we will be back for it again next time we're nearbyWe were lucky enough to catch the Frog Exhibit. .. the poison arrow dart frogs are extremely tiny but well worth looking at sea photo,Vegasphotoman1
30,Was alright,"I guess we were expecting so much more to the Aquarium, some nice exhibits to see and the ponds that have the rays and sharks are really the highlight I think. You get to actually touch them, so that was pretty neat. We got in for free with the LA Go Card, if we had to pay we would have been disappointed. We were thinking there would be some larger mammals to see.",Stephen J
20,Screaming Children Everywhere!,"Great facility, but overrun with Summer Day Camp field trips on the Tuesday I was there. The absolute worst part was the horribly-run restaurant called Cafe Scuba. I have never seen such disorganization. You have to wait in separate lines for different kinds of food, instead of having it combined. So, if you want soup, you wait in one long line. If you want a burger, you have to wait in another line. The whole thing was mind-boggling. We needed a drink afterward, but they only serve beer. No wine. If you are gluten intolerant, you are out of luck.",RaymondD
40,Great day out,"Highly recommend the multi-ticket option to take the whale watching tour alongside visiting the aquarium.We had a great time walking around the aquarium itself before going on the whale watching tour which was amazing, saw whales and dolphins and the guides were great.",Grace Kyte
40,You can touch the animals!,"Do this with children, they will love it.You get the chance to touch crabs, sharks and jellyfish.They also have a huge shark tank with some amazingly large fish.",Sander V
40,So much to see,There is no shortage of displays here. Spent 4 hours looking through all the displays and watching some of the educational shows. There were many families with strollers that tended to create traffic issues. Flow is not the greatest and you have to do a lot of crossing and back and forth. Would like a better map. But worth the time if you have several hours.,Tucson M
30,Aquarium,"The aquarium of the Pacific is ok really crowded if you have small children and go on a weekend carry them or they will get trampled on,the Best Time to take small children is on a weekday so they can enjoy",John D
40,Nice but crowded,"We visited on a Sunday in July. We purchased the Aquarium/Queen Mary combo tickets. Early on, the Aquarium was nice. As it got later in the day, the more crowded it got. The selection of fish is great. The ability to talk with divers is cool. The short movies provided a great place to cool off and escape the crowds.",sharon m
50,Fun amd interesting venue for a business function,"The Aquarium of the Pacific was a very interesting venue to hold a conference welcome party. With so many exhibits and a great hall to mingle with others, this place was very memorable.",John C
40,Good but not great!,This was our first visit! There are many things to do and see. My 7year old really enjoyed it especially the touch tanks and feeding the birds. From a parents perspective it wasn't so enjoyable. Way...way to many people! It made it extremely difficult to keep tract of my kiddo much less learn anything from the exhibits. It was also a very warm day...seems like the ac for the aquarium couldn't keep up so it was warm even on the inside. We definitely won't be going back anytime soon and if we do maybe we will visit in the off season.,Heather T
20,Small and disappointing,"If you're looking for again fabulous Aquarium, this ain't it. It's small and disappointing compared to the really great Monterey Bay Aquarium. I say save your $ for a nice meal or another activity.",joicebiles
40,Well worth the visit,"My grandkids enjoyed being able to touch the various sharks; it is very informative and interesting. Allow at least 3 hours, more to fully enjoy the various shows. My 12 year old grandson wants to go when he has time to read all the information about each display.",Pat P
40,Great for families with kids,"We have been there many times, it is in a nice location, the tickets are not too pricey but you do have to pay for parking. A family with small children could spend a lot of time here and enjoy themselves.",Lenin T
50,Unique and amazing!,"From the moment you enter, you will be amazed at all the different and amazing exhibits. There are plenty of things to do for children as well. I highly recommend spending some time to see this!",dmdobler
50,Great place to take kids,Great place to take kids and help them learn about marine life. Took church kids to this place and enjoyed it. Lots of things to see and activities to do.,rasjve
50,Great for kids and adults of all ages,So much to see! Fun shows. The behind-the-scenes tour is amazing. Lovely location - close to good food.,rebevworldcitizens
40,Beautiful Waterlife,We went after 6 pm for the reduced rates ($15)during the summer and bought our tickets online. It took me time to adjust to the large crowd and intensity of all the children. We took the free shuttle bus to avoid $8 parking rate. The upstairs exhibits were beautiful and the crowds were fewer. The tropical reef was colorful. They told me if you want to avoid crowds come at its opening. Well worth going.,Linda C
40,Fun with the grandkids,"Nice for the entire family to visit. A great learning experience too. Amusement park food and drink prices can be a little pricey if you purchase there. With membership we purchased the prepaid parking tickets, but confused about having to scan it to get the discount. Therefore, wasn't able to use on our first visit and paid full price. Will try next visit.",fktolentino59
50,One of the Better Aquarium,"Very nicely organized and display of the sea biodome.Great place for everyone to spend some time.The aquarium was very interesting and well presented. There were a lot of people, including children, couples, singles, school groups, and families.Everyone seem to enjoy this place well.",Venetian25
30,Disappointing and rather small,Parking is perfect. Nice cool garage and flat rateIt was quick to get in. everything looked a bit old. Not that much animals. Atmosphere was bit wear down. Not really worth the entrance fee.,eric h
40,Great Exhibit,What a great aquarium! We showed up on a day with ton's of school field trips and there was plenty of room to scatter out. They have things you never see at other aquariums,ArizonaTraveler56
50,Never get tired of this place!,"We visit overtime we are in town. We all love it. Always something new to see. The ""touch tanks"" are always the highlight. Take one of the boat trips while here. The Whale watching trip is great value and great fun - even if you are not fortunate enough to spot a whale. This is a must see attraction.",Markybritt
40,Nice Aquarium,"The aquarium was very nice, with all the people, children, school groups, crowds, it would have been nice to have staff monitoring crowd control as areas were over crowded and not flowing through at a good pace. Exhibits were all nice. Merchandise was overpriced.",AvaTennessee1
50,Fantastic!,"Great for kids and adults alike. Informative, entertaining and absolutely worth every penny! There are volunteers and employees everywhere throughout to answer every question your little one can think to ask with infinite patience. A long beach treasure!",Robin S
50,Aquarium Visit,It was our first time visiting this aquarium. Parking is a bit pricey but they validate if you are staying for more then 2 hours it is cheaper then paying at the kiosk. Some of the exhibits were closed when we visited but the place was clean and staff was friendly! Great aquarium for everyone!,Sierra T
50,recommended by friends... totally worth the traffic.,"I asked some friends who live in LA where we should take our toddler while we were in town. They recommended the Aquarium of the Pacific. It was about a 45 minute drive from Beverly Hills, and was totally worth the drive.Our 22 month old loved every second. It has indoor and outdoor exhibits. The staff were friendly and helpful. Plentiful and convenient parking. Looking forward to a return visit",Mark Dean-Goodman
50,fun and beautiful,"We love this aquarium! We have taken our kids here twice. Our favorites are the sharks, birds that you feed with the nectar, and the sea lions. Great for kids with lots of interactive activites and things they can touch. Great information about the sea life. Great location next to the ocean and lots of restaurants and shopping near by, plus the marina, and the queen mary. We just love this location with lots to do and the aquarium is a must!",Laurel N
30,Mediocre,"Not the best aquarium we've been in. No comparison to the likes of Dubai or Singapore. It's obviously popular but far too many 'Single Type' viewing ports throughout this attraction, therefore you can become bored quite quickly.The open air pools allow visitors hands to come into contact with various species of fish which I wasn't impressed with - I'm more of a look-see person and leave the fish alone.All in all, a good way to spend a couple of hours whilst down Longbeach way.",Charlie M
40,Great place to visit,Been here a few times and live the jelly fish exhibit . Sea horses are cute. Best time to visit during weekend days so not as crowded and get to see everything.Parking about $12. Few spot for electric car to charge .Fun,jt93664
50,Awesome and always getting awesomer!,"It is a well organised and well maintained facility. The people who work there are enthusiastic about their jobs. You will learn a great deal about the ocean without feeling like you're learning. When I lived in California, I had a season pass. I never got tired of visiting.",underwater
40,great site to see,"I live outside of Chicago and have visited our Aquarium, but this one is so different. Very informative and beautiful sites inside. They have many touch and explore areas for children. Also informative show about the fish. Many areas showed different types and sizes of jellyfish which really amazed me. Great place you must visit. Loved it would diffently do again. Also very handicapped friendly, with wheelchairs available.",monarn1
40,Aquarium of the Pacific (Disneyland break),Nice place to visit during after a couple days at Disneyland. Lots of sea creatures to view and one can even pet a stingray and touch a jellyfish. A bit expensive but there is an online option for free kids (max 4) for every paid adult.,biggarbob
50,great experience,a little crowded on the day we went (fathers day) but otherwise a great place to spend the day and something of interest for all ages.,Shirley S
50,Great aquarium,"It's a amazing place for family, kids, couples. There's a lot o activities for all ages and the animals are great. You can't miss it!",Laura d
50,Fun and educational!!,Great place to go for both adults and children. You can bring your own food into the aquarium which is a nice perk. The staff is friendly and the exhibits are great. Lots of touch pools which the kids loved. Cute animals!!,BnRadventures2015
50,Amazing,This is one of the finest aquarium's in the United States. The exhibits are exceptional and the staff take pride in the facility. Everyone will find something of interest at this fine facility. Great place to spend a 1/2 to 1 day.,Ebazinam
50,One of the best!,We tend to stop by any aquarium when we are travelling so have seen quite a few. This one is way up there for me. I really encourage you to visit their website to see details of what exactly they have because it is a lot and I will probably get it wrong. Just know there is a lot to see here and worth the trip/money.,Lovefancyhotels
50,Nice aquarium for all ages. Beautiful!,"If visiting Long Beach, definitely worth looking at but I felt a little costly for the time spent there.",PBinSD
50,You must visit the Aquarium!,I visited this place with family and loved it! the displays were awesome and the commentaries are very interesting. Good place to take the kids for a visit!,Joe Alejo
50,Good value,"Plenty to see and well presented with as much information as you care to take in! There were excellent shows with feeding of sharks, penguins and otters. This aquarium was considerably cheaper than others in the area.",JawLeicester
30,Borderline Overpriced,I visited the aquarium on some downtime and would consider it an average facility which makes the ticket prices seem to be on the high side. The exhibits are nice and the facility is clean. I am sure kids think it is awesome but make sure they are fed and hydrated to avoid way overpriced concessions while inside.,mpiorier
40,Fun -and love that the animals are rescued!,Fun and interesting exhibits! Enjoyed our time. Loved the otters and the moon jelly touch exhibit. Great location.,ManquehueRivers
40,Family membership,"We purchased a family membership around November 2016 for $100 and we've already used it for more than 5x! We just love the aquarium, we would go there everyday if we lived in that area.We've went on different days, best day I would say would be the weekdays of course and go there early just so you'd be able to see and enjoy the place before foot traffic hits! Our most recent visit was just this Father's Day and it was packed to the point that we were stuck at one area with strollers coming in and out of different directions.Anyway here are some tips I think might help your family enjoy it.1. Buy tickets online (may it be single entry or a membership, you can call their number for assistance) to avoid lining up outside, especially this summer.2. While your online, check their program schedule. There are several performances from the sea creatures you can watch. Plan ahead and make sure you get to catch all of them (seating is limited I'd say you better perch up 10 minutes before the show starts)3. Try to come early, while you can still take an awesome family picture before it gets too crowded4. If you have a toddler, bring them a swimsuit, spare clothes and a towelette (if you dont wanna buy from their store) because you betcha they are going to get wet from either playing with the small water ""park"" or from touching the jellyfish, sharks, stingrays, starfish and sea anemones.5. If you get too hot or too tired, we always crash in front of the otter display. they have a few benches there you could rest and watch cute silly otters play, swim and wrestle with each other6. Look out for secret tunnels! There's one at the penguin display. ;)",casm
50,Fun at the aquarium,This is a great aquarium. The touch tank is so much fun. Not a bird person but the have a great bird section. Huge gift store. Must stop if in LB!,beachtraveler345
50,Awesome Aquarium!!!,"This place has a great layout and a great collection of jellyfish and sea dragons. The leafy sea dragons are spectacular! They also have sharks, starfish, penguins you name it! Great place to go solo or with friends and absolutely kid friendly. Anytime I have a friend visiting from out of town I always bring them here and they really enjoy it. I highly recommend!",Michelle C
50,Love this place,"We've been members here for a long time and really enjoy this excellent Aquarium. The variety of habitats and all the animals are the best part of the facility - this is a top level aquarium that has touch ponds, for bat rays, small sharks, and other animals. The penguins and sea otter are many people's favorites, but we really like the large seals and sea lions. The penguin display has a lot of photo spots, with the sculptures of different species, the glass ""walk-under"" portion of the penguin tank, and the accessible tank itself where anyone can get eye-level with a penguin. this is excellent for young children",RangerBobN
50,Fascinating place,"We recently spent several hours at this aquarium. We are a retired couple and we went without our grandchildren but we really enjoyed our visit. The fish were beautiful to see, especially the graceful jellyfish. There were several large groups of school kids at the time which really raised the noise level but we did not mind. As others have mentioned, they all leave in the early afternoon. Feeding the lorikeets was quite an adventure, be sure to realize that they will swarm you when you enter with food. I was not prepared for approximately 8 birds landing on my head, back , shoulders and arms so it was a bit frightening. They have an employee posted right by the entrance who helped get it all under control.",KipDylan
50,Be surprised to see out of the ordinary sea creatures,This is a lovely place to spend an afternoon with a date or family even. It has a nice variety of all kinds of sea creatures that you don't normally see which is quite enlightening. Definitely worth the visit!,Nas S
50,Fun for the entire family.,What a great place. So much to see and do. There are amazing displays of fish. Petting areas outside. So much to learn about. I have been to several aquariums by far this is my favorite!,m0mmy04
50,"Nice Aquarium, family friendly","We visited the aquarium and enjoyed the interactive exhibits, even though the line can get a little long on some of them. The place was clean with a variety of exhibits. We would recommend stopping by, but allow at least 2 hrs for it.",LMVtravel
50,Worth a Visit,The aquarium is small but has a lot of activities. It is good for children and boasts a few animal shows. There is a small touch pool. The otters are beautiful to watch. The restaurant within the aquarium is awful so eat beforehand. The gift shop is quite large.,Nattie J
30,Jellyfish were a hit,"The aquarium is VERY busy on the weekends, especially during a special event. It was shoulder to shoulder crowded! Yikes! If it weren't for the outside area I would have turned right around and left. Luckily, the jellyfish pool (you get to touch them!!) and the shark area were a hit with the kids (and husband).",Marchelle TV
50,"Worth A Visit, But Go Early - Behind The Scenes Tour Worth It","My daughter and I visited on a Saturday. We got there about 10AM as we had a behind the scenes tour scheduled at 11AM. So before the tour we walked around and got through most of the bottom areas of the aquarium. We met the tour guide at 11AM and there were only 7 people on the tour which is great. We headed to the back areas and up above the super large tanks. It is a totally different view looking down on the sea life and since we were already down below, we realized how they separate the areas. They show you the food they feed, the food they have to grow and some of the sea life they have to keep separated. Overall, this was a great tour, very worth the money. After we were done, we started back walking through the aquarium however by now, it was triple the amount of people. So not as easy to get up close to the glass and see things with all the kids. So I would recommend you go early if you want good pics. My daughter did the petting of the sting rays and jelly fish. We also walked through the bird area. All in all, we both had a great time! I would recommend the Aquarium of the Pacific.(To Travel Is To Live)",JohnnyOxnard
50,AMAZING!,"My family and I love this aquarium! The staff is so friendly and knowledgeable. And, the exhibits are really interesting. It's a really gem for families with children that love the creatures of the sea! The snack bar is good, too! You could spend a whole day here!",Caroyln S
50,"One of the finest, if not THE finest, in California.","I've taken my kids to this aquarium on two different occasions. I always take extra care to research and arrive during their least busy period. If you're in the midst of several school field trips then it can definitely seem chaotic and a bit overwhelming, but thankfully my little ones have been able to enjoy each trip and soak in all the complex has to offer. The size, variety, and quality of the exhibits are appropriate for a visit lasting around a couple hours, perfect for us. The facilities, grounds, and staff are always top notch. The staff are sweet and accommodating. My son, an inquisitive and vocal 5 year old at the time, knew so much info about the touch pool animals that the staff was ready to hand over her microphone to him :) Wonderful aquarium.",latindrummer2112
50,"Beautiful, educational and inter-active","Went to the Long Beach Pacific Aquarium with son and 4 year old grand-daughter. When you first enter the building you notice a large whale hanging from the ceiling and a wall of glass to your right to see fish. Many inter-active sites throughout the facility. She made it rain in Los Angeles by pushing a ball, found out which animals were in danger of extinction or already extinct , touched a skate and an otters pelt. At the otter site, staff talked about habitat, behavior and brushed the otter's teeth. We saw an 8 foot skate, a large shark with 3 rows of bottom teeth, beautiful exhibits of jellyfish, starfish, fish, coral, anemones, octopus and giant king crabs. The Pacific Aquarium has inside and outside exhibits. The sea lions had outdoor stadium seating which offered a good view, sit and listen to staff yet children could get up close to see the animals. The grand-daughters favorites were the penguins. At this location there was a life size 4 foot King penguin and two smaller ones with a photographic wall of their habitat. It was a great place for a photographic moment. My favorite was the leaf dragon which appeared to be a beige skeleton with leaves attached to its appendages. I never knew such a thing existed. The gift shop prices were reasonable at $8 for octopus or shark hat or a variety of stuffed animals.My son purchased a membership for $139.00 which allows 2 adults and 2 children unlimited access for a year. He also bought a parking ticket package for $20. Since it is a non-profit facility, this expenditure was tax deductible. We were there for over 3 hours and loved it.",Victoria A
40,"Nice Aquarium, not to big",I have been here several times. This time it was very busy with field trips and kids. I had booked a 1:30 tour so we were obligated. I wish I would have known there were so many kids. I thought they would have been out of school. Arizona kids get out late May. I was surprised at the amount of kids.,busy_mom_in_peoria
50,Family visit,Excellent place. Lots of things to see. We were able to pet sharks and sting rays. Very friendly staff.,Honor C
50,Fantastic,"We've been to several Aquariums around the world in our travels and this one ranks very near the top. Well worth a visit with the kids. The jelly fish exhibits are particularly awesome, as well as the sea horses. Highly recommend.",Oilerman
40,I don't like aquariums and I wasn't bored,Took my friends kids and was a great way to kill a few hours. Lots for the kids and enough to see for the adults to keep it interesting. Expensive if you don't have a membership.,jshu703
40,Fun visit,Visited the Aquarium with my daughter using our Go La pass . We loved the seals exhibit and my daughter found the extinction exhibit very informative . Overall we really enjoyed our Long Beach day trip with the Aquarium being a highlight of our trip . Just a tad bit crowded on the Saturday late afternoon but we still had fun our trip .,glm03
40,Hanging in Long Beach pre-flight home...,"Our flight back to Massachusetts was at 9 pm so we spent the day in the Long Beach area. (we were originally going to spend a night on the Queen Mary but with all of the talk about structural problems etc, opted not to but could see it from the aquarium). I picked up discount passes at the Anaheim AAA office (we stayed in Anaheim for the week) they were $23 per adult. It's a nice aquarium with the usual displays of sea/bird life. Plenty of hands on areas...we pet sharks and ray. There was also a tidal pool area. There were also some shows/movies to see. LOTS of people there...LOTS of strollers and little ones to maneuver around. Good place to spend an hour or two and learn a lot. The aquarium is located near a shopping area(The Pike Outlets) and restaurants, as well as docks for boats to go on harbor tours and whale watches. Some on street parking, there were also parking garages--the Aquarium garage was full so we parked in the Pike Outlets garage --scanned our ticket at the aquarium and it only cost us $8 to park for about 4 hours! Remember to take a picture or write down where you parked your car...lol The Queen Mary and a cruise ship were visible from the area. About a 15 min ride to Long Beach airport.",5kaddict
50,Great way to explore the Pacific Ocean (without getting wet),"As a local, I have been to the Aquarium of the Pacific many times. It is situated near downtown Long Beach and the ocean, where there is a lovely walk near the boats, and also restaurants nearby. The aquarium is beautifully designed. The exhibits are divided into the different areas of the Pacific Ocean, displaying the varied fish and sea life that lives there. A popular activity is when divers go into the large tanks and give information about the fish to the visitors on the other side of the glass, The aquarium is a great place for the whole family to visit.",AlaskaCA
50,So many things to see and do at the aquarium!,"I'm not going to lie, the first thing I do when I get to a zoo/museum/aquarium is look at the size of their gift shop. It was the same size as their enormous blue whale replica hanging from the ceiling: it's going to be a good day. I'd been to Long Beach, but I hadn't even realized there was an aquarium there. Good thing my cousins knew better! Parking? Easy peasy, across the street and $8 flat rate. Exhibits? Rare, deadly frogs? I'm in! Baby jellyfish the size of your pinky nails? Yes, please. Sea dragons, lorikeets (well aware that's not from the ocean), huge maps, enormous salt water tanks, places to sit (hello, hot pretzels), clean restrooms. This place is a definite destination. The fact that there's a lovely boardwalk nearby is a plus.",kcdenman
50,Great way to spend a few hours - even without kids,"Very nice aquarium. Great collection of creatures, nice layout. The Aviary with the Lorikeets was wonderful. Entire venue laid out nicely, with plenty of space.. never felt crowded. Tanks with sea creatures and fish beautifully populated with plants, etc.. scenes look so natural and colorful.",LandedInRoundRock
50,Great aquarium,Really enjoyed our day here -- cool wildlife and lots of variety - only negative was sea lions / seal exhibits were closed --- but very good everything else -- best aquarium we have been to,Hibby922
50,The Aquarium has grown,"We visited the Aquarium of the Pacific when it first opened back in, I think 1998. It was so small then, and it took all of 45 minutes to complete. We were pleasantly surprised today, the Aquarium has grown and the exhibits are educational. We spent 3 hours and could have stayed longer if we had had the time. The local schools were having field trips today, and it was a delight to watch the kids try to interact with the sea life.",devaandrews
40,Nice Aquarium in a nice location,"The previous reviews do a very good job describing the attraction. This is a nice aquarium that attracts legions of little kids. The aquarium is small, but very informative and well staffed. If you have little kids then this is a great place to spend some time.",Kyle_SD_308
30,Good place for kids,"We have been to several aquariums, and this one was OK, but nothing that really stood out. It is smaller than Monterrey Bay or the Georgia Aquarium. It was completely overrun with kids in the morning, almost empty in the afternoon. All of the guides were very friendly.",Chuck Brooks
40,Best aquarium in Southern California,"Before my recent visit it had been 5 years since I had last been to the aquarium and overall I think it has improved very well. I have been to the Monterey bay, Georgia, Birch, Sea World, and many other aquariums and I can say this is the 3rd best aquarium I have ever been to with Georgia and Monterey taking the top 2 places. This aquarium excels with their touch tanks, jellyfish galleries, shark tank, and seals and sea lions. Also they have smaller exhibits that are quite interesting, the mudskippers were unexpected and really cool. The only downsides to the aquarium is that it isn't the biggest place ever, but it doesn't have to be and the new frog exhibit was a let down because most of the amphibians were hiding underneath a plant but as time goes by they probably won't be as shy. I can't wait to come back here and this is well worth a visit, especially if you are wanting to visit an aquarium in Southern California and aren't a huge fan of sea world and even if you are this is a nice aquarium that you should probably check out. Also I should mention in 2019 their expansion building will be complete and will feature more creatures and screens which should be really awesome.",darkfalcon500
40,"Nice, but crowded","I arrived at opening and had a very nice first hour and a half, as it was almost like having the place to myself. Once more people started arriving, however, the place became packed to the gills with screaming children and parents who seemingly had no desire to monitor the children. This is no fault of the aquarium, but something I feel guests should be prepared for....there was a lot of pushing and being jostled around as children would just push their way in front of me to see animals and shows, and there was much banging on glass, screaming, and stepping on toes.As for the exhibits themselves, they are well put together, and the animals display are interesting. There is great educational value here as well, in the theater shows, dive shows, animal encounters, and displays. A definite highlight are the many touch tanks (more than I've seen anywhere else), which allow you to (gently) touch rays, sharks, urchins, snails, starfish, anemone, and even jellyfish! Another highlight are the staff and volunteers, who are all polite, friendly, and extremely knowledgeable. I would definitely recommend the aquarium if you're in the area, but would also recommend arriving early and taking advantage of the quiet time before the masses descend!",VacationerGuy
30,"Fascility kids can enjoy, old guys too.","Since Long Beach is facing pacific, here is where to come. The cold pacific flows from the allue to offshore Canada, down to California.You can have divergence of cold underwater. Group of few families with kids can be a wonderful trip memory.",Tsuyoshi M
50,Soooooo cool,A very very neat place...really good exhibits.......watch the shows with the scuba divers. A lot of school groups the day we went....still not bad on lines and stuff..,Billy B
30,JUST OK!! We aaw it all in a few hours!,"So we absolutely loved the staff and I was impressed by the beauty. The diversity of sea creatures was appreciated. The outdoor aquarium and water cycle display were just ok. I mean the viewing window are calcified so we could barely see the shares except from an overhead view. It's easy to be bored here even for an ocean enthusiast such as myself. Kids got bored too. I think if we were coming to take notes and really study the fish etc it would be better. Almost forgot to add that we really enjoyed the Earth room (if that's what it's called) the lecturer showed us how a tsunami propagates itself forward and that was cool to see. Overall, I don't feel any need to go back. Unfortunately not worth the money and we had season passes but just didn't want more.",Le Le Q
50,Wonderful Ocean Exhibits,"I love the teaching stations at The Aquarium of the Pacific. I have come here many times with my special education students over the years. Now, as a retired teacher, I am enjoying the aquarium all over again with my two year old grand daughter. Yesterday was my second visit with her and it was especially wonderful sharing her excitement and sense of wonder as she experienced the touch tanks and watched the presentations. I can't wait for our next visit.",ginaspicks
40,Great Way to Spend a Few Hours,"Nice size, well maintained and nicely layed out aquarium. Super job on the exhibits, many of which are interactive, which the kids love. I was there in a Friday morning, and there had to be at least a thousand children in the facility. I was later told that when school- and other groups are there, they tour in the morning, are fed lunch, and are gone shortly thereafter. My next trip will take this into account, as it was difficult to enjoy touring the aquarium with so many mini-disrupters present. And look, I do enjoy children, just not that many at a time.",Roger F
40,Long Beach Aquarium,This is right on the coast in Long Beach. It is a small aquarium but has lots of hands on stuff for kids. They have more jellyfish species than I have ever seen - so that is way cool. Also they have a number of different seahorse species as well - that is also very cool. If you have a couple of hours that you need to kill - this is a great place to go.,Lin P
40,"Jellies, jellies, jellies!","While this aquarium has many of the beautiful fish that you expect to see, the most fascinating and outstanding exhibits were those of graceful, colorful jellyfish. The exhibits were truly mesmerizing. Another exhibit of special interest was the outdoor stingray pool that contained one of the largest stingrays imaginable. There was also a ray habitat touchpool and a moon jelly touch lab. We arrived in the late afternoon but we suggest that you visit earlier to take advantage of tours. There is a parking garage in close proximity to the aquarium. Chain restaurants are nearby. We saved the price of an adult admission by taking advantage of a two-for-one coupon found in the entertainment book series for this area. This visit was our third time at this aquarium since it opened years ago and it won't be our last.",Debra-Lynne T
50,But we do also. The diplays are,"We've visited the aquarium many times, and each time we find something else to amaze us.Especially my grandson, now 8 years old, loves the place. But we do also. The displays are excellent and if you sign up for a special treat (for a fee) you can get close to the little penguins who are adorable! It's a wonderful and very educational attraction and well worth the trip. Be sure to mention your AAA for a discount!",Harriette E
40,Creatures of the Sea,"The aquarium is good size with a varity of species to view. Great for young and curious nature lovers. Easy to find, lots of parking nearby. Entrance fee is reasonable and discounts can be found too. I enjoyed the time spent there. The cafe has good food reasonably priced along with merchandise to purchase. Personel on hand for questions you might have. Although I found the noise level intense at times, the displays are well layed out too.",nsfalk
50,good for everyone,"this is a place not only for families, but for everyone interested in a good experience. It is educational and beautiful, although it can get very crowded. try Shark Lagoon Night for less crowds and an outdoor experience on certain Friday nights.",LadyGExplorah
50,Long Beach Aquarium,this was a family trip...myself; my husband and 22 year old grandson...it's a lot larger on the inside than it looks; a lot of walking; very interesting exhibits...don't miss the penguin or seal shows...we also saw a movie on penguins and noticed that there was an outdoor section that children and adults were doing arts and crafts....there's a lot to see and do at the aquarium...you should allow at least 4 hours and wear comfortable clothing and shoes and carry water,eleanor v
50,Amazing Animals,This was our first visit to an aquarium of this sort and the experience was amazing. I loved the way we didn't have to wait too long in queue to get our tickets from the kiosk though it was a hassle to get a suitable place to park the vehicle. The aquarium is really big with the exhibits segregated into sections.,debjyoti d
40,Good 1/2 Day Outing,"First you must prepare for lots of kids no matter when you go. When you pay and go to have your parking ticket validated the woman was nice enough to tell us that the children from the schools just arrived ( 10:30am) and we might be wise to start on the 2nd floor and work our way down. Good advice however I was on a mission to get to the Lorikeet Forest exhibit and feed them. There was a class of 40 students and chaperones but I had the advantage because I bought an ounce ( $4) of nectar to feed them so I was guaranteed to have some land on us which they did. There is plenty of shows throughout the day, we saw the Seal & Sea lion one and was very informative as well as the one where 2 divers go into a giant tank filled with numerous types of fish and talks to you while they are in the tank. The open exhibits as far as the penguins are always good but I wish was more at eye level rather than looking thru a glass wall. The petting of the nurse sharks and rays and the hands on of start fish are always good for the little ones. Lots of exhibits for everyone but keep in mind, it will be noisy with kids running and screaming so just be patient and enjoy the day.",Charlie V
50,Second Best Aquarium!,"Let's not kid ourselves; Monterey is #1, but with the new Sea Lion exhibit now re-done and the new plans underway, it's becoming a close second!",cbucka
40,Right near the Pine Avenue Pier,"Great layout, Nice place to visit and learn about the sea life around the Loing Beach Harbor and California waters. Even with a lot of children there on the day I visiited, I was bale to navigate the venue easily and enjoy it.",T8423XSbrendal
30,Find a coupon!,The aquarium is nice but not worth almost $30. There seem to be more food options than anything else. Touching the stingrays was fun but that's about the only interactive activities offered. It won't take you long to get through it.,68066
50,Beautiful exhibits,"Two of us mature ladies visited the Aquarium of the Pacific on a Tuesday morning. Though we have lived in So.Cal for many years, neither of us had been here before. The drive from south Orange County was smooth in the carpool lane and directions from the 710 were excellent, though the truck traffic to and from the port is horrendous.Parking was perfect and after a few steps we were in the Great Hall of the Pacific, with the Blue Cavern kelp forest exhibit at the far end stretching high above us as two divers explained the various occupants (the Sea Bass are amazing).There is much to see here, all within an easy walking distance. The underwater exhibits are beautifully designed, including many varieties of ""Jellies"" that are fascinating to watch. The lorikeet forest was delightful. The little birds are entertaining with their antics, free flying in the large enclosure. Penguins were out and about in their habitat, and so many more creatures to see and admire.A tip for visitors: school children arrive in droves in the morning (we fled from one exhibit when 100 first graders descended upon it), but we were told that they all leave by 2pm. Even so, there was plenty of room to wander about or enjoy a cup of coffee and a pastry at the small cafe.Discounted tickets can be purchased in advanced at AAA locations. Our senior tickets were a real bargain.",CaliforniaBrit
50,Evening event,"We stopped by to check out an evening event on April 25th. Admission was free, fun local band played and kids enjoyed the outdoor facilities.",c g
40,Need to go when not crowded,"Decided to see this aquarium on a recent trip as it is highly rated. I must say, that I did enjoy the layout and the educational shows, but it is best seen on a day when there are not so many children. Don't get me wrong, I encourage families to explore venues such as this, but on this particular day, it was overwhelming. The exhibits are clean and well stocked with plenty of wildlife. Shows educational and entertaining. Needs a little more light at the front of the exhibits so that you can read the placards explaining the animals in the exhibits.",Tedd B
50,Perfect half day trip for everyone,"While the parking was a little hard to get to since we went right after the Grand Prix and roads were still closed, we were glad we made this trip. Lots of great displays. You can move through at your own pace. Spending a few hours here was perfect. There are several shows that smaller kids would probably enjoy. The big fish tank, the seahorse displays, and the touch tanks were my favorites. The gift shop was also wonderful with lots of nice gifts and souvenirs. The one improvement that could be made would be better food I t he restaurants. Overall, a very nice aquarium.",Heather J
40,Aquarium in the big sense,Nice place to visit if you like sea creatures. Bit expensive but some sights made it worth (I've seen my fav: a real life leafy sea dragon),Christophe L
50,Great Day,Took the afternoon to take our 7 month old her and we all had a great day here. Lots of options for food in the area.,MCCampos765
50,Viewing,Reviewed for large reception but was too pricey. Nice exhibits for families and easily walkable from hotel.,James L
50,Great Exhibits!,The exhibits are very informative and well-presented. The variety of sea life is good and their special exhibitions are always top-notch.,Gary G
50,Wonderfull place for families and kids or teens,"Wonderfull place for families and kids or teens. Not too hard because it's tiny but a lot of types of fishes, seabirds, and penguins",midur007
50,Aquarium of the pacific,"Nicely done! We paid extra for a behind the scenes tour. Well worth the few extra $. Our guide was Allison. She was very energetic, knowledgeable, and personable. We learned how the fish and other sea creatures were cared for. This tour really enriched our aquarium experience.",DCMRDH1979
50,Don't pass it up.,I walked through this by myself and it took me a good 2 hours because I looked at everything. But before that I took the private tour ($10) and it made it all more interesting for sure. Don't miss the outside spaces...more things to see!,Marie L
50,Visting the fishes,"Spent all day there . took a private tour of the otters . well worth the extra money . We were too late for the other Private Tours Private. All private Tours are a must!! Wonderful place where they preserve and protect. they rescue injured animals, fish otters, seals, ocean birds.. they administer to the sick & injured, then prepare them to be put back into the ocean. wonderful rescue and release program I could have spent another day there",SyvieGi
40,Great aquarium for families with young kids!,"I have been an annual pass holder for the Aquarium of the Pacific for several years, and I never get tired of visiting with my family.A large parking structure with plenty of parking spaces is located across the street. The elevators in the structure are very slow, so consider taking the stairs if you don't want to wait.Once inside, the layout of the Aquarium is thoughtful and easy to navigate. Each section has an entrance and exit that leads to the next area. As long as you keep on track, you should be able to see everything they have to offer.The staff members are attentive and helpful whenever you are in need of assistance. They also have several educational presentations.The Aquarium offers several opportunities to touch the animals with two touch tanks inside the facility (one for jellyfish and the other for tide pools animals like starfish and anemones). Outside, you can touch stingrays, horseshoe crabs and even sharks!!! Feeding the Lorikeets is a fun activity that is worth trying at least once.There is also a great play area for the kids. They can get wet here, so watch out!!!My 4-year-old son has been coming to the Aquarium regularly over the last 3 years, and it seems like he enjoys going just as much today, as he did on his first visit.Note, you may find yourself surrounded by a bunch of kids if you happen to visit at the same time as a school field trip.Definitely give this place a try if you are in the area!",Burculian
50,Charter member and keep on going,This is a world class aquarium and is not to be missed in Long Beach. We have been members since it opened and every time we go we see something new and different. It is a fabulous aquarium!!,Carol H
40,Fun day,A very diverse selection of marine animals. I scuba dive at topical locations and thought the habitats look very natural. I loved the aquarium with the many clown fish. Save the endangered species exhibit for last.,Patrick H
50,Great place for kids to visit,"The Aquarium is a wonderful place to bring children! Several underwater views of the aquariums allow children to see the seals and sea lions, sea jellies, eels, varieties of fish. At the Shark Lagoon, visitors are allowed to touch (only with two fingers) the bamboo sharks and manta rays. A play area lets the children run off excess energy. The Lorikeet Forest is filled with 100 lorikeet birds! Be sure to buy a small cup of nectar BEFORE entering the Forest... you will be rewarded with a lorikeet bird to two, landing on your arm, drinking the nectar!!",Lena K
40,Nice place to spend a few hours,"We went on a Sunday hoping it would be less crowded; no such luck. It was VERY crowded. Adorable/playful otters; octopus was out & about, so that was awesome; and there was a baby wolf eel (unusual & so cute); make sure to see the ray w/a 6' 7"" wingspan.",Kimmey C
40,Nice small auarium in Seaport Village in Long Beach,"this is a very small aquarium and a lot of hands on exhibits for young children. they can touch the sharks, view sea otters, sea lions, an aviary but no whales or dolphins.",Joyce N
50,First visit-Pleasantly Surprised,"This was our first visit and we had a great time. Earth day weekend, so it was a bit busy, glad we got there at 9. The exhibits are nicely laid out and fish look very healthy. Lots for kids to do outside with opportunities for touching rays and sharks. We got to watch divers feeding fish in the large tank-very cool.",ElkGroveChris
40,Fun Getaway,"Went to the Queen Mary for a brunch and drinks. Although, I have been there many times the views over the ocean never gets old.",Earl6
40,Nice Aquarium,"Very nice place, go before school field trip buses show up or wait till they leave in the afternoon. Parking is a bit pricey across the street.",TMas777_10
50,Become a member!!,"A welcoming aquarium with a surprisingly big variety of attractions. You will see each of the Pacific Ocean's different marine zones and the accompanying flora/fauna. Also they have lorikeets and touch tanks for the kids.Really great for kids 3 - 15 since there are so many activities and events for kids to take part in, and when in doubt the otters and the seals are a lot of fun to watch!!Also, membership (free entrance for a year and free passes, among other perks) is about the same cost as going 1x during the year, so it's a great value!!",charlieinspain
40,Educational and beautiful waterlife displays,"I only had one hour at the aquarium so I didn't get to spend enough time checking it all out BUT I did the best I could with what I had! This is a 3-level building and there are many indoor and outdoor things to see and learn about. Outside, there are the sharks and you can touch certain ones too. The penguins are outside as well as the sea lions. I got there too late to see any shows but I am sure they are good! Inside, it was nice and cool with AC and there are many places to investigate. The information printed on the walls, etc. is very informative. I liked being able to touch the starfish and sea urchins! The people working here seemed to really enjoy their jobs and have respect for the water life. Be sure to find out ahead of time when the shows are and plan accordingly. Also, at this time, many displays were under construction, so check on that too if you can. This was about a 45 min. and $26 Uber ride each way from downtown L.A. This is right there on the harbor, in the thick of things including near the Pike, a hub of stores and restaurants. Plan to make it a day or two in this harbor area and you will not be disappointed.",Heidi g
50,great aquarium,I am a aquarist and i though was a really nice exhibit compared to ny and may others.. do a good job of keeping corals.,Rene M
40,"Big, but avoid field trip day!!","Came for a behind the scenes tour. It was neat because I'm in the field; I like discussing water filtration, animal care, food prep, etc. Not sure an average guest would feel the tour was a must do. We were there on field trip day, it was nearly unbearable despite the fact that I'm also an educator and love kids. Validating parking was confusing. All things aside, the exhibits were super cool. I particularly loved the puffins, otters (and their training session!!), and all the jellyfish species!! They had neat ray and turtle species as well. Getting to see the ray feed was something else! The penguins had a cute outdoor exhibit and there were several touch pools.",Brattybritt92
20,Eh,I think they should limit the amount of visitors. Was so packed that we were uncomfortable and was difficult to get around. My daughter wanted to leave.,Adrienne Lewis
50,Very fun for kids!,Me and my husband took our kids and they had an amazing time. Many different exhibits and best part they get to touch the jellyfish and rays! Membership is a must you basically pay that one time visit and get to go for the rest of the year!,LucyAleman
30,Parking is $8 w/validation - Everything else was just okay.,"I've been to too many aquariums and they are all a bit different. This one doesn't really have anything, in my opinion, that makes it stand out from the average ""local"" city aquarium. We have one in Seattle and it brings that feeling of ""if you've seen one, you've seen them all"". Again, nothing special, although price is too high for what you get. Not too many exhibits. Just 1.5 floors really.",avidtraveler
40,Awesome fun and interesting for adults and kids,I brought my grandson here for a Grammies special day . Boy did we have fun . It's interesting and informative. We loved the seahorses and jellyfish the best . Also petting the stingrays was cool too . It's a bit pricey but well worth it . We had a quick lunch there in the cafe that was decent too .,Violeta A
40,Great Place to Spend a Spring Afternoon,"This is a fun place to spend a few hours , especially when the weather is getting warmer. The aquarium is nearby the convention center, Shoreline Village, and across the bay from the Queen Mary. There is parking in the parking structure across the street. A great place to take the kids to explore and see all the mammal and sea creatures. Fun for adults too. We especially enjoyed the shark lagoon and penguin habitat. Great experience for all ages and don't miss the great gift and book shop.",MandC0218
30,A nice place to visit,"I took the Metro blue line from LA to Long Beach, I was interested in seeing the area. The train dropped me off right downtown and I walked to the aquarium. It was nice but I had been to the Atlanta Aquarium and this one was downright small in comparison; but if you have not been before this is a good one to visit. The place was filled with school kids and the weather was perfect.If you have a chance visit you will have an entertaining 2-3 hour visit.",NNWSLARRY
40,Pricey but nice,The outdoor areas were the best. It was lovely but VERY crowded on an April Saturday. With parking it was over $100 for our family to go and that's pretty pricey for something you can do in 1.5 hours.,AlanaN1111
50,Wonderful Day!,Although crowded the exhibits are great and informative. People are in a good mood and everyone seems to cooperate and enjoy. Would go again in a heartbeat.,Linda M
40,Very cool place to take the kids,This aquarium was a very good learning Expierance for the kids. They have a lot of open pools where you can go and touch the little sea creatures. My kids loved the Bat Rays. The place is a bit pricy for a large family but well worth it.,gabreezymonster
50,With my sister,"Any aquarium is fun, seeing what's beneath the waves!! The sea horses and jellies, my favorites, are just lovely!!",BarbaraJHB
40,A Fun Place for the Family!,"The Aquarium of the Pacific is a fun, educational place to visit in Long Beach. I think it's best for kids 5 and up who can attend to information as they learn...little kids can enjoy the run-around, but won't really remember much...but hey - it's always nice to BEGIN an education with great visuals.The staff are excellent and are willing to answer extensive questions, so that's a very nice aspect! We also like the gift shop - many of the items sold there help peoples from other cultures who need to sell their goods to subsist.Lots to see...I always wish it were even bigger!",Alisa G
40,Always Love going to the Aquarium!,"They have so much to look at,includimg on the top area a place to touch all sorts of sea urchins and see cute acts by the sea lions..If you are in Long Beach,you definitely will be bummed if you dont take time to go..Its a lot of fun and so much to see..I totally recommend as a must see and do..Great for all ages!",apclegg
50,Great fun for Toddler,"Gave a year pass to my daughter and her family. We took my grandson for numerous visits (he was 2 at the time) and he loved it. The hands on exhibits are his favorites. Jelly fish fun to look at. All of the activities outside; boat to play on and steer, water to shoot, things to climb on, along with sea creatures to touch and feel made for a fun day.",Tammy C
40,An Aquarium Adventure Not To Be Missed,"The Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach California is truly one attraction you do not want to miss no matter what your age or physical abilities. It is especially fascinating for children of all ages. There are sharks and skates which you allowed to touch and even pet. There are seal (sea lion) shows. There are playful sea otters and there are fascinating water critter exhibits of all types.There are also colorful and wonderful lorikeets to feed and let walk on your arm or sit on your shoulder or finger.There are a number of film screenings that are very interesting and quite informative in a less than pedantic format.The cafeteria serves a variety of foods that are better than usually available at similar venues.All in all, a visit is well worth the time you wish to devote whether it be a couple o hours or an entire day. And if time permits and it is the right season, there are whale watching cruises available just outside the main entrance.",Michael D
50,Aquarium,I have been going to this aquarium for years. I really like it. I love the sea horse exhibit and jelly fish areas.,Margie C
30,"""AVERAGE""",We went to this aquarium because a friend suggested. It was ok but it was not what we expected. Monterey Bay Aquarium is much better.,GUCCI415
50,Excellent aquarium,Only had an 1.5 hrs here but it was worth it.lots to see and do.Staff very friendly and knowledge.Would definitely go back when we had more time,Pyrie3
30,Ok visit,We visited one afternoon and stayed around 3 hours. Car park is just across the street. Lovely area to walk round the water and to the lighthouse outside. Aquarium itself was ok. Quite a lot of small exhibits go look at.,JC00000
50,Sea Aquarium with grandkids,We had a really good time at the aquarium. My grandkids ages 5 and 6 we thrilled to see the sharks and other fish that were in tanks. They also enjoyed being able to touch stingrays and other fish. Talking to the scuba divers was especially fun for my granddaughter.,JohnEReed1972
50,Great place,"Yes it's not the biggest in the US, but we thoroughly enjoyed our time here. We went with children aged 9 and 11 and we booked a joint aquarium/ whale watching ticket.We had allowed 3 hours for the aquarium, which was just enough time to go round and see everything on show. We actually wished that we had allowed more time so that we could also listen to some of the talks - some of which were done from divers inside the tanks, and do some of the interactive displays. The map booklet contained some information on the creatures on show and had some press stamps to collect, which the children really enjoyed.Highlights were the 'horses and dragons' section and the opportunities to touch some of the rays, starfish, anemones and sharks (small ones!!)",Munchkin208
30,"Just Okay, but educational","We are big aquarium fans, and we've been to some beautiful facilities that really made this one look kind of amateur. The docents were mostly very good and the presentations were educational. The Otter's are always a favorite, and the touch-pools were worth a visit for sure. Two hours with twin 10 year olds and a 15 year old was about right for this aquarium.",bromcd
50,Outstanding,"I really thought this aquarium was great!! Lots of educational things for kids and adults to do. They also had a lot of hands on things for kids. We were there during the international children's festival, celebrating kids talents. All guests can partake in dances, music, crafts and demonstrations from all different cultures. It was very interesting.Their tanks and displays of local fish, jelly fish, sea horses and other marine life were very well kept and done nicely.It was not too crowded when we got there which made walking around quite nice.I'm sure they do a lot to educate people about taking better care of our oceans and helping with the sea life if they are sick or needing help.I really LOVED the aquarium and look forward to going back.",maryaling
50,Excellent visit at the aquarium,"I've been to many aquariums and the hands on with anemones, sea star and ursin was a nice discovery! You cN also touch the sting rays and little sharks. There was also lots of different jelly fish which was very interesting. Lots of good informstion and winderful staff to answer all the questions. There was a good deal package offered at the aquarium which included the whale watching (49$). I would recommend to take time to do this visit and learn about the ocean and all its living.",guyjosee77
50,GREAT Aquarium!,"One of the best interactive aquariums that I have visited. Would highly recommend for families, as well as adults",LMBTraveler
40,"Fantastic displays, but huge weekend crowds","I first visited the Aquarium on a quiet weekday, in-laws in tow, and was amazed at the quality, diversity, and accessibility of sea life at this location. Not only were there hands-on displays for the children, but the staff were knowledgeable as well, and the different areas were well labeled, laid out, and beautifully maintained. There are indoor and outdoor exhibit areas, and kids can do a scavenger hunt through the facility, gaining passport stamps as they go.My second visit was on a Saturday afternoon - what a difference. It was extremely crowded, with crying toddlers vying for attention from stressed out parents pushing hundreds of strollers. Navigating through the displays was difficult, as there was not a traffic directional ""flow"" through them. I found a brief break from the chaos by viewing one of the scheduled free informational short films on marine life (very well done and educational).Off to the gift shop - also an exercise in controlled chaos. The staff was charming and helpful, but the crowds were dense, and browsing the wares was difficult. I did note that a shop staffer was cruising the aisles, re-stocking and picking up displaced items constantly, all with a cheerful attitude. Items available were varied, and priced reasonably well. Water bottles, stuffed animals, handbags, t-shirts, jewelry, and nick-nacks with themes from otters to octopus to hammerheads were plentiful.Please don't miss this if you are in Long Beach - it's rated as the #1 attraction in Long Beach for a reason - but make the trip the best it can be by visiting on a weekday. Enjoy!",Gretchen M
30,What else are you going to do in Long Beach?,"Size and array of animals in this aquarium are pretty average. Lots of varieties of seahorses and jellyfish, so if that's your thing, check this aquarium out. Make sure you check for the ever present $8 off coupon in any of the tourist guides/magazines as a ticket price of $22 makes this a much better deal than the outright price of $30.",Angela O
40,A very educational attraction with several hands on exhibits.,"I've been to several aquariums and this one, in my opinion, is up there when is comes to offering guests views of life under the sea. There are several hands on exhibits where you can touch and ""pet"" sealife, such as rays and sharks, and that's pretty neat, especially for younger guests.",Troutinator
50,Awesome CA coast centered Aquarium,"Way above average! Great for kids with lots of touch opportunities.Well laid out. Allow at least 2 hours to see all tanks. Could spend more time if want to see special shows, ie feedings, divers, shows...Kinda pricey at normal entry of $29.00 for adults. Look for coupons and discounts online. We got in for $15.00 each with afternoon entry coupon.If u like sealife, and are in LA, this is a great stop!",BradandSuz
40,The feeling of being under the sea,As much as this place is nostalgic it is informational and entertaining. I love the variety of sea life as well as the rescue effort and awareness spreading about our current oceans situations. I look forward to enjoying this place for many years to come.,Stu G
40,Enchanting!,"Beautiful and informative. Beautiful colors and fascinating animals, out of the ordinary! A little pricey but one leaves there with a mind full of beauty.",Chris D
50,Excellent Aquarium! A must see in Long Beach!,Wow. What an excellent aquarium. The exhibits are wonderful. We had a great time here and would definitely go back again. It is great for kids and adults. They also have a Lorikeet Sanctuary where you can buy nectar and feed them. That was lots of fun too. We loved how the aquarium truly represented the nearby Pacific marine life.,Britt T
50,Awesome,"Busy place, but easy to get into and to navigate once you are inside. There are interactive displays and people to describe the different sea animals. beautifully kept aquariums and tanks.",Cheri
50,IMPROMPTU BIRTHDAY TRIP,"In town on business with my wife and it's my birthday but we're in Long Beach so I've always wanted to visit the LB Aquarium. So, off we go to a really neat afternoon. Well done aquarium with so much more than just fish! Thanks for the great time!",Jonathan R
30,Lots of coastal salt water aquarium tanks and some awesome jellies...but was a little disappointed,"It cost $30 to get in if you don't have any type of discount coupon. There were a few interactive educational things for kids... There were very little larger mammals such as sharks, no whales.... There were a few penguins, otters and rays...... but if it hadn't have been for the really cool........jellies..... it would have been a bust.... at least for me. Definitely not worth $30 for me anyway.....",2babybluz
40,Well worth a trip,"Is this a great aquarium? No, but it's a very good one and it's a great place to bring kids. They do a good job with the displays and the staff is very friendly.",Pat B
30,Good aquarium for the area,"Some excellent displays. Nothing like the Monterey Aquarium, but it is nice if you can't get to Monterey. The outside displays weren't that great, but the inside displays were excellent. It was great watching the divers interact with the fish.",DavidLowe0228
50,Cool business dinner!,We were treated to a private event on a second story balcony of the aquarium. The staff brought in a young penguin for an up close and personal visit. What a unique experience! The jellyfish display was mesmerizing....,RTKDMD
50,Beautiful roof deck party,We attended an cocktail and dinner party at the Aquarium and the view was lovely. We also roamed around a little and they have some beautiful exhibits. Walk is not far from thw convention center.,CKM1991
30,First time,"Interesting place. It's excellent for kids, because you can touch stingrays, sharks, starfish, crabs, etc. I loved the medical facility and wish we had been there when an animal procedure was scheduled.The staff in the bird aviary need to relax. There was constant shouting in a microphone about what not to do with the birds. We left quickly because the staff person was so annoying.Other than that, we enjoyed the variety of species and the jellyfish were amazing.",lno1976
20,Over hyped,"I specifically asked to go to the Aquarium of the Pacific on my one day in Long Beach because I saw a BBC special about it. Apparently there's an outdoor part where you can watch the whales go by. I never saw that. The place is not that impressive. My brother in law kept saying that it's nothing like the aquarium at Monterey Bay. He kept describing what they have at Monterey Bay. I wish I chose something else to see on my one day in Long Beach. Also, if you're an adult without children, NEVER go on a weekend. You can't get near the tanks because of all of the kids, their parents and strollers.",upstny
50,Lots of great hands-on experiences,"This isn't my first aquarium rodeo. Since my son is marine obsessed, we've easily been to over 25 aquariums around the world. This wouldn't be my favorite aquarium, but it would rank very high on the list. It's hard for us to see new things or have new aquarium experiences, but Aquarium of the Pacific did both for us.The jellyfish touch tank was a new and amazing experience. We loved being able to touch them and learn more about them from the very knowledgeable volunteer that worked there. The touch tank with the bamboo sharks was also a new and exciting experience and we enjoyed watching them get fed. Feeding the Lorakeets never gets old and we enjoyed AOTPs aviary greatly. The horseshoe crab exhibit with crab's blue blood vial was fascinating (even though we have horseshoe crabs in Florida). The staff and volunteers were all so nice and friendly.We got a great deal on a combo ticket with the Natural History museum, which turned out to be a very interesting and beautiful museum filled with amazing dinosaur fossils. It was a boy's dream museum!",MAG
40,Feed the Birds!,"I am pretty liberal with my aquarium reviews. My husband and I have gone to many aquariums that others rate very low and we have loved them.The Aquarium of the Pacific is no different. It is a very interactive, entertaining experience that I would strongly recommend to anyone who enjoys aquariums, animals, education, or has children. There is a penguin exhibit, several different types of jellyfish, including teeny tiny ones, there are otters, seals and sea lions, octopi, giant fish, and everything you would expect from an aquarium. In addition to those there is a touch pool for starfish and sea anemones, sharks, jelly fish, sting rays, and horseshoe crabs.Feeding the lorikeets is an exceptional experience. It is an additional $4, but it is definitely worth it. You get a small cup (a little bigger than the little paper things you get for ketchup at fast food restaurants) filled with nectar and you enter the bird area. If you offer it to one it will eat from the cup in your hand. My sister had one stand on her hand to drink, I had one land on my shoulder and then perch on top of my head. It was one of my favorite things we did there and we all agreed it was worth the extra charge.I would recommend going early, when it opens. You don't need all day there but it seemed much less busy early. It got pretty busy by the time we left around 2.The only reason I rated this as 4 circles instead of 5 is because I think their ""shows"" need work. They do an otter show, a seal/sea lion show, and a feeding in the largest tank. These shows usually consist of someone talking in front of the tank but you don't really see or understand what is going on. They feel very disorganized. I think they just need to improve these shows a little and it would be a perfect aquarium.",Stephanie M

50,Love the penguins and otters!,"We have a membership and have been members from the early days of the aquarium. Their exhibits are well designed and the docents are friendly and informative. It makes for a great, fun afternoon! There are restaurants walking distance, harbor cruises and shopping. It is a great area?",Speedcatbeth
50,Amazing displays of aquatic marine life,This place has a lot going on. Well worth a visit. Clean and beautiful with lots of large tanks. Experience a Vast array of marine life. Fun live interactions with animals. A great experience. Highly recommended,Lisa B
40,Nice Aquarium but DIFFERENT on New Year's Eve.,"This is a fun place to visit and to take the kids--young and old!However, if you're planning on visiting New Year's Eve, you should consider the pros and cons. The biggest pro is that you'll be able to watch the fireworks set off the Queen Mary without having to pay Queen Mary prices. The biggest con is that the Aquarium isn't that large of a venue so it's very crowded--being crowded is expected--but it's crowded with a LOT of younger people.So, if you're older than 40 and looking for a fun place to celebrate the New Year being rung in, this may not be the place for you.As an aside, I also spent the 4th of July at the Aquarium and this was a family oriented event.",Spa_Client
50,Finding Nemo and more,"Love, love, love the Aquarium of the Pacific. Stroll through the aquarium at your leisure and get a glimpse of the familiar and the unusual sea life. Great place to talk your children or the grand kids. Just watch as their eye light up at all they see. They also have a shark lagoon where you can see the sharks up close and even touch some of them. The Lorikeet forest is fun too!",Lori424
40,Weekend Adventure,Nice weekend activities to do the aquarium is located down in the harbor area with a lot of other activities around whale watching harbor tours there is a small amusement park there is old run dolls all kinds of restaurants but the aquarium it is very good attraction gives you a good idea of the kind of sea life that's in the Pacific well worth the wait in the line,darrellstravel
50,Excellent,"This was a lot better than we were expecting. There are alot of fish, jelly fish and they even have lorikeets outside. This is worth visiting.",John E
50,"Not as Well Known but Competes Well with the Big Boys in Chicago, Denver, Monterey and La Jolla","I love aquariums and where ever I go, I try to check out the aquariums. This aquarium has wonderfully designed exhibits. There is a wide array of sea creatures. Sea horses, sea dragons and basket stars were great. There is also an outdoors area with several touch ponds for kids with a variety of animals. Exhibits are informative and one could easily spend hours there. Admission is around $30 with validated parking for $8. About mid-price for top aquariums. Located in a tourist area that boast many chain eateries and specialty shops all within walking distance of the aquarium ( max 1 mile or so). You can even make a trip out to the lighthouse near by. The aquarium does have discounted admission for late afternoon/evening only so if you only have three hours or less, you may want to take advantage of those deals usually on the internet.",TomJ56
50,An amazing aquarium with amazing growth,"We have been going to the aquarium for the last 8 years. We take our kids at least once a month. It is large, well laid out, and plenty to do. My recommendation is to buy a membership and cut the line. As well, ask, ""what is new?"" Last week they had a ""pet the jellyfish"" exhibit. The movies are also great for taking a break, and letting everyone rest while watching an educational movie about nature and animals. The food is great on site and there is also a dozen restaurants within walking distance. Plan on spending the full day.",NickellFamilyTravel
50,Great time to be had,Well put together. Lots of great exhibits. Friendly staff. Easy parking. Restaurants within walking distance.,Frank O
40,Aquarium of the Pacific Long Beach CA,"We had a nice visit to the aquarium. We went Monday morning right when they opened. It does get very busy. Several school children visit on field trips. The exhibits are small and many people gather, making it hard to observe.",Hairup
50,Great place to visit - Hard to get to,"We tried apple maps to get us to the aquarium from the coast highway. After several wrong turns we finally found it. Once we did it was a great place to visit. One of the best aquariums I've been to. The exhibits were excellent with a wide variety of exhibits. All the fish exhibits were great but I got a big kick out of the Lorikeet exhibit these are very colorful Australian birds. You can feed the birds with nectar in a small cup you purchase outside the exhibit. As soon as you enter the birds fly to your shoulder or hand yo drink the nectar. It was fascinating to watch. But beware when you enter the exhibit. The birds perch above the doorway to get first dibs on the people entering with nectar. Unfortunately, the birds also freely relieve themselves from this perch and all who enter are in the direct line of fire. We were also going to visit the zoo this trip and they offer discounts for multi park visits which we took advantage of. There are too many good things to mention here but be sure not to miss this place.",jsachanda
50,A little gem!,"A great little aquarium with lots to offer! Lots of things for kids to do and see. Had the coolest jelly fish exhibits! Also saw sea lions, sea horses, rays, and sharks. Lots of fun!",Roxane W
20,Acquarium of the pacific,Highly overpriced and over rated acquarium. Only managed to keep the kids entertained for about 2 hours by which time they had seen all the exhibits they were interested in. The jellyfish and sea horse section was unique but the rest was disappointing.,Mubina G
50,"Sea creatures, critters, and more!","This is an excellent aquarium with numerous displays and interactive features for both children and adults. We spent at least two hours wandering from one display to another. While I didn't participate, the hands-on displays for touching certain animals was really cool.This is a great place for people of all ages. The windows of the tanks provide viewing for children and adults. I was surprised how many displays the aquarium has and we never were disappointed in what was to bee seen around every corner.The staff were very friendly and helpful and the gift shop was really nice and spot on with the great t-shirts and other gifts.We didn't take advantage of the cafe or restaurant but the facilities look great.Be sure to allow for at least two hours to take in all of the displays and features of this amazing and informative aquarium. I'll definitely suggest visiting Aquarium of the Pacific to family and friends when they're visiting the area!",Joe_Cool68510
50,We got to touch Jellies!!,"This place was awesome, and my kids had a blast!! Relatively inexpensive, and so much to do!! We got to touch Moon Jellyfish and Manarays!! Only bad part was that we had to park quite a ways away and walk to the aquarium. I cant wait to go again!",Erin M
50,Behind the scenes tour,"What a fantastic experience! Tickets for the behind the scenes are available to anyone, limited size group (8?), really informative, interactive, and just plain fun. Well worth the extra cost in my opinion. Truly memorable!",stredfield

50,Gorgeous aquarium,"This is a beautiful aquarium, well maintained with lovely exhibits. Gorgeous full-wall tank and tunnel tank. Nice array of fish and animals, including sea turtles! Kids love to get up close. Just wish it was a little less pricey. We were able to get discount tickets from Smart&Final at the time, which helped.",jjy2104
40,Awesome Aquarium!!,Such unique animals and sea life.......lioved it!! And so much cheaper if you go after 2 pm and we still had plenty of time to see everything!,Kookiedakop
50,Amazing! Love the Jellyfish,This aquarium is fantastic! The animals were amazing to watch. I would recommend to time your visit during the shark feeding. Sit by the windows below wear they feed for a great view. My favorite exhibit was the jellyfish! I never knew there were so many different varieties! The facilities themselves were very clean and parking was easy.,Kendra K
30,Long Beach Aquarium,"My visit was Saturday afternoon starting just before 3pm. I would highly recommend NOT going at that time. I had to wait in line to get my tickets, it took a while to find a parking spot. The place was just packed. The Aquarium did start to thin out a bit when I left around 4:30pm. The pricing seems a little on the high side(I paid $38.00 including parking).",psteelerfan77
40,Very nice visit,"Visited this aquarium for the first time. Enjoyed it even though it was a bit pricey. Very crowded on a Saturday, but we more or less expected a crowd. Would visit again when we're in the area.",Mitzi B
40,Beautiful and extremely full,If you not prepared this can be a horrible adventure....there is always an extreme amount of kids and they very noisy...so know this before you want to go on a weekend... its a great feast for the soul as you see creatures from all around the world and its great.... if you can see past the young ones finger prints on everything,Jason B
50,Loved this Aquarium!,"We visited from England, UK - I thought it was a little bit expensive as we didn't have any coupons.. however, it was a brilliant aquarium! The tropical tanks were huge, the sea horses were amazing and I saw things I'd never seen in other aquariums.Would highly recommend!",Becky H
40,Came back again!,"Came back again this year. Visit will take you 2-3 hours. We had coupons so adult tickets were only $15.00. All of the exhibits were still pretty cool. Got to see lots of sea animals. Lots of petting pools outside so the kids could pet the sting rays, sharks, etc. Very cool!",jt99941
40,Had fun,"Spent a couple hours here with the family. We really enjoyed it. Smaller than most aquariums I have been to, and didn't particularly care for the shark exhibit. I thought that was lacking as the sharks are usually the number one draw. Overall, we had a good experience and I would recommend this to anyone looking to kill a few hours.",Nick W
40,The place to be on a rainy day!,"Honestly the only reason we went to the aquarium was because it was raining and couldn't stand to be in the hotel any longer. It was amazing, I saw sea creatures that I did not know even existed. The sea dragons - mind blown. The admission price was good, the overall experience was wonderful. If you are in the area, you should check it out.",Kara C
50,Sea horses and baby jellies,A really fun time. Such a fascinating variety of sea creatures. Great displays and even a movie. We learned so much.,jazzindey
30,Not A Bad Way To Spend The Day,Not a bad place to visit but I felt it was too expensive for what it was. We got round it pretty quickly. I would still recommend it but just don't expect it to last the day.,Conor B

50,Favorite Aquarium in Southern California,"Been going to the Aquarium for years and it continues to be one of my favorite places in Long Beach. If you get the chance, definitely got to make it to a Night Dive and enjoy the adult version of the Aquarium with adult beverages and live music!Also, if you're curious about local habitats and sea life, there's no better place to visit!",Scot B
40,A great family experience,"We absolutely loved the Aquarium. There is literally something there for everyone, from the biggest to the smallest. It is entertaining and educational. The only disappointment was the penguin exhibit. It was quite small and there was no interaction of human and animals. My suggestion would be to expand it and try having trainers feeding and describing the birds. The Audubon Aquarium in New Orleans exhibit is an excellent example of this and really presents the lovely and quirky personalities of these wonderful creatures.",Chris S
40,Very nice aquarium,Visited following a cruise and were even given a $10 per person voucher making admission $19.95 per person. Lots of great exhibits of sea life. Very well presented. Many opportunities to see live interaction with the animals and fish. Lots of things for little folks with activities geared towards them. Sea lions were a hoot and otters were clowns. Neat interactive exhibit with Lorakeets. I would suggest visiting first thing in the am or late in the day. Nice gift shop too.,Pyrlover
40,Great Family Outing Venue,"Our family' first visit in Long Beach, and it was raining the whole week we were there. We decided to explore things indoors other than shopping, we came across the Aquarium of the Pacific. They had the horses and dinosaurs exhibit when we were there, and we saw a lot of species/collection we haven't seen before from other international aquariums. We definitely highly recommend for anyone to explore the Aquarium of the Pacific.",BcMom02
30,Lovely visit,"We visited the Aquarium early in the morning. There were plenty of school buses, so lots of children; but there was still plenty of space to wander and view. The special exhibition was about sea horses, and it was wonderful in both the species exhibited and the information provided. It was not as big as you would expect, but it a lovely way to spend a couple of hours. The only drawback was that I thought it was quite pricey, but there are vouchers available, but remember to check the time they are valid from.",genyf0ster
50,Great day to get out of the rain,"This is the perfect place to spend the day. The Aquarium offers a little bit of everything, for everyone.",Rmclb20
40,Great Visit and staff was very helpfull.,"We had a great time and it was a wonderful experience. Love all the sea horses and the fact that you could pet sting rays. We have had the experience of going to a lot of other aquariums that are much bigger and impressive, but for what it had, it was very nicely done. Recommend if you are in the area! Did not experience the dining.",JlharTen
50,So much animal contact,"An excellent aquarium! Most of the tanks are saltwater. They have more animals that you can have contact with than any aquarium that I have seen, including jellyfish, horseshoe crabs, stingrays, sharks, rainbow lorikeets, sea stars, sea anemones and sea urchins.",4stevemandy
50,Day with my Granddaughter,"I've taken my granddaughter here several times (she's 3) and we always have a great time. She loves to feed the lorikeets, touch the rays, and look at all the amazing exhibits. It's very simple to navigate and you can take a stroller and park it inside.",pnwild562
50,Fun field trip,"Great views of sea life, the docents are impressive with their knowledge. The complex is beautiful. It gets noisy with the children but thats fine with me.",Gordon Collier
50,BEst place to entertain and educate children,"I love taking my young family members here, even two and five year olds are completely absorbed and engaged.",ARTsue68Bks
40,Less crowded during the week,"I love this aquarium in spite of the it being built too small from the beginning. It is laid out in an interesting way that takes you around the world. Lorakeets are a blast--you can buy nectar and they will land on you and drink it. Great interactive stations and places to touch shark and sting ray--great for kids, but my blind brother-in-law loved it too. Seal exhibit was closed, but will reopen after being refurbished. The seals are one of my favorite exhibits as you can see them swimming below the surface and above. Great family outing for a reasonable price with wonderful restaurants nearby for after.",Kathy D
40,Taking granddaughter to the aquarium,Small contended but a lot of information there for the yong children to see and do. Good educational tool,kamkam93
50,Great Place,My kids love this place. Educational and fun at the same time. For the price of admission you get an annual pass.,Joe B
40,Great fun,"We decided to pay this place a visit on Sunday. Highly recommend buying tickets online to avoid the lines. Much larger place than had expected. Thoroughly amused with all of the varieties of marine life that germane to the pacific. Being a scuba diver from Florida, greatly appreciate the opportunity to learn about the left coast. Beware of small kids on the weekends. All in all, had a great time.",W Keith B
40,Perfect Outing,The AP is a perfect outing for you and your smaller children. They will be mesmerized with all of the sights. Wear good shoes and be prepared to watch and wait as your kids stare and stare. This is a great attraction during the infrequent poor weather in Long Beach. :) Enjoy!,ProfAragon
50,Well done aquarium.,We are adults and completely enjoyed this place. It's also great for families. There were a lot of them there too. Easy to access and view. Many different kinds of exhibits. Sea otters and jelly fish were a favorite.,Pippi011
40,Unusual species to see,"We had a good time looking and learning at the different species of fish. It was very interesting. The sea horses were awesome, as well as the Lorikeets ( OMG, MY FAVORITE) they were so cute.I had no idea they would actually drink the nectar! I could have stayed there all day.We saw the seal show and it was pretty good. We spent about 4 hours there.",terriwe
40,A Dry Dip Into the Ocean,"It's much like a dive into the ocean without getting wet! Enjoy circling floating, gelatinous orbs of jelly-fish and dazing deep into the eyes of a seal, just before it playfully shoots past you. Yes, the aquarium offers a variety of wildlife and entertainment. Although, it does certainly disappoint with its shark exhibit. This area leaves you to gaze downward on confined enclosures of lethargic sharks that look as frightful as a cat on your grandmothers shoulder.",Thomas G
40,Worthwhile visit,"Pricey at $30 (look for discounts AAA, hotel coupons) but a nice way to spend an afternoon. I especially liked the jellyfish and giant octupus. All exhibits are large and clean with staff available to answer questions. Full schedule of various activities. Scuba Cafe had some pretty good but pricey food. Gigantic gift shop.Definitely worth a visit but do try to find coupons to make it more economical.",travelgalAvon
40,Fun and tons of pennies,"We love going to aquariums and zoos. Nice aquarium. I collect smashed pennies and there are 6 machines and penny books. Lots of interesting animals. Loved the jelly fish the most. Unfortunately due to the stroller brigade could not get up close to see a lot of the exhibits. I wish place would have an adult only time. However, this aquarium has a map booklet with information about the exhibits and how to get to each one and they have sections to get an embossed stamp. I love that and had fun getting the embossed stamps. I recommend checking out the aquarium.",Loretta A
50,Great attaction,"This was a wonderful aquarium. It was not too big, but it was enriching. Delightful 4D movie for the kiddos.",Amy G
20,First trip,Visited last month with my son. I was told this aquarium was awesome but I actually thought there would be more animals. Kind of disappointed. Cool place for young children though.,Rondog13
40,Lots of beautiful species,"Well presented, lots of beautiful species in huge aquariums. Explanations very clear and instructive.",Yves de Menten de Horne
50,Really nice aquarium,"Long Beach offers a few activities, but not that much so if staying in town, the Aquarium of the Pacific is one of those ""must-do"" especially for families with kids.What I liked: Lots of programs and ""shows"" throughout the day. Strong educational mission. Nice, modern venue with a few outdoor stations. Good opportunity for interacting with specific fish species. Awesome Lorikeet enclosure where you can feed them nectar. Easy to spend half a dayWhat to watch for: Although a fairly large venue, and separated by geographic areas, sea life species were fairly repetitive from one section to the next and there were few WOW factors, especially considering the price paidAll in, this is a recommended activity in Long Beach and a really nice aquarium. Just wished that it would be a tad more affordable",JF Bordeleau
40,Beautiful venue,"Enjoyed the outdoor exhibits. Clean, well maintained facility. Located in Rainbow Harbor, within walking distance to many wonderful attractions in Long Beach.",deMol101

50,Good aquarium,Great aquarium with a lot of fantastic displays and some huge tanks full of marine life. We spent a few hours wandering round and taking it all in. The otter display was a particular highlightSadly the seal enclosure was being refurbished while we were there.,FullFonz
50,School field trip,"If you are looking for something to do in a short time with the kids, this is the place.This small aquarium has variety of sea life to view from tank fish to seals and stingrays. Then once your are finished there you can walk along the water or in to town and have a nice lunch or do some shopping.",regina44duncan
40,Swimming with the fieshes,This a really nice attraction for the kids to go to. They love seeing the different types of ocean and fresh water fish. There are more ocean then fresh though. It is a great little habitat to show the kids about the ocean and how we must take care of it.I know the cost to me for a family is high. Worth it though if you can find discounts on online websites.They do validate parking as well but again check the rates going in.,Michael H
30,nice but limited,we visited on a day when there was monsoon rains. The facility had several leaks in roofs and a few exhibits closed.There are several wonderful exhibits. our favorite was the 3 story aquarium that was an entire wall filled with large specimens. There are dozens of smaller exhibits thru out the facility and a few larger sea lions and shark exhibits .All and all it was a 7 out of 10. For $30 a person it was not a value. If you compare this to the Seattle Aquarium- which is similar in scale - the Seattle Aquarium is significantly better.,Thorson H
50,Awesome!!🐧🐙🐡🐋,"I wanted to go there because the movie ""finding Doris"". I have read about it and people wrote good and bad view. We went and we thought it was a great idea. There are differents rooms with beaitiful amd colorful fish, jelly, sharks among others.You have to visit. Probably you can find another bigger aquariums, but you have to visit this one. It's ideal if you are with children, they really enjoy it. There are many latin people, but the place has all the information in English. Even though, you have fun. Children love touching sharks!!🐟.",Cote-Va-Chile
50,We loved it on a very rainy day!,"We were visiting the area when they had a huge rainstorm come through, and we were looking for something to do that was mostly indoors.We went on a Sunday, and the place was very busy, however we had our rain gear, so we went to the outdoor exhibits and nearly those exhibits to ourselves!There are shallow pools where you can actually touch the rays and some sharks- very cool! For sure this was one of the highlights of our vacation. Our kids made friends with a little ray, who kept coming back to say hello... it was adorable!We also loved the different jelly fish tanks- beautiful!It cost our family of four about $100 for entry, but for us it was worth it, and we were able to spend a couple of hours there.",Rachelle R

50,Moon Jelly touch tank was our favorite!,"There are so many wonderful exhibits at this aquarium it is hard to list everything. First off go after 1:30 weekday afternoons if you want to avoid the school groups. You will still have plenty of time to see/do all the exhibits. The Moon Jelly touch tank was one of our favorites, it is easy to miss. After feeding the Lorikeets ( well worth a few dollars) they are so colorful! You walk down the right side of the building feels like you are leaving, before the exit door that leads into the back entrance of the gift shop is the Moon Jelly touch tank.",Jennifer F
40,good place to visit and take little ones,this place is more fun for little ones. i believe its a bit pricey for how small it is. i've gone about 4 times and not much as changed. would hope some new additions could be made and possible interaction with animals. without having to pay more.,daisy d
50,Event Cocktail reception,"We attended The Special Events cocktail party. They had music, food, entertainment and best of all we were able to enjoy the aquarium. The exhibits were top notch. The variety was amazing. Truly a great experience to see many different types of marine life. I would go back and if lived in the area maybe get an annual pass if they offer such a thing.",RichardVegas
50,A fun way to discover the Pacific and its wildlife,Lots of really different presentations based around different aspects of the Pacific Ocean. Well explained with a very logical thread. Aquarium looks a little 'tired' in places and relatively expensive at nearly $30 entrance per person but well worth the fee. A good 2-3 hours is needed to do it justice and is an enjoyable overall experience.,SteveP1234
50,Beautiful aquarium,"We got there when they opened and spent a couple of hours roaming around. Very impressed with the activity areas all,over the aquarium for kids. We got to see how star fish eat when they were fed pieces of fish. Lots of sea horses and many varieties. Well worth going to see.",roytan1947
50,"Do the Whale Watch, but Dress Warmly","Booking the whale watch through the Aquarium is just a few more dollars that outside vendors. We spent about an hour before and after the boat tour in the Aquarium. My boys (8 and 10) loved the aquarium, especially the touch tanks outside. The store is huge! We were there the week after Christmas, and it was very crowded. The whale watch was an experience. Dress warmly! Take snacks (although there is a small snack bar on the boat). We saw a large pod of common dolphins and one grey whale. The captain and staff patiently searched and waited for a whale and spent plenty of time near the whale to give all of us a view. Everyone rushed for seats on the front of the boat when we boarded, but later everyone crowded inside as it gets chilly on the open water.",HappyFamily43082

50,Great experience for the whole family!,"My wife and I took our first child here when he was a little over 1 year old. He enjoyed all the attraction so much that when we had our second son, we decided to get a annual pass.

40,Time Killer - Good way to do it,"We had a 4 o'clock flight out of town - Information desk will hold your luggage, so that's handy. It was a Saturday morning so it was a bit busy. Clean place, the staff is very friendly. We did not eat but noticed a few snack stops. The best part is the inside upstairs tanks. The sea lion was closed for rebuilding. If you have kids there are many interactive & ""touch"" stations. If you just like to see cool fish, its a nice stop & good way to eat up some time. Easy place to catch an Uber & there are many restaurants within a short walk & a beautiful harbor just next to it.",Bree B

However, if you are looking for the best aquarium in the world, this isn't it.The aquarium is clean, but a little small in some areas. I'm a sea otter lover, so was pretty excited to see them there. The weather in Long Beach is always nice, so enjoying the outside exhibits is lovely.I'm happy we went and may eventually go again. Kids will love it...and you better like kids if you go there.",Amanda M
20,Wheelchair users beware!,If you use a wheelchair you will not be able to experience the touch tanks. They are not accessible. You can look from arar on some but not all can you even view the animals within. The childrens playground is off limits for disabled children as well.. This is a small aquarium but not easy to get around using mobility devices such as a cane which is what I was using during my visit. It is pricy so that may be a problem for anyone on a fixed income. The animals are fun to see and the tanks are clean which is a very nice.,princess5

50,A Wonderful Aquarium,"Living in the Midwest, we found the Aquarium of the Pacific very interesting. We learned so much about the marine life on the West Coast. In the the Horses and Dragons exhibit the leafy sea-dragon was definetly weird in a good way. Lots of kids, but they didn't bother these three adults. We did catch one show which was at the big tank with volunteer divers feeding the fish. The perfect destination for families.",Bernadette H
50,"Excellent aquarium with lots of touch/feel opportunities, shows, fish and birds","We spent 3 very enjoyable hours . The aquarium has so many interactive opportunities all day long.

50,Otter Encounter Amazing Experience,"This aquarium is an excellent place to take kids. There are lots of touch tanks and interactive programs beyond the norm. They also have an area to feed small lorikeet parrots. The highlight of our visit was a behind the scenes tour and interaction with two of their sea otters. You first learn about sea otters for 10 min in a classroom followed by an opportunity to feed the otters. The otters come right up to the plexiglass and you can feed them through a small hole in the glass. The marine biologist and aquarium ambassador were fantastic, knowledgeable and made this fun and educational--Jimmy and Joze. Highly recommend this experience. You need to book in advance for this experience as this is only done on limited dates and times. This experience made our already fun visit quite memorable.",Natsfandc
50,A good day out & we opted for whale watching too,"After a 2 bus, getting lost, getting bearings kind of trip we arrived at the Catalina ferry terminal, 5 minutes from the aquarium.The bus ride through Long Beach is great , reminding us of South Beach Miami .Queues were quiet when we bought our tickets and the staff were very helpful.The aquarium is very well stocked and there is lots to see, their collection of Jelly fish is brilliant. The big theme was Horses & Dragons, lots of sea horses and Sea Dragons-unusual and very interesting.We took the Midday boat & we saw Dolphins swimming plus a Grey whale. The boat had a Café on board and it was good to get a drink later in the voyage. It was a bit cold on the way back to the aquarium but the interior cabin was warm and welcoming .A good day out",Jim G
40,Well done Aquarium,A weekday visit had us in the middle of maybe kids day at the Aquarium. Very kid friendly place. There were employees everywhere answering questions and letting you touch some of the fish. They seem to be improving the place with some construction going on but did not affect our visit much.Our visit was an hour and a half but we didn't do any of the add on backstage activities. Food inside was mostly action park food but plenty of options outside. Parking is validated if you ask for the discount.,coopervanning
40,Good Attraction,"I was previously visit S.E.A Aquarium (Singapore) and had a high expectation on Aquarium of the Pacific. Unfortunately, the aquarium was not as huge as S.E.A Aquarium Singapore. The displays was good but hard to say that it was excellent. The good thing is that I got discount coupon from the Los Angeles Map. So, the admission was around $7 lower than regular price.",Dyah P
40,Aquarium & Harbor Cruise,"We spent a few hours at this Aquarium and it was great. It was a rainy day but they have plenty of exhibits indoors and everything is kept very clean and well maintained. The sea otters, jelly fish and penguins are definitely a few of the exhibits you want to check out. We did the Harbor Cruise as well and although it was a damp day, the tour guide was very informative, you learn a lot about the area and what the harbor is used for and the history. Highly recommend it!",casey_craig
50,Exhibits galore,"From schools of fish to penguins, this Aq has it all. The divers speak to you from the tank. Amazing!The penguins are super cute, jelly fish magical, & the outdoor exhibits are worth catching. Large gift shop ample--stop.We had guests that, after 3 hrs, returned to see more!Yes, it's that good!",Chocoholicjr
50,Under the Pacific Ocean,This unique aquarium starts with the sea life of the Mexian waters and journeys north all the way to the Alaskan waters. The displays are magical especially the sea horses.,3rdplanetravler
50,Great aquarium! nice location,"I love the size of this aquarium and it's surprising the fish they have here. It's much larger than Scripps in La Jolla and the fish are in clean, large environments.One year my organization used the Aquarium as a fund raiser location; we held a dinner here and raffled off a lot of nice prizes but the best part was being where we could go look at the fish throughout the night. It's a nice place and worth the money. If you are local an annual pass is also worthwhile.",bonitadc
50,What a wonderful morning!,Well worth a visit. We were so impressed with the exhibits. Well maintained and fun. The jelly fish and penguins are my favorites. Everyone was very informative. I'd go again!,DoggaMomma
50,Puts our hometown one to shame,"HOLY CRAP! This place is awesome, so much to see and do! Impressive displays and worth every cent! All the touch tanks set this place apart from most aquariums I've been to! Even for being totally packed we still saw everything we wanted to!",Lex M
30,In need of a fresh up and food service efficiency,"The aquarium is a nice treat for little kids. There was high expectations of the attraction from advertisements and reviews.Having been to other aquariums, this aquarium is quite similar to others around the country. Further, this place feels a bit dated and in need of renovation which detracted from the wow factor. One starts the tour with a large view of fish through glass with scheduled feeding times. The sound quality of divers talking and demonstrating the feeding of the fish was very poor. At times, it sounded like the scratching noise made on a chalk board. Many of the interactive stations are also found in other aquariums too.The one item that one needs to be prepared for is dining in the cafe. The process is not efficient. Service is very slow if one orders a hamburger. We spent about 1 hour waiting for the grilled food to come to the table after it was ordered. If you get a slice of pizza or a salad, you get served much faster.Parking was very convenient, across the street from the aquarium. The cation though is to come early as it fills up.Outside of the distractions, the kids were happy and ready to go after spending 3 hours.",R_n_R_Travellers
40,Nothing too Special,I came here on New Years Eve when I was visiting a friend in the area. I had been to a couple other aquariums and this one didn't really have anything that stood out to me. I still had a good time and the sea otters and penguins were my favorite part. Was a good way to spend a rainy day.,Kyle C
50,Great place for the kids,We did the Aquarium and the Queen Mary. The Aquarium is perfect and we would do it again. Skip the Queen Mary though.,James K
50,What an Amazing Place!,I have never seen such a wonderful variety of sea creatures! Don't miss the jellyfish and the water dragons. Great for all ages!,Krista E
50,Impressive display.,"We had been here a long time ago. We had the opportunity to come to a New Years Eve party and jumped at the opportunity. Although there were various bands and food stations, we spent our time looking at the displays. We were impressed with the variety of sea life with displays both inside and outside. This is a great place to spend a couple of hours and there are lots of restaurants close by for lunch or dinner.",Samndjsdad
40,Great Photographic Practice,My husband and I went there to keep our photographic skills up to date. The stingrays were very active and we were told by the volunteers that they were more active in the morning. The only unfortunate item was the seals and sea lions were off exhibit till 2017. My favorite exhibits were the sea jellies and lorikeets.,Pandamonium1362
50,Great Place to Take Kids,There are indoor and outdoor exhibits. The outdoor exhibits provide lots of opportunities for kids to touch the sea life.,AmericanTouristBen
50,Rainy Day Excursion,We were booked for Catalina but the weather would not cooperate. Lovely aquarium. Be careful the tiles at ticket booth area slick if raining. Fell on my butt! The seals were so entertaining. Penguins were a nice surprise. Great day for all ages.,Sharon S
40,Everyone loved it,"This is a great place to spend an afternoon with the grandkids. You can pet stingrays, look at Jelly fish, or go into the crazy bird sanctuary. This place is hours of entertainment!",Debbie M
50,Worth a visit,"I have visited a number of acquariums and I would rank this in the top five. It is also noteworthy that the cafe upstairs serves excellent food, not typical for this type of venue. Plan to have lunch here and you will not be disappointed.",WhisperedInsights
50,Nice surprise,"Having been to the Monterrey Aquarium several times I wasn't sure what to expect. Wow, really liked it. The seahorse exhibit and jellies were highlights. Lots and lots of kids and families. Our kids are all grown so it was just two adults, but that was ok....when it got loud, we went a different way. It wasn't that long ago we had the kids running around.",Teni725
30,Not as much as we expected for the size,We must be unlucky in that it was a rainy day so we chose a traditionally indoor activity and went to the aquarium only to find a lot of outside walking and we got drenched! Was actually a little disappointed with the aquarium as it's not really that accessible with a pushchair and the Starbucks didn't have any coffee! But our daughters face when a shark went past her made up for it. Not an all day activity but worth a visit if you have some spare time.,SpenceyL
50,Great for the Entire Family,Wonderful displays and interactive shows with the children and adults. There indoor and outdoor activities along with communication with staff divers and the audience.,Barry G
40,Interactive Aquarium,"Very interactive aquarium with plenty of exhibits to look at. They displayed a great variety of fish and some wonderful shows. However, it just seemed very much like every aquarium I've been to. Nothing really stood out. Been to a few aquariums throughout your lifetime? I suggest skipping this. Nothing special goes on here from any other.",ciarbucks
50,Great family trip,Appeals to all ages. Extra consideration to the local aquatic habitat. Lots of great restaurants nearby,Golfer26
50,There's something fishy going on here!,"We came to California for some sunshine but one rainy day we decided that the Aquarium of the Pacific might make for a good indoor activity. We were right. This is one of the best aquariums we have ever visited. The variety of sea life that can be found off the California coast is fascinating. We especially enjoyed the surrealistic look of the many kinds of jellyfish, the sharks, the sea horses, the antics of the diving birds, and the charming cuteness of the sea otters. Kids seem to really enjoy the place. There is also convenient parking across the street and a variety of restaurants within walking distance.",Granddad Green Go
50,Aquarium,The aquarium is a nice family or date outting. You can spend up to 2 hours there. I recommend experimenting this place.,CheWhy
40,"Great, busy","First time I've ever been here and it disappointed only a little in that it was much smaller than I imagined. It was also pretty crowded as it was on a Saturday around noon time. Lots of pushy people and their kids! The highlight, I have to say, was walking into the bird feeding area with the 4 dollar shot of nectar and the birds just come and crawl all over you.",Antonio Anderso... R
50,Such a fun hands on aquarium- loved it!,"A wonderful aquarium. I loved touching jelly fish, sharks and star fish. All the exhibits were fun and educational. Lots of different sea horses and sea otters and penguins and birds. My husband and I went without kids and we had a blast. Not just for kids.",Jola O
50,Good place for kids,This place has lot of interactions activities. This is the only place we're the have jelly fish touch pool. It's so nice to learn a lot about marine life.,Priya K
30,Visit with Grandson,"The aquarium offers a wide variety of pacific fish, with some breathtaking displays. It is not a big space. We were there for under 2 hours and saw everything that was included in the admission price. There are maps, but not many guides to tell you how to get around. The sea lion exhibit was closed, which we didn't find out until we were at the exhibit. That was disappointing. We did have discount coupons, but even with the discount we paid $90 for 4 adults. Our 2 year old grandson was free.",JJN96
40,Nice To Visit But A Little Pricey,"It's a fairly nice aquarium but for something called the ""Aquarium of the Pacific"" I guess I was expecting more. I think the place is geared more towards educating and entertaining children so adults might not find it that interesting overall. With an adult ticket priced at $29.95 it's also somewhat pricey.",superjerryw
40,Enjoyable,"Was a fun trip, but wasn't the best aquarium I have ever been to, Seems they could do better.But it's a good day trip for the family. Wouldn't be the number one thing I would plan for a couple.",Trsimmons1
40,"Otter bring disinfectant, rubber gloves, and a surgical mask","Nice place to observe exotic marine life. Sharks, and starfish, and sea-life, oh my!Otters were worth the price of admission.Just be aware, the place is packed with children, so your best bet to not get sick is to take a multi-vitamin before you go, wash your hands frequently, maybe even wear a surgical mask to cover both your nose and mouth.",bremic2016
50,An amazing collection of sea life.,"The Long Beach Aquarium is a great attraction for all ages; it is entertaining, educational and stimulating. There are lots of kids there having a great time, especially at the touch tanks. There is an amazing assortment of sea life from coral to sharks and an astonishing array of jelly fish. There is even a cafe and an Australian parrot exhibit!! I have only been there twice but will certainly go again and again.",danielml85
50,Proud Member,"After experiencing the aquarium with friends that came in from out of town, I immediately became a member. I live about 10 minute walk from there, and definitely see how this place has a wonderful impact on the kids and the community. Everyone there was lovely as well. The cafeteria could use more staff (long long wait) but you have to expect that with attractions...",ohcurlyone88
50,Awesome Time at the Aquarium!,This was the the highlight of the trip. Great exhibits! So fun watching the Sea Otters & Penguins with their Christmas treats! Great fun for everyone in the family!,amgrahek
50,A great day at the Aquarium of the Pacific,"My sister was coding from NJ and had never been to our aquarium. We do enjoyed seeing the amazing care that the sea creatures and animals in their facility get. Learned a lot. Since it is local for me, I bought an annual membership. So worth it!",Robin J
30,Small,This aquarium was one of the smallest that we have visited. With the name aquarium of the Pacific it was fun for the kids but not a lot of attractions. We toured the entirety in about 2 hours. It was a let down for the adults.,Kelly B
50,Really cool aquarium,Definitely worth visiting if you're in the area. Not a really big aquarium but has a lot of see. The areas are split up in a logical manner so you can see different fish near other species that they'd be around in the wild. Good for small kids but during the week be careful because many schools field trip to here and it can be hectic. The cafe is OK and not too badly priced for attraction food.,Brian V
30,Good,Wished it was bigger but saw lots of interesting things. Definitely a place to bring the kids. The divers were the coolest. They also have an area where you can touch certain creatures.,Jac F.
50,Sting Rays!,Got to touch sharks and sting rays. There was an otter that was playing with my husband. Seeing the shark eggs were cool. Also seeing the baby fish,Genavieve R
40,Definitely A Hit Among Kids and Aquatic Life Enthusiasts,"A very good place to visit in Long Beach with so many different species. I for one am not so fond of understanding different species but looking at these different variety of species is a Treat in Itself.Please keep at least 3 Hours for this. If with kids, probably a little more.",tejasghongadi
50,Interactive Aquarium Experience,"This aquarium was perfect for our family outing with our 4 and 6 year old girls. They have several different touch-tanks for hands-on exposure to some of the marine wildlife, plus hundreds of tanks in each of the areas. The girls loved the interactive guidebook that taught them about each area/focus of fish because it included a spot for them to stamp/emboss when the found the spotlight fish/animal from that section. It turned into a little game of marine hide-and-seek. They learned a lot and were totally engaged the whole time!",Meghan K
50,Perfect Learning Aquirium.,"This is a very friendly hands on aquarium. The volunteers here are very knowledgeable. And they demonstrate and teach you about the exhibits. Not just tell you the name of the animal. Not a big place but plenty of hands on exhibits with the chance for you to pet a sting ray, jelly fish and others sea life. My son loved the penguins and the stingrays. It is convient to get to. Parking directly across the street. I found it to be a good value for your money. The staff is very well trained and you can tell they love what they are doing.",drisaudi
40,Nice Exhibits,"Great place to learn about the ocean and fish, I had a great time with the exhibits. Many different animals and the best part if you get a little tired or hungry many good restaurants around with good drinks.",Marie B
50,Just once,Too many people for my taste. The space seems very tiny for all the attractions. But great for the kids!,Dar
40,Fun day,It was raining pretty heavily on Saturday and I was glad that most of the area is indoor. There are lot of rooms with different themes/regions. My three years old enjoy stamping the booklet. There are also outdoor area that we can pet/touch the fish and sharks. It is interesting and fun way to spend few hours in the afternoon. Too bad it was raining so hard that we can't go to the waterfront and explore the area a bit more. It is a very clean and nice aquarium. Admission fee is reasonable. I would recommend to friends and family.,CP_PDX
40,Educational experience,My husband and I went to the alarum on a recent trip to Long Beach. We learned a lot during this visit. Who knew horseshoe crabs have blue blood?,delamfam
40,Very nice aquarium,It is a super educational and interesting aquarium with lots of touch exhibits and interactive exhibits.,Holly S
40,Nice aquarium but difficult parking,"We enjoyed our visit to the Aquarium of the Pacific. There are a lot of interesting indoor and outdoor exhibits. We had quite a bit of difficulty with parking. The parking structure was expensive and very crowded. There was a long line of cars and it took a long time to find a spot. There are lots of restaurants nearby but the parking situation there is also difficult. Self parking is very limited and there was a long line for the valet. If you're already in the aquarium garage, leave your car there and walk to dinner.",DCH47
50,Great day out,Had a lovely day here! Truly was a magical and fascinating experience. Very easy to find your way around. There was even a walk through area where you could feed tropical birds who were very friendly indeed!,Shannon C
50,fun and educational place for families,"It has a lot of sea creatures, very colorful and amazing. We were able to touch a stingray and other creatures. Very educational and entertaining. It will probably will take you a couple of hours to see the whole thing. There are a lot of restaurants and shops close by. Also the Queen Mary is close by. Very relaxing atmosphere.",297traveler297
50,excellent aquarium with a lot of creatures behind the glass and in front of the glass,Kids love. I loved it too. I could stand for hours and watch the jellies! Had a great turkey leg in the upstairs restaurant. Good for 3 or 4 hours.,Gary L
30,Nice place to visit,"It's a nice aquarium not huge but enough to spend a few hours in. We enjoyed it. We also booked the whale watching through the aquarium. It was a fun experience. We did catch a glimpse of one whale. The boat ride was extremely rough. Not sure if it's like that all the time or not. There were people who became ill from the ride. It was a 3 hr excursion, we bobbed around looking a the whale for about 30min. The rest of the time was getting out and getting back. A fun experience all the way around!",LZtrvlGrl
40,Fun little adventure,"Fun aquarium to walk around in. We went on a Tuesday so it was busy but not packed, which was nice. It's not a massive complex so it doesn't take very long to casually stroll through the grounds. They have a lot of beautiful and colorful fish to see, but my favorite to see has always been all the different kinds of sharks they have.",Kevin M
30,It was educational,"The trip was on a rainy afternoon and there were not a lot of people inside. We got to see a lot of things but not all of it. We didn't get to see the birds or the sea lion coz it was raining and it was closed. So what we just got to see were the fishes and the whales ad jellyfish and starfish and seahorses. They were great. Awesome. But, I think they can make the place a lot bigger and have a lot more species. It wasn't the best I've seen. If I would compare it to Manila Ocean Park, there is no comparison. Maybe about halfway nice only. I would recommend it for kids and educational trips. But not for adults. Just being honest here.",Sai A
50,Third Visit,We continue to bring our visitors and children here every few years. Super fun and educational for all ages. Loved everything from little sea horses to giant whale model to feeding the lorikeets. The jellyfish exhibit was fabulous and the kids lived the sea otters and penguins. We will certainly be back.,Lynda H
40,A day walk,Good for a day walk. Diversity of sea animals. You can touch some species. Bring sunblock since most of outdoors area is not shaded.,odar17
50,VERY INTERESTING,"Had a couple of hours here before our flight home ,there is loads to see and the staff are friendly and helpful. We really enjoyed the scuba divers talks whilst in the large tanks with the fish also the penguins and stroking the sting rays. Well worth a visit if in the area.",richard c
50,Must visit in Long Beach!!!,"We did not go this trip as we did not have time but have been 3 times prior to it. Amazing place to see and learn about the sea and its creatures. Great staff, always around to answer any question at all. Great facility to tour, clean and well labeled on all displays for telling us about the creatures we are in awe of inside.",dakotateri
50,Lorikeets are adorable and bitey,The aquarium is fun. It is very well set up for small children i.e. with exhibits that go very close to the floor. Lots of hands on exhibits.The aviary is very fun-listen to the docents and be wary of the lorikeets. One landed on my boyfriend and I made the mistake of taking it out of his hair myself. It was hilarious and kind of painful.I'd go and do it all again.,PersnicketyFlagAZ
40,A must-see in Long Beach,"The aquarium is well worth a visit, although entrance tickets are a bit on the expensive side in my opinion. The exhibits themselves are fantastic and very informative, and the range of animals on display is second-to-none for an attraction of it's size. Make sure you go and see the sea otters - they're adorable! A new area with seals and sea lions is opening in 2017, and I'm sure this will only enhance the experience.They do have a 4D cinema but it was closed because of school visits, which are they only downside - when we visited during the week, the place was full of school kids which made it hard to move around in some places. I know there's nothing anyone can do about it, but it's good to be prepared!Definitely go and visit, but try to find a coupon or discount if you can.",Adam R
50,A very special venue,The Aquqrium is very well located with a lot of attractions around it - very special visit with beautiful displays inside and outdoor experience including an aviary -,petitbouchon2017
50,Such A Cool Place,"We absolutly loved the aquarium!! There was such a massive array of different fish and sharks to mollusks and shellfish, it was very very cool to be able to reach into the water and touch some of the fish and sharks along with starfish and corral, it was alot of fun!!!",shagg2016
40,Nice way to spend a few hours,Enjoyed my time at the Aquarium of the Pacific. Lots to see but only took maybe 2 hours to see everything (without children that is). Would recommend this to anyone visiting long beach looking for something to do.,PinkParadise50
30,Need some refreshments,"Everything is quite old in this building. It really needs some improvement. I know everything costs but I was disappointed in the infrastructure as well as quality of the ""show"". I think they are already in due for some modernisation and that's good.",Nolofinwe
50,Mindfulness - jellyfish style,"The Aquarium of the Pacific is a lovely spot. The jellyfish are by far my favorites, and standing there in front of them allows me to let go of the stress for just a few minutes. The sea lion exhibit is closed for renovation (November 2016), which is another stress-busting exhibit.We had free tickets courtesy of my husband's employer, and we parked up the hill where parking is more reasonable (4th and Pine where hubby can park for free) and took the Passport free bus to get to the Aquarium.The exhibits are set up by geographic regions, so it's educational for the kiddos. There are many student-aged volunteers there, and it's great to see them lead tours and narrate the outdoor exhibits where you can ""pet"" the sharks and sting rays.Pine Street dining is just up the hill, and Shoreline Village dining is within a quarter of a mile away.",Michelle B
50,Under the sea experience,The Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach is a super experience for families.A lot to see. The kids love it.It is also a place for adults to learn about different spices of the Pacific ocean. It is Amazing,Olga D
40,"Beautiful aquarium, but a bit tight on space","I love aquariums. We've gone to them in cities and countries around the world. This one came highly recommended, and it did not disappoint. For a single visit adult ticket, it cost about $30. The displays are gorgeous, and the aquarium has a focus on sustainability and creating a ""green"" planet. Many of the exhibits discuss extinct or endangered creatures, and how mankind has created that issue.There are a huge number of families here, and we felt like we were constantly dodging strollers and wandering, small children. But this aquarium is made for kids; and there are a large number of interactive, hands-on displays for the kids. Employees help teach visitors about the wildlife, and conservation efforts.There are multiple options for snack food, including a Jamba Juice. If you're lucky, you might get to watch the local veterinarians work on some sea life. Displays are split between outdoor and indoor exhibits.",Russ R
40,Bring a camera,Great parking and restaurants nearby. Variety of fish. Feeding of the sharks is great to watch and listen to. This is something I would be sure and do if traveling with kids. Check Groupon for tickets.,Linda G
20,Nothing special,"We have been to a few Aquariums across North America and this was is by far the worst we have been to. We did a whale watching tour so had only had to pay $15/person more to get in here and glad that's all it was. There is no flow to the facility and overall just a lot of walking for not much stuff. We went on a Saturday and it wasn't to busy which was nice. If we had paid full price, i wouldn't have been happy with what we got.",klein3
40,Fun little diverson,"Stopped in here during a convention stay, during the week got there around 2:30 PM. I showed my convention badge and a $30 admission ticket ended up being $9 or so! Exhibits flow nicely, didn't see any movies there. Touch pool for sharks/rays outside. They have a lorikeet aviary, though I don't think they have public feeding opportunities (at another zoo, I was able to hold a cup of nectar and they were on me like gulls on a bag of French fries at the boardwalk!).I didn't have my kids with me at the time, but they appeared to have quite a few things for kids to do; play areas, coloring stations, etc.",Curtis F
50,do not pass this up,"This is a great place to spend a few hours or the whole day. This is fun for by yourself, couples, friends or the entire family. We took our nieces here for the day when they were visiting. They have lots of activies for children. There is always someone around to teach and explain. You can not get bored here.",HuntingtonBeachTess
50,Go on a Monday,"I went with my family on a Monday, and it wasn't crowded at all. Weekends are pretty busy, and sometimes on the weekdays there are school groups. It is worth it to purchase the family year pass if you plan on visiting more than once in the year. My kids and I love the tide pool area where you can touch the sea creatures! It only takes about 2-3 hours to walk around and read about all the fish and animals. Parking is easy.",Kelly_LNap
40,An Interesting Way to Spend a Day,"I took my four grandsons and they all had a good time. There are many interesting displays and tanks of fish to look at. Being rather dark inside it can be a challenge to keep track of all of the kids. There are tanks outside where the kids can actually touch some rays and other creatures. And like everywhere else in Southern California, you are required to like rock and roll. They even have it pumped outside on the lamp posts so there is no escape.",Jim K
50,FAMILY FUN FOR EVERY AGE GROUP !,"Almost missed this venue but went with a money saving double up pass. If you purchase say Queen Mary tour they offer Aquarium of Pacific for very little.The aquarium really has something for everyone fun ,informative and interactive.Make sure to bring the camera and comfortable walking shoes.Budget more time for cool stuff that pops up.Try to utilize Long Beach's fantastic passport free bus service. Hop on hop off to your favorite venues hassle free.",Madison S
50,"Fun, Educational and huge","The place is stellar. You can spend as much or as little time as you want. There is something for all ages. I took my 7 and 9 year old granddaughters. We started with the huge replica of a blue whale at the entrance. Then we went to the California coast to see the marine life in Northern and Southern California. Next we enjoyed the two story tank with huge schools of small fish swimming like a water ballet among the larger fish then we saw the jellies and the penguins. We stopped to get a bite to eat for a reasonable price at the Café Scuba then went to the shark lagoon to pet the shark and bat rays. The rays have their stingers removed for our safety. Then we enjoyed the sea lions and seals and otters. The volunteers are knowledgeable and answer all kinds of questions. There are two places on different levels to pet the sea creatures. There are separate tanks and displays for tropical fish from Hawaii, seahorses and sea dragons, lots of coral reef displays with fish up close. We happened to be there for the Autumn Festival and enjoyed Japanese Dancers and Taiko drumming included with admission. We got the AAA discount by buying tickets at the office before going to the aquarium. Tickets are pricey but well worth it. Parking is across the street for $8 with validation from the Aquarium. The aquarium does a pretty good job of helping us understand the endangered species and what we can do to protect marine life. There are lots of tricky corners and hidden gems with more fish. Get a guidebook and look for your favorites. We spent five hours there and didn’t see everything.",Ludwig L
50,Great Place. Worth the Money. Cubs Win!,"Its an aquarium with everything. Takes 2 - 4 hours to see everything. Have several animals u can touch and interact with including birds. Im 35 and I had fun, im sure kids would love it. and the Cubs won the world series after I left so this place is good luck Go Cubs Go!",musicofcourse
50,a most excellent adventure!,"the aquarium includes many of ""the usual"" things one expects to find at an aquarium, but i was blown away at the number of hands on exhibits. in addition to petting sting rays, sharks, horseshoe crabs, star fish, and anemones, i was permitted and encouraged to pet jellyfish! yes, you read that correctly. I GOT TO PET JELLYFISH! all my life i thought all jellyfish would sting a person or that a person's touch could kill a jellyfish, but i learned the correct way to pet a specific type of jellyfish. just incredible.highly recommend this aquarium.note: my hotel had a $5 off ""deal"" if i bought the ticket through them, but i would have happily paid full price when meeting a friend and her two boys here.",Becky Z
50,Beautiful,Well put together aquarium with a ton of extras and food places inside. They even have a coffee shop! Gorgeous exhibits and even touch tanks.,Michelle B
50,Loved it,"My kids and I enjoyed this place a lot. Expect queues to get in but then enjoy,it's large with plenty of activities and food places to have a break. Well worth a visit.",NorthsideCrew
30,Pricey but Still Worth a Visit,"These days aquaria and wildlife parks tend to be high priced if you are not a member. The Aquarium of the Pacific is no different. There are many hands on exhibits, fun for kids and adults. Several areas are under construction so no sea lions! This was a disappointment. We did not have any children with us, but I can see there is much to keep the young ones occupied.",Donna C
50,Awesome experience,"This is the best aquarium we have EVER been to, and we have been to every one from Oregon to So. Cal. Very clean, modern, beautiful, good layout, helpful people, everything about this place was well taken care of. The workers who interact with children and families were so kind, it felt like you had been long lost friends. Thank you Aquarium of the Pacific for an awesome experience.",Joel J
30,"Nice facility, but no big fish.","The day we went, there were lots of groups of pre-school/kindergarten kids, so it was noisy. Because the kids had special programs, there was no longer movie available, just the 5-minute ones. We adults were expecting a greater range of fish and ocean dwellers--there were no really big fish. All 5 of us were underwhelmed.",110kitty
50,Awesome aquarium!,"Really enjoyed roaming around and aquarium! The marine life was varied and presented in their various habitats along with pertinent information. Great attention was paid to the issues of endangerment and sustainability. Touch tanks provide opportunities to explore sharks, rays and other marine life up close. In the Lorikeet enclosure I was fortunate to have one of the beautiful birds land on my arm! This visit increased our knowledge and appreciation of the creatures that call the Pacific home.",Lori N
50,Second Best Aquarium!,"Let's not waste our time and try to compare this to Monterey; nothing does. That said, The Aquarium in Long Beach is second only to that. They're updating the Sea Lion exhibit at the moment, and are constantly enhancing the facility, making the experience more enjoyable for visitors. You can touch the sharks, rays, anemones, and other sea life, and see jellyfish, sea horses, otters, penguins, and so many others. My only humble suggestion... More turtles!",cbucka
40,Nice place to spend the morning,"We went there with our 2yr old and she enjoyed every minute . Wasn't crowdy at all, nice exhibits, but didn't find anything to see after an hour",AvivBarak
50,Mr C Thomson,Had a great trip to the aquarium. The staff were amazing. Got area's were you get the chance to get up close with small sharks and manta rays and also get the chance to touch them as they swim past you. Would definitely recommend it for a visit if your in the area. Special thanks to Kyle for looking after us on our visit from Scotland.,Craig T
50,Out with a friend,"What a fun day out. Pity we did not have more time. Sooooooooo much to see. Great friendly staff. Well informed. Loved the birds, yes, in an aquarium. Such fun to feed them. Lots of interactive stuff to do, touch pools etc. some great tours but unfortunately discovered them to late before I left Long Beach. Would be great to spend a whole day here. Looks well organized. Loved the otters and pelicans.",Claire O
50,fabulous aquarium,"This is the best aquarium!! Such a wide variety of creatures to see and touch! The staff and volunteers are friendly, helpful and knowledgeable!!! I enjoyed my day there and took lots of great pictures! I would highly recommend a visit to the aquarium!",spurtee1978
40,Long Beach,Been to a few aquariums this one was interesting and had lots to see but it wasn't over the top like some on the others I've been to for being right on the ocean I expected more but interesting all the same so it's a ive been there thing,Sam612014
30,Good for small children,Interesting and educacionalPlace for small children. Penguins and sharks were the best although I found the shark tank too small for the animals.,Marymonsalve
30,Not bad but better for kids.,First time visiting the aquarium. Most activities are geared towards kids. You can easily see everything in a few hours. Nice to see one time but you won't have to go back for a while.,Bob M
50,Grand aquarium,"Great place to visit with family and friendsVery informative especially for school children""Behind the scenes "" arrangement is very informative especially about the life of the blue whale - the largest mammal on earth",Scalfern57
50,Blown Away,"The only other aquarium I have been to is the Denver aquarium and I can now see why people think it is so overrated. The aquarium of the pacific is now one of my favorite places on planet earth. We got the $50 ticket that gets you access to the Nature and Science museum, the LA Zoo and the Aquarium. You have a full year to use the ticket at all 3 locations so on the last trip to California we did the first 2 and most recently we did the latter. I excepted, because California is on the coast, it would be a good aquarium but it was even greater than I had expected. It is really not that large in size and it doesn't have a ton of exhibits but what it lacks in quantity it makes up for ten fold in quality. I was blown away by how many touch tanks there are. I pet sharks, rays, star fish, anemone and crabs. We went around noon on a Monday, which is apparently the perfect time to catch all of the presentations and feedings. We saw a demonstration with a rainbow boa, an opossum, and a tortoise. We also saw the shark feeding (less exciting than it sounds). Everyone there was so friendly and informative and we spent like 4 hours going around to all the exhibits, asking questions and petting critters. It was the most fantastic day. It is also located on a very cute harbor (walking distance into the city) so once you have paid for parking at the garage ($8) you can go explore all around the area. I will definitely be back and have my wedding / birthday party here!!",Stephanie G
30,Something to do,"I'm not a super fan of aquariums in general, but it's definitely something to do if your Long Beach. Great for kids or adults or teens. Pretty interesting jellyfish, sharks, all kinds of swimming things in the place. They even let you touch the marine life.Not a bad day.",Jonah O
50,Good value.,"Lots to see and some we had never seen before. An excellent aviary where you can purchase nector and the birds feed from you. Lovely for children lots to take part in. Good restaurant, reasonable prices.",Pam920
40,I liked it. Kids enjoyed it.,"We enjoyed our visit. Huge! Wide array of sea life. Nice system of organization.SHARK petting pool was unique and thrilling to our 3-year-old. You see the sting ray petting pools in many aquariums, but I have never seen a shark petting pool before.The only aquarium that I find superior to this one is the Shark Reef Aquarium at Mandaly Bay in Las Vegas. That is MY FAVORITE. I love being there. The energy is great and it is beautiful. However, it depends on what you are looking for as if is also much smaller and does not offer near the amount of educational opportunities available at Aquarium of the Pacific. Since my children are 11 months old and 3, we really were not ready for all of that yet anyway.However, I did love our experience here, and we will definitely return when in the area. It was great to get a close look at the penguins - much closer than Sea World or Odysea Aquarium in Scottsdale, AZ.The Sea Otters were also amazing! You get to be right up next to them which is an incredible feeling.I really like the ""horses and dragons"" as well. I have only seen a wider array of seahorses at a seahorse farm in Hawaii. Very cool!",Kate S
50,Best Aquarium in the West Coast!,"I have lived in Northern CA and Southern CA, and this Aquarium is the best (in my opinion). The aquarium is located in Rainbow Harbor in Long Beach. There are a lot of restaurants in the area, and you can enjoy a ealk aling the harbor. If you live in the LA region, the annual pass is worth it. If you have little kids, they will enjoy this and it will keep them preoccupied for a few hours. They also have interactive shows where you can pet the jellyfish. Throughout the year the have multi-cultural shows and activities. My 4 year old loves this place because sea animals are her favorite. Great place!",JB B
40,Joyfull!!,Interesting place to spend at least half of a day. Many different kinds of fish and sea creatures. Also there were some shows but the best was the one with sea-lions. The staff was pleasant and polite.The whole place is well structured and decorated. Its location is perfect but. It's a little bit expensive but it's worth it.,Maria P M
50,Sea Horses and Jelly Fish,"I enjoyed this aquarium. There were numerous exhibits of the various species of fish in the coastal waters in Southern California and were informative and interesting. But the many exhibits of jelly fish and sea horses were the most entertaining for me. A good aquarium, in my opinion, located in a picturesque part of Long Beach.",ted s
30,"Great Aquarium, bad experience!!!","The Aquarium of the Pacific was ok, not on out 5-top list of aquariums we had visited in the past, many areas were under constructions, not less than 3 elementary schools had tours the day we visited, it was quite noisy, with kids running around, and the adults chaperones chasing them. Perhaps, they should schedule school visits at different times of the day, such as one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Luckily, our tickets were included in the Queen Mary package. Nonetheless, next time we are in Long Beach, we'll give it another try, as long as I don't see any school buses in the parking lot.",Victor H
50,The other side...,"We opted to visit the Aquarium of the Pacific while waiting for our afternoon whale watching cruise. What a fun and informative time we had! Coming from the east coast, I was pleasantly surprised to find exhibits that weren't the same things that I was used to seeing back home. (My favorites were the adorable little puffer fish and the tank containing the shark eggs which should've hatched some time this month!) There was an outdoor play area and a few large touch tanks for the kids to investigate, as well as a smaller touch tank with someone there telling you about the various sea creatures you were touching. There were also a couple of 3D films showing, although I think there was an extra charge to view them. (We saw the one about penguins. It was ok, but nothing spectacular.) We grabbed a salad for lunch. I wasn't expecting much, but it was delicious! The gift shop was huge and had a great variety of items. It was really, very nice. A hand stamp allowed us to leave the aquarium for our whale watching tour and come back and finish walking through later that same day. We just had to be careful to not wash off the stamp! All in all, we had a wonderful time there and would recommend a visit!",TracyB927
50,Summer,"I lOVE the aquarium any time of year. Great experience for young and old. There;s alot to see. The staff is wonderful and very knowledgeable. There are alot of choices to eat and walking around there as well. Very enjoyable for families, and dates, or even alone.",karenperez22
30,Biz dinner,"The dinner was excellent overlooking the marina.Quality was good. Service attentive.However, the aquarium it self was rather disappointing. Perhaps we did not see all, but the outside part was rather disappointing.",WAB-Valencia
50,Dragons and Horses,"What a beautiful aquarium. I was lucky enough to be able to see the sea horses and other exotic sea life.This aquarium offers a variety of educational programs, star fish and sea coral, shark tanks, otters, sea lions, and of course all of the fish you can imagine to view.Highly recommend a visit this aquarium!",Liz502
40,Small but charming aqaurium,"This is aquarium is small in scale, but the exhibits it does have are worth seeing. The sea otters especially steal the show with their constant rolling in the water, playful engagement with visitors through the glass and adorable grooming! I had been looking forward to the shark exhibit, but there were only a few sharks and they didn't have much space to swim in. Their collection of animals from the Pacific, including the beautiful jellies and sea horses is worth a visit and they have some of the biggest king crabs I have ever seen. There were also divers in many of the exhibits cleaning and maintaining the area, and I had never seen that before. I enjoyed my trip, although our aquarium in Baltimore is much bigger, what they did have at the Long Beach Aquarium they presented very nicely",TravelingTeacher
40,"Good exhibits, very crowded on the weekend","We visited on a Sunday afternoon, enjoyed the displays, especially of the jellies. There were many families with children visiting; it does seem geared to keep the attention of children, especially the hands-on exhibits. At this time of year, a Halloween theme was evident and many of the children came dressed in costume, an entertaining display of its own. If you are able to visit during a weekday, I would imagine that you would find less crowds. We bought tickets on the website, a good plan to avoid ticket lines.",ojerio
30,Nice place and educational for kids,We went there on a weekday but still lot of visitors. The kids enjoyed each area but unfortunately the sea lion area was closed and will open next year. Very educational and the place is spacious enough for those who were tired from walking around. We will definitely go back there once the sea lion area opens.,Natalie
30,Very small aquarium,"This is probably the smallest aquarium I have been to. There are lots off hands on touching pool for kids to touch rays, crabs and other fish. It took us about 40mins to walk around the whole place. You can watch the 20-25 mins long 4D or 3D movies for additional charge. Maybe it worth it to spend $30 a piece with kids or if you are really into jelly fish. But as for grown up I think this place is over priced and nothing much to see.",Sarah W
50,Aquarium of the Pacific Visit,"While visiting Long Beach my wife and I decided to go to the Aquarium. It is a very nice facility, excellent displays, and the fish that they have are great to see. There were many types and species that I have not seen at other Aquariums. The facility was reasonably priced, we were able to get discount tickets so it was a better deal.",Guido232
50,Great place to take the kids!,Very well laid out and there is plenty to see and do. Staff was very knowledgable and friendly. Could easily spend most of the day here and then have dinner nearby.,maxepr1
50,Ultimate sea life exhibit in southern CA,"Wow, the Aquarium of the Pacific was an extraordinary display of many assortment of sea life. Was very impressed with the coral reef recreation of Palau with its colorful variety of fishes and duplication of their delicate coral reefs.",chirata1
50,Good for small children,We like aquaria and this was a really good one - not sure why there was an aviary of parakeets though? The place was packed with young families on this Sunday afternoon and there was a special event for the Saltwater people which added interest,grannye
40,"Very good, but a little pricey","The Aquarium is top notch, but be prepared to shell out some money. I know that the money is used to help support the marine life, but they get government subsidy to do this. The different exhibits are all worth the time and viewing. I recommend going on a week day late as the amount of children running around the place can be distracting. The staff are very helpful and knowledgeable which helps. I recommend this aquarium, but as said it is a little pricey.",txmmoore
50,Amazing Aquarium for All Ages,Went with my 9 year old daughter and spent 6 hours learning about all different sea life. Touch pools were so much fun for us both! It was our first time touching jellyfish. Staff are very friendly and offer much information. There is much to see but it's not overwhelming to walk and see the whole aquarium. The café offered alright food. The gift shop offered a nice variety of items. Our favorite exhibit was the jellyfish.,Pukster27
50,Great Place for kids and adults alike,This was our 2nd visit to the aquarium. We have taken several of our grandchildren to the aquarium. We took our 3 and 5 year old this time and they loved it and were very excited throughout. They had so much fun looking for Nemo and Dory fish. They also were able to identify a lot of the species they had seen on Octonauts (a Disney children's show) and Wild Kratt's (PBS). It was a great visit and we will come again. We also liked the fact we were able to buy a Package Deal for for tickets to the LA Zoo and the Aquarium and we are able to use them up to a year after purchase so we are planning on doing the Zoo next visit in March 2017. Great Deal Saved $.,Ben C
50,One of the truly great aquariums,"I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed visiting the Aquarium of the Pacific. There were so many fascinating sea creatures to see - and touch! Highlights included being able to touch Moon jellyfish - gorgeous white creatures that are incredibly soft to touch (no sting!). There are also many opportunities to touch anemones, rays, and sharks. The exhibits are world-class. Be sure to walk around the outdoor exhibits as well: there is a bird enclosure, storytime for kids, and the shark and ray tanks. Gift shop prices are actually reasonable, and the selection of items is better than average. Food is so-so, however, and very expensive. Water is $4+ for a 20-ounce bottle. If you do eat in the cafe, bring your own water - or take advantage of the free ice and water (with cups) in the dining area. Don''t miss this really special aquarium. While you're there, go ahead and take the 45-minute harbor cruise (or the longer whale-watching tour). The Harbor Breeze is located just steps from the front door of the Aquarium, and is one of the best tourist bargains I've come across. A great way to spend a few hours in Long Beach.",lyndele
50,Great Behind-the-Scenes tour,"We went on a Friday afternoon at the suggestion of our friend, as the crowds can get overwhelming on the weekends. She was right. The exhibits are great. Such a variety. And the colors. The main focus of the aquarium is conservation more than just a tourist attraction, so no real shows outside of watching scuba divers doing some feeding. Well worth the price of admission.",br0za1205
40,Groupon Ticket Aquarium at Night=good deal,I love this little place. Usual aquarium stuff-I went during the Dragons and Sea Horses pormotion. The gift store is huge and has something in evry price range. A must see in LB!,debPasadena_CA
40,"Great Aquarium , def must see","Fantastic Aquarium, when in long beach a def must see . I would highly recommend for tourists of all ages",CATravel2011
50,Fun Times,"This is a great place to visit. They have a great collection of fish, especially jellyfish, sea horses, and sea dragons. They appear to be investing money in improving conditions for the animals in their care through facility improvements. There were also a lot of opportunities for interaction and learning about the animals.Definitely a great family trip!",Lisa W
50,Great aquarium in a cool area,"This is a pretty nice Aquarium to visit even if you have been to a few. The seahorse and jellyfish collection is the standout feature here compared to others I have visited. All the sea life in the tanks seemed energetic and active,which is a sign that they are managing their tanks well. The surrounding area is really cool with the Harbor, shopping, restaurants, the lighthouse and the Queen Mary in the background. Clean and safe area with easy parking in the garage. Lots of interesting things to look at and do - especially if ya have kiddos. Hint: call ahead to see if there is any special event planned for the day of your visit. Reduced admission days for various groups (usually youth groups) are common and you want to avoid these days (unless you are getting the discount) as the crowd of rambunctious kids can get pretty intense.",txyz
30,Small tanks and confusing map,I would like the tanks to be much bigger for the animals although the exhibits themseves were great. I didn't like how many of the animals were mistreated in the touch tanks. These were large and difficult to police so i saw adults grabbing hold of the sharks and kids touching the fish they shouldn't touch. The staff in the canteen were lovely but if a burger will be a 25 min wait I think we should have been warned when ordering.,bryony5950
50,Better than average!,The shark and ray touch tanks are great. It wasn't very crowded when it first opened but got busier as the morning,Surubu
50,LOVE THEM FISHIES AND PENGUINS,We wanted to get in one more visit before our season pass expired and it never disappoints. The colours in the various displays are something to behold. They have done a masterful job of lighting and it really enhances the beauty of nature. The lorikeet exhibit is a blast. Getting dive-bombed by what seems like thousands of these noisy birds adds to the adventure. love the shark tank and the touching pond is also a must do. The penguins never fail to entertain especially with the two 'new borns' stealing the show,SenorGancho
30,Perfect for a couple hours,"The aquarium is medium size and has plenty of small exhibits to keep you occupied for a couple hours. There is a small outside area for kids to run around and play with a couple small pools to touch some sea creatures. I gave it a lesser rating, because the value for the cost of entry is not as good as some other ones we have been to. There was a limited number of 'shows' also.",Ann V
50,So much fun!,"We're from California so we've done the Seaworld and all that, but Aquarium of the Pacific is just something! Kids had such a great time!",Elzajohanson
40,Good Day in Long Beach,"We recently took our daughter and six month old grandson to the aquarium. If you are looking for a Seaworld experience, this is not the place to go. If you are looking for a place that is more intimate, that focuses mostly on the sea life off California's coast, then this is a good stop. The perennial favorites, the crowd pleasers, are always the otters. There are pools that you can touch rays and sharks, without fear of being bitten, horseshoe crabs, stars, etc. There is a wing devoted to coral reef and tropical fish, so you will get your exotic lookers and great colors, as well. There is also a viewing station into the sea life hospital! A word of advice, do not go on the weekend or holidays if you can avoid them. This is not a large venue, and viewing areas and walk areas will get very congested. Go midweek if possible. You will enjoy it more. If you cannot avoid the crowded times, park in the outlet mall parking structure. You will save time. The aquarium structure fills quickly and it takes time to get out of the line and back to the mall parking.",Victor N
50,A wonderful exhibit.,this is a must stop for kids and adults of all ages. There displays of fish and sea creatures are excellent. Very knowledgeable staff willing to answer questions. The tanks are low enough for all kids and infants to see. Recommend this be a family adventure. Parking is near by but ware good walking shoes.,Richard H
50,Fun Aquarium in Long Beach,"Decently sized, if over-priced aquarium experience in Long Beach. Decent, but not mind-blowing. Good gift shop.",MikeAlen
30,Under the sea,"I would recommend it to people with children. Although, I enjoyed watching the fish the shows and experience was geared toward children.",Maria R
30,Too crowded to explore,"This was our first trip to Long Beach. We enjoyed the town and a variety of attractions and were pleasantly surprised to always have a bit of a crowd, but hardly ever feel crowded. HOWEVER, this was not the case with the aquarium. It was so crowded and it was like a stroller traffic jam at every attraction. It was a Sunday afternoon. Fortunately, it was included on our LA Go Card, so we didn't feel too bad leaving 20 minutes after entry. If we would have paid full-price, I would have asked for my money back. But from what we did see, the tanks look amazing. If we're in the area again, we'll figure out their least busy time and try again.",juliathegr82
50,A wonderful day,My daughters and I visited the aquarium before going whale watching and I have to say it's by far the best aquarium I've ever visited! Such a wide variety of sea creatures and all so well cared for. Excellent staff who are helpful and friendly. Highly recommend,Jo-MollyBennett
50,Great Aquarium and much more,Great place to take the family. We also did the behind the scenes tour and thoroughly enjoyed both the visit of the Aquarium and the behind the scenes tour. Top notch and well worth the money.,mjr0108
50,Touch the rays,"You can enjoy the shows, have fun, great information and variety. The best part is that you can touch the rays in the pond. Also, you can touch a kind of small sharks and horseshoes (which have blue blood - so royal). This has fun for children and adults. If I have the opportunity, I will visit again.",Mab0828
50,VERY EDUCATIONAL!!,"It was the first time I visited since 2009: it is even better than it was then!! Fantastic exhibits, very helpful staff and worth the price.",Frsacati18
50,Really good place to visit,"After spending a few hours on the Queen Mary we decided to pop over to the aquarium as its only a short drive. Car parking is excellent, there is a multi story next door and we got all day parking for $8 by validating the ticket at the aquarium.There are loads of fantastic exhibits to look over, they do seem a little obsessed with Jelly Fish but they are fascinating to watch.The Penguins and diving sea birds can keep you entertained for ages.Outdoors there is a covered section containing tropical birds which is interesting. If you are lucky the birds will sit on you ! (Yes I said sit thats not a spelling mistake ;-) )",alex965
50,Small but mighty in education!,"This isn't a big aquarium and all can be seen rushed in 2 hours. But if you take the time to read the information and speak to the education staff, you will learn so much! Also make sure to use the schedule to see the divers feeding the animals, or staff feeding the sharks, or pay a nominal fee to give nectar to the lorikeets. And dont skip over the gift shop because it has the cutest items! And all purchses help the aquarium animals.",FitnessTrekker
50,Nice aquarium,"My daughter very much enjoyed. Large number of exhibits, even have a small bird area. A must see if you are in Long beach.",RonVermont
50,Loved it.,"Loved it! Go early in the morning for the best experience when it's quieter. Awesome exhibits, very cool and reasonably priced gift shop, food is a little expensive but the cheese stuffed pretzels are worth it.",Miranda
50,OUTTA LOVE OTTERS,"Rated one of the top in the nation, I can see why. Delightful way to spend a rainy or cold day at this place. I love otters and here, they are quite active--to say the least. Their interaction with the humans are fun to watch, but they are hard to get photos of as a result. If anyone out there has any ideas on a hand-held digital NIKON, I would love some advise. Back to the review....I loved this aquarium and had a blast going from exhibit to exhibit. It does get crowded, so I would suggest right when they open for the day. There is so much to see.",KARIN D
40,Fun and Instructive both for adults and kids,"Second visit to this beautiful aquarium. The whale in the entrance hall is very impressive. Lots of instructive programs all year long. Love it, recommend it with my eyes closed.",Vanessa S
50,Amazing aquarium,"This aquarium is an amazing experience, second only to Monterey Bay and I have visited a lot of aquariums. The seahorse and sea dragon exhibit is truly unique and quite extensive. All exhibits are well-displayed, but there could be a little more specific identification and explanation of all creatures in a given exhibit. We have visited often and are always pleased.",553dianef
10,"Crowed, overpriced & overrated",This is for very young children only! Adults only or older teens don't waste your money! Weekends are crowded! Unable to see once inside because of people crowding and there's really nothing to see! Don't waste your time!,114glene
40,Great variety of displays.,Combined this with a Whale Watch. No luck on this day but 100s of dolphin.Aquarium itself is worth the visit. Up there with the best of many we have visited. Good mix of local area information and international. Pretty good mix of shows and some good 'hands on' if you're taking children.,Peter B
40,Aquarium fun!,This aquarium was everything you would want at an aquarium! Family friendly. Huge tanks. Variety of creatures. For all ages. Will be visiting again!,Dawn
30,Good place to go with the kids for the day!,"I live in the same neighborhood as the Aquarium, and it never gets old! We love it. It's not too large, so, you don't have to worry about the kids running wild and getting lost. At the same time, they have so many exhibits, that it's a day trip in itself. I recommend coming early in the morning or later in the day after 2 pm to avoid the crowds. The gift shop is great and there are gift kiosks located both inside and outside to make quick purchases. There are group discounts and free kids admissions with paid adults, so check you local grocery in town to get tickets.",chicagoborn40
50,Loved it! We will be back,Pleasantly surprised by the aquarium and our only regret was not spending enough time there. Excellent parking and there was a surprise around every corner. Something i did not expect was a large portion of the facility was outside. We will be going back. Spend the extra few dollars to buy the nectar as you pass through the bird enclosure- you won't regret it. Amazing day spent in Long beach.,danrodgerson
50,Amazing,"Loved this aquarium, lots of things to do very educational too, spent the whole day here! Recommend doing the Whale watching tour too which you can prebook online together with the aquarium tickets. Favourite would have to be the Sea Otters!",The_5ims
50,Great day to get away!,"Not just aquariums but birds you can hand feed, a SeaWorld like show filled with sea lions, dolphins, and lots of Finned Friends! Great carnival like snacking that is reasonably priced, and then you get to visit with species from around the world. Everything you can imagine aquatic from penguins to squid, to fish that actually glow in the dark and make their own Light!!!! Wow, plan on a full day to see everything but you will go away with a knowledge and experience that you will remember for many years to come.",Mike F
50,"Great for Kids, Fun for Adults, Good Facilities","The Aquarium of the Pacific is a great place to visit. There exhibits are well-organized by Pacific region, they have a variety of fish and animals--form penguins to lorakeets to sea lions and tropical fish--and they have nice facilities for kids and parents, including both indoor and outdoor displays, a touch-tank, a couple or restaurants, a nursing area, and an extensive gift shop. There are also evening for adults only with drinks, which is a nice way to spend some time. It's also located in Shoreline Village, a fun area with restaurants, walking paths, an arcade, a carousel, and other entertainment.",JuliaCat57
50,One of the Best Aquariums in the United States,"It seems that California has some of the best aquariums. There is Monterrey (a must), the aquarium at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, which is wonderful and there is the newest one, Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach.If you are on vacation and anywhere near Long Beach (about 50 minutes from Downtown LA) the aquarium is a must see.It is large, but not so big that you can't get through it in a few hours. They have educational tours, or you can just start walking, which I suggest. All the information you need is on each exhibit anyway.They have beautiful tropical salt water fish, fresh water fish and quiet a few of the big guys, sharks and seals. Now, whether these animals should be in a tank, regardless of size, is another conversation, but I will say, that the areas for the large fish is very nice and in perfect condition.There are some open areas where they have star fish and the like, that you can touch it you want--that is on your conscious, not mine.The price is a little high, about 29$ per adult, but it is worth it.It is a stunning aquarium and in a lovely area. After you leave go to Pine Street in Long Beach where you will fine great eateries and shops.Have a great time.",elizabethlascheid
50,Don't miss the penguins!,This place has come a long way - lots of good exhibitions. Love the jellyfish and the penguins in particular. Layout is slightly confusing but it is not too big so just go with it.,Katherine F
50,Fantastic Place for Kids and Adults,"My two children 8 and 11 had a wonderful time here. They loved the touch tanks especially, but there were more than enough attractions of all kinds to keep them interested. It is one of the best places to visit in this region. We spent the whole day. There are a number of places to get lunch, at different price points. Both getting there and parking were easy.",VacationMom201
40,Touch a Shark at the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach,"I love aquariums and enjoyed visiting the Aquarium of the Pacific with my husband and some friends. I loved watching all the amazing and unique fish, but the Sea Otters are by far my favorite. The Aquarium of the Pacific features a collection of over 11,000 animals representing over 500 different species in exhibits ranging in size and capacity from about 5,000 to 350,000 gallons. Shark Lagoon is definitely one of the highlights of the Aquarium. It is a 10,000 foot lagoon with more than 150 sharks. This expansive outdoor exhibit is home to large sharks such as Sand Tigers, Zebra’s and Whitetip Reef. I also enjoyed checking out the Jellies exhibit. Watching Jelly Fish is so intriguing and fascinating. They are 95 percent water, and their movements are governed by the flow of the water they live in. One thing I really liked about the aquarium was that there were embossing stations throughout the aquarium where you could emboss your guide to show where you’ve been. There were eight stations and we made a game of finding them. While I enjoyed many of the exhibits, by far my favorite was the Sea Otter Habitat. They are completely adorable and so playful. I fell in love with the Sea Otters! For more information about the aquarium and our visit, please read my travel blog post.",Samstravblog
50,A Jewel,"What a well kept, beautifully laid out, interesting place to visit for a few hours or more. Lovely hands on pools where you can touch rays, sharks, and star fish. Fun watching the seals, penguins and puffins and the guides throughout the facility clearly love what they do and loved to share their knowledge in an interesting way. I would highly recommend the aquarium - just don't follow it by a trip to the beach or the public restrooms!! Restrooms at aquarium are very nice - and have a restroom you can access outside the aquarium to the right of the building when it is closed - also clean and nice.",Louise W
50,Amazing,We visited from new York and really wanted to go to SeaWorld but found the aquarium of the Pacific and loved it,Jennifer S
40,nice place to take the kids,they have tanks that the kids can pet some of the creatures and all kids love to touch things and this makes the kids happy. There is not to much walking because it is three stories and there is an elevator. Lots of things to see and learn about. Very clean and just a nice place to visit,iamtariann
30,Fun time,Nice place... kids can have fun there... nice collection of aqua animals... guides n 4d shows are also available there...,Payal K

50,Pretty Cool Aquarium,"My elderly parents and I visited in early Aug 2016 and had a wonderful time. The aquarium is very nice. A lot of variety in the aquatic life realm. From playful seals to colorful little fish like Nemo! They had the coolest seahorses there, that I had never seen. Got to touch some stingray and some crabs. My only complaint was no fault of the aquarium...but it seemed like every Summer Camp in the area chose THAT DAY to go to the Aquarium. And that quantity of kids were LOUD. Not bad, mind you...just loud.",Debi M
50,Really special day,"This aquarium is really lovely. It offers inside and outside exhibits and is very well planned. There are places for children to touch fish and watch them swim underwater.I have been to some of the best aquariums, Baltimore, Monterrey, Paris, Belgium and this is really up there with the best!",Rosemary P
40,Fun place for all,"Cool aquarium...lots of awesome animal life...my favorite part was the birds that eat out of your hands, land on your shoulders, even your heads! So much fun",Chris M
50,"Another fun day at Aquarium of the Pacific, Long Beach, CA","Yesterday was our third year running that my wife and I have taken our Grandson to the Aquarium of the Pacific. Each year he learns more and appreciates toe hands on experience. I recommend taking your children or grandchildren and spend a few hours there. Visit their website to see what activities are going on. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance. With children, I recommend Bubba Gumps. The theme is a take off from Forrest Gump.",greatwine
50,Great Aquarium,Been to many aquariums across the country and this was one of the best. Plenty to see and do for children and adults alike. Interesting exhibits with enough educational information to inform without boring you. Outdoor area has a water play area children. We booked the combination with the whale watch boat tour which was also very good. Plan on an entire day. We spent about 5 hours without the whale watch and didn't stop to see many of the shows,iove2travel55
50,Great for young kids!,"There's nothing like watching your little one (grandkids in my case) walk up to a glass wall and take in marine life face to face!!While not as impressive as the Monterey Bay Aquarium, the Aquarium of the Pacific is perfect for the younger crowd. All the important creatures at a scale that won't overwhelm. Education oriented displays which are largely ""kid level"".You never know what will make the biggest impression. My two year old grandson couldn't stop talking about the sea lions, and his favorite marine mammal...the Diver!Be advised, the sea lion tank will be down for major maintenance and reconstruction from September through February 2017.",GLennox
50,Great Place!,If you're into the marine life then of course you should go! If you're going to do a vacation to this area there are queen mary and aquarium tickets you can purchase together for a discount. Outside of the aquarium is the pier with lots of shopping and eating so it is in a perfect location!,Nisla M
50,Best place,"If you like sharks, fishes or other sea creatures I recommend you go check this place out plus you get to pet the ray and see people scuba diving.",Jaspreet K
40,"The real "" Dory""","A nice place for kids and adults! Sea life is always colorful. Have mini water playground that 2-3 year olds gravitated to. Lots of shows! Places to eat inside and around venue, within walking distance. Parking is $8 with validated ticket at parking lot across the street.",Giselle C
50,Best Fishies in the World!,"I am an experienced scuba diver and I love the ocean's creatures. Second best to diving is going to this gorgeous aquarium.

50,Fantastic Aquarium A lot to offer,"This aquarium has a lot to offer from penguins to sea lions.The surrounding shoreline village area is also a blast.The mural on the outside is also nice, and part of some art exhibits with muralists throughout Long Beach",TitanHermes
50,Great place!,I won some free tickets to this place. It was my dust time and I loved it. They had indoor and outdoor exhibits to enjoy. People were nice.,Allanna W
50,Fantastic aquarium,This aquarium far surpasses the one in Monterey!! A great place for kids and adults! Plan to spend some time there!,Alex112201
40,NICE PLACE TO SPEND A DAY,"My favorite things here are the sea dragons and jellies. I like that they now have more of the jellies with bio lights, like the ones they have at the Monterey Aquarium. If you want something to eat here though I strongly suggest that you get it at the outside snack bar and avoid their incredibly slow and deadly Cafe Scuba. It will waste much of your time (you paid to explore the aquarium not sit here all day). I suspect the fish they serve here are ones that floated to the top.",Sandra H
50,Lineups but worth the wait,"This was worth the wait in a long lineup,great for family's and adults a little expensive if you have a big family but lots to see and do there",deborahcL4184CD
50,Family fun,this is an amazing place to go to for family fun! we enjoyed every moment. Lots to see and must say a great experience.,kimsmith589
40,Coming Up in the World,"The aquarium is expanding its exhibits and its connections with its visitors.Displays are nicely designed and easy to access. The displays of more interest have visitor areas that are either enlarged or multi-tiered.They have sea mammals such as otters, seals and sea lions, plus sharks, rays, and seahorses in addition to a variety of fishes. Penguins and lorikeets have enclosures outside of the main building.There is a parking structure adjacent to the building. In addition, several eateries are within easy walking distance.Mornings during the school tear can be crowded with field trips.Plan on at least 3 hours for your visit to see every exhibit.",LifesaSnap
40,Nice aquarium,Nice aquarium - buy tickets online to avoid long lines. Parking was a nightmare - our bad - a Saturday afternoon in August and spent over 15 minutes driving around garage trying to find a space.Aquarium was truly MOBBED but our son is older and we have had many aquarium visits so taller and can see over the little kids. Nice and easy set up and exhibits. Lovely outdoor space for penguins and sea lions.Perhaps it was the day and crowds bit found bathrooms kinda a mess and 'wash your hands after touching sea life' areas a mess. 3 paper towel holders and all empty of paper towel kinda thing. Not a free bench or seat anywhere but again was due to crowds. The staff we did interact with were very nice.,tber
50,Great day with the family,Got discount tickets from a work website and went down for the day with the family. Parking was close and easy just across the street from the aquarium. Was busy but not overcrowded able to see everything in a few hours. Good food choices inside and everything was clean. No lines to see a free movie about jellyfish. Great value,William H
50,Great place for the family,Was such a fun time. I loved all the Jelly Fish. And the sea otters. Also so enjoyed the touching pools and the divers in the aquarium. Great place for kids. Nice place to go to beat the heat.,Brenda S
40,I found Nemo :),The aquarium was wondrous and breath taking. So many different species. The touching pools were fun. Unfortunately we went when there was school field trip so it was crazy packed and like a zoo.,Jonathon b
30,"Expensive, crowded in summer","At $30/- far too expensive. We went in summer so got the crowds at peak period - can't really take in and enjoy the displays with so many people about. Okay-ish though. Passed an afternoon for my son and myself. Nothing too stunning though - seen a better aquarium at Hull, England.",2Sweeties
50,FUN DAY,I love the Aquarium of the Pacific. There is so much to learn about our ocean and the Aquarium is a wealth of knowledge. It is the perfect place for kids of all ages to learn. It's worth the cost of admission.,SteveFawley
30,Hot and crowded,"We visited the aquarium on a hot Sunday afternoon. What were we thinking??We had a decent meal in the cafe. ( everything was $10, service was slow but the food was ok.The aquarium had an awkward layout and while they gave us a very nice guide book as we entered, the map inside was not too helpful.But the worse thing was it was packed with people.. Like i said, i don't know what i was thinking.. A hot summer Sunday is not the time to visit this place!!!There was air-conditioning but there also were a lot of open doors so it just wasn't up to capacity.I would come back.. Early in the morning on a weekday in the winter!!",harrodsfan
40,Great morning visit,"Well done exhibits with many being interactive aimed at kids. If you want to avoid strollers and kamikaze moms, go early.( I can't fathom why people bring infants to this place) There are several places to eat which are not outrageously priced as well as several restaurants across the street. Worth a visit for both adults and children.",kagatlin
50,Wonderful experience,This is a must see - wonderful assortment of views. The pricing is reasonable and the entire visit was excellent - great for kids and adults alike.,suew0924
30,Expecting... more..,"My family has been anxious for a few summers now to come see the aquarium. We finally got the opportunity but we left feeling disappointed. When I think aquarium, I think of all sea life. This aquarium has an abundance of fish but very little to see other than that. There were a couple small sharks and some stingrays- that's it. The best part of our visit were the touch pools. There were several of these, we were able to wade through the large crowds to see two of them. One with little sharks, which were very cool and thrilling for the kids and the stingrays, the stingrays would splash and swim right up to you. All in all it was okay. I'm not really sure we would visit again, though.",Kayla C
40,"Cool, educational and interesting","Lots of beautiful aquamarine species to see, also have a pretty educational exhibit. Interesting experience to touch the shark and the stingray. My favorite was the beautiful jellyfishies and the cool looking shark.Food inside this attractions was no good, I'd recommend to eat prior coming in so you don't end up having to eat here because you're hungry.The gift shop here has quite interesting choices of stuffs to get.",badwolflibrarian
40,Fun- Find Coupons if You Can,"The Aquarium of the Pacific is fun for all ages. I recently went with two friends (all teenagers) and we spent a good 3-3.5 hrs looking around, eating lunch, and petting sharks and rays. We went on a Wednesday hoping to miss most of the crowds but the place was PACKED. If you can, come later in the day to miss the big rush. We arrived at 1pm and it was super busy- really hard to see the fish and marine life up close because there were so many kids and people running around. But around 3-4pm, it started to calm down a bit, so if you can, come for the last few hours of it's open time.Definitely take the time to talk to some of the experts if you can- they have lots of info to share that's pretty interesting.Be aware- lunch at Scuba Cafe is really pricey and not fantastic (to be expected). If you plan on being there for a longer time, bring your own snacks and water to save some money.Parking is $8 for the day and we didn't see any street parking.BIG TIP!!!! Find coupons if you can! $30 per adult can be a bit steep but there are lots of deals out there. AAA gives you 10% if you present your card at the window. We found $8 off per adult ticket coupon while paying at the window and ended up only spending $22 each. I'd definitely recommend doing a little research to see if you can find some coupons to bring down the cost.",TAW5
40,Nice Place to Take a Break from the Outside,"This is a very well done mid-sized aquarium with a wide range of displays and nicely thought out interpretive settings.Our teenagers were convinced they wouldn't like it, but ended up very positive. Not an all day trip, but certainly a nice way to spend an afternoon.",Travelbum2005
50,Great aquarium!,"We have been to many aquariums and this on still had more to offer!So much interactive for the littles (4 and 2 years). Lots to touch including sharks and sting rays!Fun water features in a play area for kids too.Check for after hours when it is half price after 5! Usually open 5-7 but was open 5-8 when we went, 3 hours for half the price was a steal!Staffed with many friendly volunteers who were very knowledgeable and great with the kids!Don't miss if you are nearby!",Michele H
50,Lots to see,"Was a great afternoon spent looking at the fishes and mammals that they have on display. Particularly enjoyed the sea lion and sea otters exhibit.There are a lot of schools that visit, so can have an even greater population of children than other museum-ish places.For things to do in LA was on the cheaper side for tickets.",sdds87
40,Great afternoon trip,"Nice place to spend an afternoon. Wonderful for kids and enjoyable for adults. Both indoor and outdoor activities. Beautiful tanks of marine life... sharks, seals, otters, jelly fish. Also has a place for a quick snack or drink.",Kay O
40,Great exhibits.,Every 5 years or so we go to this aquarium and just love it. Adults teens and small children find plenty to see and do. Parking is only 8.00 when you validate your ticket at the aquarium.,Theresa L
50,Loved this Aquarium!,"Wonderful exhibits, indoors and out. Everything was educational and interactive learning with colorful underwater landscapes that captured the attention of young and old alike. My favorite parts were the Shark tanks, the huge two story tank with every kind of sea creature visible and talking Scuba divers! The Parakeet exhibit was fun too!",Patti B
50,"Otters, penguins, seahorses, jellyfish - what's not to love?","A wonderful collection of sea life with some surprises, like the beautiful lorikeets. Our grandkids love petting the rays and feeding the birds and I was bowled over by the sea dragons and the mesmerizing jellyfish. The entrance fee is a little stiff, although I understand that it's cheap compared to many other aquariums of this sort. I highly recommend it if you are planning a visit to Southern California, and especially the Long Beach area.",jrhdrafting
40,It's something to do...,"We went to this aquarium because we have tweens. It's a nice space; there are some interactive areas (places where visitors can touch the sealife), a small aviary, & the jellyfish exhibit is OUTSTANDING. Takes @ 2 hours to visit.The parking garage was new to us -- it will ask you to pay at a kiosk instead of on the way out. If you wait til you leave, you must use a credit card to pay.",kmbdmp
50,Seahorses and otters,"we planned to go to Catalina but ferry was sold out. As a result we spent the day in Long Beach and this aquarium was a nice surprise. The otter feeding was better than the Monterey Aquarium and the seahorse exhibit was awesome. I liked that there were touch tanks, the sea rays were great and the jelly fish tanks were also beautiful.",PetOwnerBrooklyn_NY
50,Loved the animal medical center and jellies,"We spent an afternoon here after disembarking a cruise ship. Saturday afternoon was crowded but well worth the trip. We loved seeing the surgery suite for ailing animals and the fish anesthesia equipment. Also, this was the best jellyfish display I've ever seen anywhere. Our usually ""bored"" teen grandson even took photos. The Scuba Cafe was good, and the customer service counter even kept our luggage while we visited. The whole experience was fantastic .",leesvillelake
50,Very Beautiful aquarium fun and exciting,we had a very great time with the kids while on vacation we really enjoyed it and loved the views!!!! its a perfect place to enjoy with the family,melissa m
50,Family Fun Day,"I love that my kids who are 13 and 22 still enjoy coming here to see the exhibits. They love the jelly fish, sea dragons, and sea horses the most. Not something every aquarium has.",Katherine H
50,Love Me Some. LBC,Long Beach is a wander and gem to enjoy. The aquarium is situated perfectly in a prime area in LBC. Kids feel like their part of the Nemo / Dori crew as soon as they walk in. Its a fun few hours. Petting ocean life & watching them in shows & tanks us a treat for anyone to see. Your eyes will be amazed!,Adnana_Mendieta
50,Loved it! Loved it!,"We've been to several aquariums (including Monterrey Bay) so we almost didn't go to this one. However, with a free afternoon, we decided to take a chance - and it was remarkable! There are so many different and extensive exhibits to see! Although it was summer and there seemed to be a million children in the building, we thoroughly enjoyed every bit of the museum. Truly an amazing and awe-inspiring place! Don't miss it!",SusanD55
50,Really worth visiting! Give yourself at least 3-4 hrs.,"What an amazing place! So many exhibits and interactive activities for kids. We loved watching the sea otters and the sea lions and touching all of the animals in the touch tanks. It was educational and entertaining. There are places to eat inside, 3-D movie experiences, and you can feed the lorikeets. If you're going in the summer, you can expect lots of summer camp groups in the morning. We went at 1:30 PM and there were still a few groups but not as crowded as it would have been in the morning. Make sure you get your parking ticket validated at the aquarium so you only pay $8. The aquarium has two levels of exhibits so give yourself at least 3 1/2 to 4 hours see you have a chance to see everything and take your time. We really liked all of the education stations set up throughout the aquarium for kids to play games while learning about protecting our marine life and environment.",Shannon M
50,Nice for children,"We had a wonderful time, learned and enjoyed. People at the aquarium really irradiates love for animals. My daughter (4) loved it.",Pilar C
50,Great Place and Location,"The Long Beach Aquarium of the Pacific is the perfect place to spend a day and look at the fishies! The kids will love it and if it's just a date, still a great place to go. Exhibits are well taken care of and there is plenty to see.HOWEVER, there is a big downside to this place...it's popularity. Despite the size of the Aquarium, it's not small, the Aquarium can quickly turn into a cluster (you know what) of people going in and out of the exhibits. If it's crowded, viewing will be limited and obstructed. If that happens, you may be forced to go outside but that's no biggie because the Aquarium sits next to the shore along with great restaurants near by.Parking is right across the way, easy in, easy out.Overall....Great place to spend a couple of hours.*TRAVEL TIP* Don't go during the Long Beach Grand Prix. Although the event is only one day, Grand Prix officials set up weeks before the event. Shoreline Drive is partially set up like a race track and leading up to the race day and after, there may be street closures. This event typically occurs in April.",gcfam79
50,A Lovely Aquarium,"The Aquarium of the Pacific is a gem. The displays are informative and often though provoking. I believe the obligation to make visitors conscious and concerned about conservation and ecology is adequately fulfilled. With this being said, the fun factor is great as well. To be able to touch so many great sea creatures is very appealing and endearing. Who knew I would think a horseshoe crab cute? My kids loved this interactive, playful, and interesting aquarium. Quite honestly, I loved it too.",Anthony M
50,birthday fun,I took my son here for his birthday. he really enjoys water wild life. there was alot of see and the touch pounds where great too. they even gave him a birthday pin so ever3 knew it was his birthday,vannesajishmael

50,One Great Day!,"As locals, we rarely get to our own city Aquarium....but then have out of town visitors and it is one of the most desired stops....and rightfully so! This aquarium is well thought out - has a huge variety of exhibits! Parking is easy and the location is on the harbor of Long Beach - gorgeous! I recommend this for visitors and locals alike!!",Geoff S
50,Great Experience,"We went here during visit for Arsenal match. Great variety of life on display. It was crowded on a Saturday afternoon, but seeing al the kids enjoying the critters was fun as well. Jellies and Sea Horses was or favorite.",Traveling teachers
50,Fun day,Went to the aquarium with my wife and my daughter we also really enjoyed our visit there. Lots of attractions and Hands-On experiences. Every of the Long Beach area for a visit or if you just live here it's a place you must visit. Have fun.,Greg S
50,Nice variety of marine life!,This aquarium has very good facilities and a nice variety of marine life. My kids were amazed by the different types of sea horses and by the penguins.,LGSanchez
40,Nice Educational but to many rug rats for me,Great place to visit lots of fish and education enjoyed it for a quick one-hour visit but way too many people in here lots of kids and field trips from school I think,Paul O

50,Awesome Aquarium at Long Beach,"Very beautiful and interesting Aquarium. Several different fishes, crabs, sharks, starfishes, jellyfishes, etc.Restaurant and coffee shops. Gift shoop.",Luiz Alfredo C
30,"Might be a nice aquarium, too crowded to tell","Billed as the second largest aquarium on the pacific coast (after monterey bay). The parking was easy to find and use. Entry was quick and the price was reasonable. It is summer so we were expecting a busy aquarium but it far exceeded even our worst case scenario. I'm not sure what ""capacity"" is for the venue, but it had to have been close. There were at least 6 summer camp field trips there on the Thursday we went. Almost all of preschool age. The poor chaperones were doing the very best they could, but.It was clear that they were trying to manage crowds as many of their exhibits had rope lines so that you could file past the aquarium and view what was inside. The lines to enter these exhibits were extremely long. Exhibits without the rope lines were packed 6 feet deep with people.The crowding led to us skipping many of the exhibit areas and just viewing what small displays we could.We had a nice lunch on the upstairs patio - the crowds seemed to miss the cafe as it was the only area not packed to capacity. It was busy but there was always at least one table available for arriving diners.In the end we spent less than two hours. A staff member gave us a great tip, if you stay less then 2.5 hours don't have your parking pass validated because it is cheaper to pay the hourly rate.A sign at the entry letting us know that there were many field trips there that day, may have persuaded us to come later in the day or reschedule our visit.In the end it was difficult to evaluate the quality of the exhibits, it was just too crowded.",Aysha
40,Good exibits but super crowded,"We took the water taxi from our hotel over to the Aquarium today, Sunday. If possible, purchase your tickets in advance, otherwise you could be waiting in line for a while. There were a lot of families with smaller children and strollers, which can add to the congestion at the viewing areas. It is nice that you can interact with some exhibits, such as the lorikeet forest and shark lagoon.",DMK
50,Mother daughter day,We went for a fun day out. Had a great time crowded so get there early but it was fun. Jellyfish and Sea dragons were awesome.,Victoria W
50,Fantastic place for the kids,"This is a great place to take my son and his friends, not to mention out of town relatives. There is a wide variety of sea life on display, and there are always enough unusual animals to capture the interests of adults and kids alike. We have had season passes to the aquarium for a few years, and it is well worth the cost.",Kirk M
40,What a great place!,"We visited the aquarium on a summer Sunday evening. This is a discounted entrance to the venue, but the majority of exhibits are still open, which was great! We truly enjoyed the opportunity to interact with the animals and learn about the efforts to conserve the lives of the land and animals in the area. We would certainly visit again.",Mrs_G_11_05
50,Great place to spend an afternoon.,"Late one day, I finished up around 3. So I grabbed my wife and we spent 2 hours here before our conference celebration. Well worth the small window because we did not lose any time to traffic and we could see it all at a fast pace. As a Gulf/Atlantic resident, I am well aware of our waters but the Pacific is a more of a mystery. This has great exhibits with actual Pacific habitat and species. Of course the star is the sharks and seals but they also have local trout exhibits and well as otter and birds. All of it was educational and well presented. It was smaller than New Orleans or Atlanta, still I was amazing the variety and diversity it does have. We really enjoyed. However be sure to bring in your parking ticket and don't loose it as I did. Luckily the staff was very nice and gave me a validated ticket. Again small but very diverse aquarium. Make sure you visit and I agree best attraction in Long Beach.",Grover R
50,Great place to take kids,"I received a 50% off adult and child admission postcard in the mail so I took a 5 year old boy and 7 year old girl. We all had a great time!! The educational shows, the extremely nice and helpful staff, and the beautiful exhibits made for a great day. I recommend the aquarium for anyone looking to have a nice educational day with or without children. The Long Beach Aquarium is a must see!!",Jynnjynn
40,Interesting,"This aquarium is not too big, and the teaching areas all around were great. Lots of things to read and learn for all of us.Our teenagers liked it, but I believe families with smaller children will enjoy it evenmore.",Stine71
50,"Beautiful, informative, affordable & fun!","I've been to many aquariums, but this one was one of the absolute best. For example, other places I've seen have had at least one cloudy tank but each one here at the Aquarium of the Pacific was spotless and crystal clear. The exhibits are thoughtfully laid out and everything is informative and interesting. One big plus was affordability — parking, for instance, was capped if you have aquarium tickets. The tickets themselves were cheaper than at similar establishments in California and even the prices in the gift shop were generally less painful on the wallet.We brought our own lunch so I can't comment on the food there, but there seem to be a reasonable number of options in the area.Overall, I'm really glad we came to this aquarium and super grateful to the local friend who recommended it!",choralmelody
50,DO NOT MISS THIS ONE!!!,"Babies to Grandparents will love this spectacular Aquarium of the Pacific!There is SO much to SEE and DO for everyone to enjoy. Well managed and maintained, outstanding knowledgable friendly staff, gorgeous building and fabulous exhibits.Don't miss the Sea Horse exhibits, the walk through Bird Aviary, shark petting pool, on and on....My favorite: the floor to very high ceiling aquariums with the friendly expert divers who make a point of waving and communicating eye to eye, hand to hand (on the glass) with awestruck youngsters wondering ""is it a fish or a human being in there waving to me?:-)"".Terrific shop with many great books for all ages, along with higher quality items that are educational, practical and useable.Much more so than the standard ""gift shop items"" that are soon tossed away and a waste of money.",clearbrook6

50,A excellent day trip - to the Aquarium and other nearby places -with or without car!,"The whole building of the Aquarium itself is not as big as I expected it to be but there is definitely plenty there to look at and be totally amazed. It is a great place in my opinion - not only for kids but for adults too. It is nice, clean, quiet, has a nice shop, videos, hands on for kids, quite a number of indoors exhibits and also some outside. The exhibits can change from time to time.It is in a great location - right by the marina and shops nearby - so enough variety to make it into a good day trip. also right by there one can get a boat trip to see the whales. Many may not know this but there are free buses around Longbeach - so if you take a Metro train there for example as I did for the fun of it, which is a quick trip from L.A Union Stn and extremely cheap at $ 7 - when you get off just hop onto a free bus about 100 yds down the street and in 5 minutes you'll be at the Aquarium (it also stops at other places of interest). This is an excellent service Longbeach offers.",Shoshana H
50,Sea life Rocks!,"We love the Aquarium! Our experience here is always amazing. We are the young grandma's to a 6yr old granddaughter and every visit with us the first thing she wants to do is go to the Aquarium. We had to purchase a Grandparent Pass that paid off the 1st time we used it. With this pass all of us get in free every time plus it's up to four grandchildren at a time that can come along and get in for free. I definitely recommended looking into Passes one or Membership😀We were just the on Friday for the new Octopus and Horses and Dragons Exhibits. These Exhibits are fantastic! We spent two hours in awe mesmerized by these beautiful sea creatures. Our Grandaughter just cannot get enough of this place. Over the past three years she has learned so much about sea life, from learning how to pet starfish, Jellyfish and Hammerhead Sharks to learning about the life of Penquins.The staff there are always informative, friendly and patient with the children. For those of you visiting out of the state or country this Aquarium is a must! If you asked our Grandaughter where she would rather spend her day, either at So.Cal famous amusement parks or the Aquarium of the Pacific she would yell ""the aquarium"" and we would have to agree whole heartedly for as grandmas we prefer this wonderful hands-on educational environment.Now get on with yourself over to the Aquarium of the Pacific with or without the kids because either way you're going have one of the best days with the kids or one of the most romantic days without the kids of your life❤️ Enjoy!!!",_reneelandacre

50,More than I expected,"My daughters and I were living in North Dakota when we went to Riverside Ca to see our cousin Sandi, We went to the Aquarium of the Pacific, and it was such a wonderful place to go to not just for kids, mine were 11 at the time. I would recommend it for anyone",Shawna S
40,Interactive,Our teens loved this aquarium. They had many opportunities to touch the animals and great teaching times.,Stephanie G
40,Meeting Room and Food Service,The Aquarium isa really nice place to have a meeting. They have the up to date AV and Technical equipment and the Tostado Bar was really good. The portion was enough. Just double check your contract throughly especially if changes are made because some things may fall by the wayside.,Lakerry
50,Nice size aquarium in beautiful downtown Long Beach,Beautiful location. Beautiful aquarium. Great for the entire family. Something for everyone. Lots of variety in the displays. Love to watch the otters.,S B
40,half price night,Look out for the nights where the entry is 1/2 price. At the full price ($30) I'm not sure it's good value.,John T
50,Amazing sea life!,I've been to the Aquarium of the Pacific numerous times and every time I have enjoyed myself tremendously. It's a wonderful place for every age group. I highly recommend this amazing place. It's the next best thing to scuba diving.,Alex H
40,Great spot for kids,I've been a member for some time and taken my grandchildren countless times. It's quite a good aquarium. The only one I like better it Monterey Bay.,jrg_LB
40,Good place for kids,This is place is small so expect to be in and out in 3 hours top. It can get crowded so make sure you go early to avoid big crowds. There are petting ponds which I found very cool and so did my little one. There is a bird cage you can visit for a small fee. And lots of sea creatures that kids will love to see.,Global647820
50,The best in the west!,This aquarium is the best in CA and possible the west coast. The Jelly fish are my favorite...along with the touch tanks. Make sure and see the scuba diver feeding the fish in the massive aquarium!,Melissa C
50,Great for kids of all ages,Being able to touch the sharks and stingrays is quite exciting especially for teens and younger children. Feeding the birds is a picture moment for all to enjoy,Chris M
50,so much to see at the aquarium of the pacific,"There is much to see at the aquarium of the pacific. it is beautiful layed out with so much sea life. very interactive from theatre to divers to special events that pay tribute to the diversity of the sea life and everything that is associated with it. a definite attraction to see if you visit long beach, and even if you live there. they bring in new shows all the time to keep things fresh.",Artur L
40,Day trip,"Went to the Aquarium with 3 little kids and they all had a blast. Nice place to learn about the sea life and discover all kinds of fishes, sharks and more.",Alicia T
40,Surprisingly Fun,"A great way to spend the day with the grandkids, watching them learn and explore. Check locally and with AAA for discounted admissions you will need the savings if you plan to eat inside- if not there are a lot of great restaurants within walking distance.",Virtualbob22
40,Extensive exhibits,"The aquarium has an extensive number of exhibits ranging from the common to the unusual. We especially enjoyed the multiple tanks of jelly fish, the seahorses, and the pools where you could touch starfish. When we arrived mid-day, it was incredibly crowded, but we took a break for lunch and a whale watching tour and when we came back at about 6:00 we had a very pleasant time exploring. (It was a good thing for us the aquarium was open until 8 that night.) We almost missed the outside exhibits thinking the doors were exits and we were too late to walk through the aviary. That said, we definitely had a nice time and learned a few things along the way!",diinslc
40,Great place to spend a day away from the heat!,"It's a really nice place with some beautifully done tanks and exhibits. They have some exhibits that change out in certain areas. The new thing since the last time we were there was that they showed a movie on the walls in several different places, which was rather cool! It definitely gets busy on the weekend and more than a little crowded, with lots of little ones, but you can find parts where it's not as crowded. Has a nice outdoor area with water play areas. Has several areas with touch pools. They have food, but it's on the pricey side. There is a parking structure and parking is $8 with aquarium validation.",Deborah P
50,A lot to see,There was all kinds of tanks and things to see. There is also a touch tank where you can see and touch rays and a small shark. It was awesome. The food at the upstairs café was really good too.,strat
40,So much fun!,"My sister and I spent 2-3 hours at this aquarium and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. There was much to see, and although it was crowded, we felt that we were able to see all that we wanted. The highlight was the seahorses! I have been to many aquariums around the country and have never seen such a variety of seahorse.specimens, babies maybe 1/2 inch long! They were beautiful and fascinating! I'm so glad we visited, a good outing.",Catherine G
50,The best aquarium,"This is the best aquarium of the six in the US that I have visited. Everything about it is done well. All of the exhibits flow naturally, so to speak, and the aquarium doesn't pander to those who only come to see the major attractions or who lack attention spans of more than a few seconds. And somehow the aquarium has managed to keep the noise level to a minimum. The staff is the friendliest and most enthusiastic I have ever met. There is a wonderful mix of indoor and outdoor exhibits. I loved seeing the penguins, the sea horses, and the jellyfish, among dozens of other great features. My only regret was not having arrived early to devote most of the day to an aquarium that requires several hours to fully take in.",Alan B
50,Better than Sea World But CROWDED,Terrific place. My niece and nephew loved it. But TOO MANY F-ING STROLLERS and people. They really need to make the parents keep the strollers OUTSIDE of the Aquarium. Otherwise a wonderful place to learn and explore.,DonSuttonLBCA
50,Crowded but worth it!,"If you have a couple of hours the aquarium is worth it! I've been twice, both times were crowded with school groups but the exhibits are wonderful! The shark feeding, the otters, the sea lions, and the seals were my favorite attractions but everything there was great! If you want to skip the long ticket line which can take up to 15 minutes buy tickets online in advance!",Ashley T
50,Awesome aquarium,"We were given a ticket for the aquarium with our YMCA informational pack..things to do in Long Beach, discounts, etc. it was very nice but hectic due to the crowds from so many gymnasts in to Long Beach from all over the US..very enjoyable...would have been much more pleasant if it was not so crowded.",Q2528CGjoanb
40,worth a visit,"There are not so many things to do in Long Beach. But the aquarium worth a visit. it's a little bit chaotic in the beginning, but the people who works there are nice and helpful, and the jellyfishes are definitely an amazing creature.",sophie ai
50,Great for every age group.,"It's definitely a great stop in long beach. My mother had a blast, my sister and both my kids had a great time. I could've stayed there for hours looking at all the tanks. The jellyfish in particular are fascinating. The staff is very friendly and eager to answer any questions you might have. The gift shop wasn't so fun for me. My kids love to go wild in the gift shop and as any parent knows... This means $$$. Also there's Bubba Gump right across the street so YUM!! And the Ferris wheel with fabulous views is just a quick 2 blocks away. I absolutely loved this place!!!",Amber R
50,Superb Aquatic Wonderland,"Visited here with my teenage son. Very impressed with the facilities, collection, and staff. My biggest disappointmet: the cafe, where prices were high, service was exceedingly slow.",DRW
40,Busy place so plan to take your time.,I've been to several aquariums and this was nice. There are some nice indoor exhibits along with the outdoor ones. There are several places for kids to pet small sharks and stingrays. We didn't have kids here but I know they'd have loved it. We went on a Monday and it was still quite busy so if you have your kids plan on taking your time otherwise it'll be a disaster. Also keep an eye on them as it is such a busy place and lots of places to hide.I thought the price was a bit high for the size of it but that's just my opinion!! All in all it wasn't spectacular but also wasn't a flop like some people say.,Tim V
50,Amazing,I have visited many aquariums in different countries but it was really impressive!I particularly enjoyed the SEAHORSE & Dragon sections! I had never seen these beautiful creature in person.Sttrongly recommend to visit.Good for all age groups.,Mansoor F
50,Better than the Mystic Aquarium back home!,"We were pleasantly surprised about the little gem. The exhibits were very accessible, with many opportunities for pictures and videos. The staff was visible everywhere and ready to answer all of your questions. All day parking for $8 is a bargain in their parking garage, which gives you a launching point to walk to other points of interest or take lbtransit to other places.",John S
40,Neat thing to do,"One of many attractions in the area, great for families, due to so many visitors - best done on weekdays due to the lack of parking, shopping, attractions, dining nearby.",bandit004
30,Not too impressed,Especially given the (from a European perspective) steep pricing I wasn't too impressed. As an adult it's not really worth the visit. With kids I guess it's very different.Not very educational for adults. The petting of the animals is somewhat disturbing. I can't imagine that this is good for the creatures.,Felix8000
50,Great place for children,"Took my two children in, and they both lives it all. The interactive exhibits where people can touch the marinelife are great. A lot to see, and very easy for children to get excited about all they can experience. The play area with water spray features also worked well to burn off some of the abundant energy the children all seemed to have at the aquarium. A must see sight in the Long Beach area. Only negative was the pricey parking.",Jonathan L
20,Unorganized chaos,"I needed a smoke by the time I was finished. The map they provide by both paper and via app was unclear and no help. There was no general directional system of walking or moving to the next exhibit. It was a bunch of people walking into each other and trying to figure out what was next. I also don't get why half the main features are outside in the Cali heat. Sweating while viewing them wasn't exactly fun. Size wise it's a smaller aquarium with underwhelming exhibits. Maybe I'm comparing this one to Chattanooga's and Atlantas aquarium too much, but experiencing them first, this one just didn't make any sense.",MelissaKP909
40,Los of great exhibits,"We visited the aquarium for the afternoon and it was definitely a plus. The shark pool, the sea lions, the many touch pools, the otters, the penguins, the octopus... so many great things about this place! There was also a little bird exhibit you could walk in and buy nectar to feed the birds. I probably wouldn't buy the nectar again as the birds seemed well-fed and not attracted much to getting it from people but it was fun nonetheless. We would totally go there again. Don't forget to take your parking ticket into the aquarium for validation!",Dharmagrrl365
40,Quiet Activity While Visiting LA,"Visiting from Massachusetts. If I was a local, I may have had more to say.We went to Long Beach to catch a ride to Catalina but the weather looked questionable so we bought a ticket package for the Queen May and this aquarium. From the Queen Mary, there is free bus service to and from the aquarium. Although there is ample parking at the aquarium, the parking at the Queen Mary was paid for and this was a not a go-go-go day.The aquarium is spacious and clean. We spent most of our time in doors looking at each of the tanks. There are outside shows but we (or I) did not take advantage of them. No food but there is a spot outside that sells ice cream.Across from the Aquarium, there is a Bubba Gump's Shrimp restaurant.",Bill C
50,Lovely Aquarium of Long Beach,Nice place to visit for families with children and solo. Exhibits are well presented and informative! Good to visit at leisure and learn about sea life.,norimer
40,Some Terrific Exhibits,"The multi-story tank at the end of the main level is mesmerizing; I could have sat there for hours just watching the fish, sharks, etc. swim around. The jellyfish exhibit is excellent as well.",MLLCoach
50,So much fun,It was such an awesome experience for my son he loved it. Only problem was some of the workers there were kinda rude but other than that it was an overall fun experience for myLittle man...,melkel1124
40,Take the private tour!,I'd never been to an aquarium before so my friends suggested we go on a private behind the scenes tour and it was incredible! We were away from the majority of the tourists and other folks (it was a Sunday so it was insanely busy) and our tour guide was very knowledgeable and friendly. We got to go to the top of their largest tank and feed the fish which was pretty cool. You'll also learn a lot about the science of working at an aquarium which is cooler than it sounds I promise.Just be prepared if you hit them up during peak visiting times to not be able to see all of the attractions up close or even walk through the hallways! I would definitely go back to the aquarium.,Cryptic_Tourist
50,A Place to be Enjoyed Time After Time,We bought season passes to the Aquarium as an outing with our young grandson. We have been five times this year and each visit we discover wonderful new areas to explore. The exhibits are beautifully presented. The volunteers are informed and enthusiastic. The sea life is spectacular to observe. I would encourage you to go early in the day as group tours can make it crowded. It is hard to complain about that when every child and adult appears thrilled with the experience.,hermosa29
50,World of Wonder,The AoP does a fantastic job with all their displays. There is so much to see and wonder at. In the summer try to go late in the day as it is super crowded with tons of kids.,Labonnevie_12
30,Not a huge aquarium.,The aquarium is OK in size. It does have quite number of different sea creatures and amphibian animals. The aquarium offers a half price discount starting at 5 pm for some days. Check with the website for the dates. You can still tour around till 8. 3 hours is enough to tour around all the pavilions. All the shows end around 5 to 5:30. So taking the half price option will lead you to missing most of the shows. But the entire aquarium closes at 8 pm. The full price is $30 which I think is a little pricy. Also you need to pay for parking there. There is an outlet just across the street and a Ferris wheel and roller coaster. Overall I think the trip is worthwhile.,skier101
50,First time here,"Staff was friendly and helpful, place was packed at 10am. Have to make sure to go outside and check out the petting tanks with the sea animals. Best part was harbor tour. Didn't have time to try out 4d movie",blueeyed23
30,Crowded Holiday Weekend,"First, I'd advise not to go on a holiday. It was packed. Very difficult to see the exhibits. Typical seaside aquarium except they did have penquins. They were too cute and the otters were just adorable.",Amy C
30,Nothing I haven't seen before,"Just average, nothing I haven't seen before. It's well kept with friendly staff. The attractions were not exiting at all, overall just dissaponted from the experience.",Jimmy M
50,"Lots to see, and family friendly!!!","I went on my birthday, and even though I turned 19 it was still really interesting seeing all the aquatic life and reading all the little facts and tid bits at each exhibit. I pet a few stingrays, and got to touch a couple sharks. They also do a sea otter show every hour or so where they tell you all about them, and also if you're one of the lucky audience members( which I was) you get to participate in a training exercise they do with them.",Dylan T
50,Wow...the exhibits are endless....,My 19 year old son still enjoys aquariums so we decided to look for a great one on our trip to California and we found it ! There is so much to see and the exhibits and variety are amazing. Definitely worth the trip!,Irishduff
40,It was fun,"We went on a Monday and it was still pretty busy, but not terrible. Lots of kids running around and obvious field trips, but we were still able to get up close and see all of the exhibits and pet the sharks/stingrays, etc. After being at Disneyland for a day, the crowd was much more tolerable and we enjoyed our visit. Was on our way to beach and it was something different to do.",Cherie B
40,Summer School/Care Groups Everywhere,"The exhibits are wonderful, especially for children...which explained the groups milling about everywhere. It was hard to get close to any of the tanks. I have definitely seen better aquariums and I wonder if I should have skipped this one. If you can, go during the school year, I suppose. There might at least be fewer groups, even though I am sure that it is a popular field trip. Adults might be a little disappointed with the $30 experience if they go alone, but children will love it and it will provide a fun family experience.Don't skip buying syrup to feed the Lorikeets!",Danielle B
30,Attractive displays,"It's possible that my visit was colored by the holiday weekend - lots and lots of people shoving and pushing. Regardless, there were some nice displays and animals, birds, and fish - just not always easily (or at all) visible. There was an interesting movie shown at one point on walls all over - so you could see it everywhere you were - but I was glad to be outside, enjoying the sun, quickly after catching sight of the super cute otters.",Jesekella
20,A place full of kids,"I went to this aquarium with my boyfriend and found this place full of kids and most of exhibitions and events are made for kids.The ticket price is US$30 per adult and there's no student ticket.It's a rarely small place that only takes one to two hour to go through whole place.Definitely not worth the price to pay a visit.The good part are they've got variety of jelly fishes and visitors can touch stingrays and some other sea animals.Good for family, bad for couples...",Crystal C
50,I love the birds,Love all the hands on touch exhibits. Great information on display and the lighting is great. I really enjoyed the sea horses and nautilus shelled creatures.,Mommamia04
50,Great way to spend the day,"I got the combo including the Aquarium & 45 minute Harbor Tour which was amazing. There is a great selection of sea animals, fish, plants, and Jellyfish in the Aquarium. I enjoyed being able to take pictures as well as leaving for a bite and being able to come back (just remember to get a stamp on your hand). There is lots to see, learn, and touch so I don't think kids will get board quickly.",kishealatkins
50,The whole family loved it,"As we were staying on the Queen Mary for 2 days with our daughter and 2 grandchildren ( 10 & 12) it was easy to take the water taxi and visit the Aquarium from the ship.We had heard it was good,so we booked tickets on line 2 days before.Good job we did as the lines were very long on a Sunday morning at 11am.We spent 2 hours walking round and found it to be one of the best Aquariums we have ever visited.The whole family found it very interesting.",PALMSPRINGSCOUPLE48
50,Lots to see!!,I was amazed at how much there was to see and read about. Absolutely brilliant how they have it set up. Their live shows were great!! I felt like a child again exploring our oceans!! Highly recommend for kids of all ages!!,Jean L
50,Excellent aquarium!!!,"So thrilled to have visited this place!! We were very impressed with the many displays, interactive touch stations, and many beautiful species of aquatic life. It was well-organized and laid out but not over whelming.",Kathy C
50,Loved it,"In town for YMCA gymnastics nationals competition. Received free tickets in our gift bag so don't know about pricing.Daughter 10 & son 14-1/2 yr both really liked the exhibits. Normally my son would be pouting and rolling his eyes during a family outing without his friends, but he was smiling and very involved. He even participated in many of the interactive & ""touch it"" displays they have. Kudos aquarium!You can make this a long or short trip. Plenty to do to make it a several hour trip or stop by, as we did, for a 2 hr run through.Got a hand stamp, but too tired after our opening ceremonies.",TroyAndCarrie
50,A great attraction for all the family,"We visited after 3pm with our 2 year old grand daughter and we all had a great afternoon. There is loads to see and some very good interactive exhibits - they really encourage you to touch some of the sharks, Ray's and starfish.Our favourite was the sea otters but there is something for everyone. A really good way to spend a couple of hours.",Julie J
40,Interesting aquarium,"The Aquarium of the Pacific has a good range of displays, including lots of 'hands-on' tanks. The food in the cafe was a bit dear, but overall a good experience.",JessicaTam01
50,Kids Always love This Aquarium,Our kids have always loved coming here. We have had the membership for years. They do a great job keeping the animals healthy looking. Food there is a reasonable price also.,Adam M
50,A must for kids to see,Be prepared that there are going to be a lot of people! Try to get there when it opens - such a fun interactive experience for kids,HeidiHooks
40,Great Staff,"Long Beach is very good, mainly because of its people but some of the exhibits are getting a bit tired. The preachy atmosphere is a bit overwhelming, as well, can't help feeling guilty just being a human! Environmentalism is a good thing, pushing it so hard in a place where kids are supposed to have fun is a bit over the top. If yo have only one aquarium visit scheduled for California, do Momterey.",Robert B
50,Seals and penguins!,"This is a nice aquarium! There is quite a lot to see! Most appealing seemed to be the seals, sea lions, and penguins. The stingray petting was also a popular attraction as well as where kids can touch a starfish.",Otg8rgrl02
50,What a Great way to spend a day.,Went with our kids 9 & 4 to get out of the heatwave and we were pleasantly surprised. There wasn't enough time to do it all and we didn't make it to the various 3D-movies.There are also a few scheduled interactions at certain exhibits. Well worth checking times up-front and spending a few moments planning your route to fit these in.Very educational - wonderful exhibits.Would recommend a visit.,KaarinH
50,Amazing!,"Went to a special night at the aquarium event ""Night Dive""and was totally blown away by their Jellfish exhibit! Fantastic colors and motions of the jellyfish looks like something out of a science fiction movie, well worth seeing!",Rantablin
50,Buy a membership,"Great to visit year round. If you buy a membership, you can buy discounted parking tickets. The Aquarium has a wide variety of animals and is great for children and adults of all ages .",B G
30,Just ok : the very young get the biggest kick,"You can't help but measure aquariums against others. Long Beach does not have the coherent and instructive running dialog of other large aquariums or give you a sense of what lies right off shore by bringing it in. Rather there is a maze of tanks that are interesting, yes, but nothing that hasn't already been done. That is what makes you want to return again and again. I have little interest in returning, and if you drive there and bring a family, it is an expensive day out ($30. adults, $18. children+ $8 for pkg). To their credit, they try to bring something new in every few years. Take the Metro, it leaves you off just a few blocks away and contact AAA or Ralphs for discount coupons.",artyfartyart
30,Nice little aquarium,"Got there at 10am before it got too busy. Parking is usually a bear, but no one is around this early on a Sunday, which was nice.There were several areas with different exhibits such as coastal, marshes, ocean, etc.Towards the back, there was a shark exhibit with some large manta rays. I was amazed at how large the mantas were and a staffer told us these mantas were small compared to the their larger ocean brothers.The aquarium is nice, but pretty small. We were done after about 3 hours.",John W
50,A fun day at the aquarium!,"I love going to this aquarium. It is a really fun day where you can pet small sharks, and rays as well as feed lorikeets. They have a beautiful tropical tank area where they have the most amazing sea dragons.Yet, I have to say that I especially enjoyed the sea otters, penguins, and puffins. I think this a great aquarium and it really doesn't exhaust you. Plus my 17 year old liked it as much as my 10 year old!",Emmie2000
50,Pick a weekday to go to avoid crowds,Great exhibits and. Live theatre. Look for coupons in local papers or online since the aquarium can be very expensive. But well worth half day trip.,Keith090808
50,One Awesome Aquarium,"While not nearly as big as some other aquariums (Think Atlanta's aquarium, for instance) the Aquarium of the Pacific is one of the nicest ones in California. The tanks are large and easy to see into, and the fish are labeled well.",frankoco
30,A nice aquarium,We went here in a large group. This is not that big aquarium but good for one time watch. They have a good variety of sea life. It's a nice place for kids. You can spend 4-5 hours here. I liked the lighthouse outside the aquarium.,Gitika J
40,Great exhibits and variety of sea life,"I am a huge fan of sea otters and sea lions, and this aquarium features both. The aquarium has large tanks with diverse sea life that includes fish, turtles, and corals. I was impressed with their seahorse and jellyfish exhibits, too.",Seiderjps
50,Something for the whole Family,"Took our 2 grandsons to this attraction. They were so engrossed in the aquarium that we had to drag them out. There are awesome displays and all displays are accessible at kid's viewing level. There are also hands on activities that the kids really enjoy. This aquarium is also educational in that shows how mankind and its depletion of the earth's resources are affecting their world for the future. As adults, we really enjoyed the sea horse/dragon exhibits. There is an indoor play area for toddlers to ""blow off energy"".",Kitty Y
50,Wow! This is a must see if in the area.,"We were visiting our son and daughter in law and decided on a day trip to the aquarium. It was outstanding! We saw everything from sharks to jellyfish to seahorses. The museum is organized, informative, and a must see.",Pat C
40,Great place!,"We've been to quite a few aquariums and I do have to say that this is one of the best aquariums we have been to. There's a lot more to see than I had anticipated given the size.There are indoor and outdoor exhibits. 2 water play areas, which had I known, I would've brought a change of clothes or a swim suit for my little one. 3 touch tank areas with sting rays, sharks, star fish, sea cucumbers and other typical touch tank creatures. Aside from the typical aquarium fish/seahorse/jellyfish etc, they do have penguins, puffins, different types of large sharks, sea lions and sea otters. They were showing a 4D movie which we didn't get a chance to see and also had an ocean science center which we didn't visit either. By the time we walked through, the showings had already started and we didn't want to wait for the next ones.We had a great time and our 2 year old was entertained. Their ""parking validation"" really means you pay a flat rate of $8. You can watch the tour ships set sail, or go across the street to shop and there's lots of dining in the area.",dachipperchicken
50,One of the best aquariums I've been to,"In honestly I would have given a 4.5 but had to choose between 5 and 4.It was a very interactive aquarium with supervised touch tanks, feeding opportunities. There were so many informative 'show times'. The information panels were also mostly very clear. I very much enjoyed learning more about the animals and I appreciated that there was a huge emphasis on conversation.I sometimes don't like seeing animals being in captivity but there were a number of rescued animals and they also seemed very well cared for, which was thoughtfully explained. I also didn't mind as much being that there was so much awareness being raised among children.",Marcimo_NZ
40,Didn't get a chance to come this time,Stayed in Long Beach for 3 days but didn't get a chance to come this time unfortunately as I remembered when I came here 10yrs ago Inwas impressed and recommended friends.,daikin
50,"We loved this place, so many seahorses",My cousin and I visited the aquarium while on a trip to Long Beach. We were planning on spending a couple of hours but ended up spending the whole day there. There were so many ocean creatures to see. We loved the exhibit they had of sea horses and sea dragons. They are so much fun to watch. There were also many different kinds of jelly fish. Outside their were different touch tanks. Kids would love it. We also took a behind the scenes tour. It was pretty inexpensive and totally worth the little extra money we spent on it. The guide showed us what and how they feed their ocean animals. It really gave us an understanding of how they care for their animals. Also each employee we spoke with was very enthusiastic about their job and their part in the aquarium. It was a lot of fun. We are looking forward to going back.,Karen M
50,GREAT PLACE TO SEE SEALIFE!,"Was amazed to see all of the jellies! so many varieties... loved the penguins, sea otters, and sea lions!",Loritc
50,Very nice,Pretty impressive and awesome. It was pretty clean and fun. I do think a few things should be considered. a) you can watch and touch many animals and b) there are many People there voluntary working there. Some of them look like 10 Yrs. of Age (I didnt ask them how old they were) and that is something I found strange. Still it was Overall a nice Thing to do.,AnnoBerna
40,Aquarium,"It's a nice place to visit - there are so many things to see. I've been there twice in the 10 months we've lived in Long Beach. HOWEVER - I strongly recommend you visit in the afternoon, when the school kids have departed. There are always packs of unruly children running, jumping and jostling everyone. It is chaos. It was hard to hear anything and pictures all included someone's child sprinting through. The staff is very knowledgeable and take the time to answer questions.",Diane C
50,Horses & Dragons,"Special exhibition...focus on Seahorse & Sea Dragons , always love going here , took my nieces when it first opened and go at least Once a Year , so much to see , learn & experience up close ...can even pet baby sharks !!!",Laura R

50,Myself and my girlfriend love it. I always donate and get the yearly family pass,Great location with good restaurants and makes for a wonderful day of being and doors and indoors at the same time.,kbjorkii
50,A Wonderful and Educational Experience,"The Aquarium of the Pacific is an experience found right in my backyard as I live in Long Beach. I loved all of the exhibits, especially the sea otters and the jellIis fish! There is so much to see in one visit. The best visiting times are early in the morning or late in the day. The very best time to go if possible is the first week of the start of local schools. The field trips to the aquarium have not started. .",Karen P
50,One of the Best!,"This was one of our planned stops while in CA on vacation, and it did not disappoint. There are many exhibits which all feature healthy animals. The place is clean and easily navigated.",mrkillie
50,Sunday Morning Family fun!,"Visiting the Aquarium of the Pacific was a perfect way to kick off Sunday morning and then have lunch afterwards. Our 3 year old grandson delighted in running wildly from exhibit to exhibit and we all were struck in awe of the beautiful fish, sharks, seahorses, penguins, and most spectacular jellies. Nice meditative space. A wonderful family centered aquarium with perfectly designed ledges for your little ones to safely mount and to peer into the gorgeous glass filled aquariums of all sizes. A very relaxing and well designed facility. Afterwards, we walked to the Yard House that was one of the 17 restaurants surrounding the Aquarium. The staff is welcoming and informative. Memberships and donations support this wonderful Long Beach jewel.",Fabienne N
50,A Diamond in Downtown Long Beach ;),"My kids are ages 4 and 2 and they absolutely loved this place! Located in Downtown Long Beach, this aquarium is dedicated to the sea life of the Pacific. The overall layout is pretty easy to maneuver even with a toddler and a stroller. Its one big loop that makes it easy to see almost everything.What I like most about this aquarium is that there are a lot of interactive things to do for my kids. They get bored pretty easily and these spots certainly kept them interested and they even learned a thing or two. They were able to touch starfish, urchins and other sea creatures. The staff here are very friendly and knowledgeable.Our favorite exhibit was the penguin enclosure. We even saw a family in there interacting with the actual penguins. Pretty neat but when I inquired, children have to be at least age 7 to enter the enclosure as well as an additional fee on top of your paid admission. Fair enough.. Just something for my kids to look forward to when they're older.The aquarium towards to end is pretty cool as it had a diver inside who waved to my kids. And if you're a Dexter fan such as myself, you'll recognize this very same tank (Season 2 I believe)Overall, this is a great place to spend time with the family and take in some of the great So Cal weather =)",VictoriaAllen
40,Thought there was more to it,"We took our grandson there to open his eye to marine life. It cost us a total of about $65 to get in which we thought was a bit high, but certainly less than the $300 we would spend to get into a place like Disneyland, or $225 for two adults and a chile to get into Sea WorldThey have a lot of exhibits and have a few sharks, Rays, penguins, and of course fish. Outside there is a bird aviary and for another $4 you can get a small dab of nectar to feed the birds. My grandson enjoyed the fish exhibits and petting tanks where you can pet rays and starfish.For me, I have been to other aquariums and was underwhelmed. Many of the tanks had similar fish in them, and they focused on North American pacific fish. There are many interesting fish found in South America, the South Pacific, Japan, and Southeast Asia. Also, we covered the entire aquarium plus the gift shop traps in about two and a half hours. The place is just not that big.",Chris M
40,Crowded but good,So much to see so many people to see it. The aquarium is clean and well laid out. A wide variety of sea life and plenty of opportunities to interact for the kids and us big kids definitely a good time. 30 bucks it's not unreasonable but with the whole family it adds up.,georgemaxson
40,Good,"There weren't too may crowds. So much to do. Kids loved it. Pet the stingrays, have parrots land on you, watch the sharks, and if the day gets too hot, go outside and cool off on the run-through sprinkler things",librabunny82
40,"Not as large as many others, but worth a visit","Compared to other aquariums, this is comparatively small. But whatever is available is tastefully displayed and maintained.",Madana K
40,Very cool,"Loved seeing all the ocean animals! If you have kids bring them! There's a learning center where they can took the ocean life, star fish, and other creatures I didn't really see as my husband and I went while on vacation together without our children. The penguins are super cute and the sea otters!",TKMartell
40,"Very good, but a notch below the best","If you love the ocean, undersea life, or just exploring and enjoying nature, then the Long Beach aquarium is well worth the time -- and repeat visits. It has a wide range of species, is very interactive and family friendly. The staff is friendly and even when the place is crowded (and it can get very crowded), it doesn't feel uncomfortably cramped. You should give yourself a couple of hours at a minimum, but can easily spend 3-4 hours if your kids are in to it. I would rate it a half-notch below some of the world-class aquariums, however, such as Monterrey Bay Aquarium and Shedd Aquarium in Chicago. If you enjoy aquariums, though, then this is one you definitely should see.",Dan M
50,a great way to experience sea life,This place is a must see if you come to Long Beach. Just come early as it gets quite crowded and parking becomes a challenge. All the exhibits are informative and fun to watch the sea creatures move around. Outside is also a good number of things to see and do. I would recommend this place for all ages.,c2230444617
50,The best we've been too,This was the best aquarium we've been too. My grand daughter's just loved it too...I loved the jelly fish and my youngest loved the petting ponds.,tanamiller
50,My grandchildren loved it,This was fun for my grandchildren. They loved feeding the Lorakeet Birds. They liked that they could touch sharks and stingrays. We went early in the morning before the crowd came and it was so nice.,Mary V
40,Nice place for kids,"Good lot of different species of fishes and aquatic on display.Not so much organized, not easy to navigate. Map was not that helpful",DDSIVA
40,Nice museum,"A little pricey, about $30 a person, but a good place to spend a few hours when it's too cold to swim. It has bright and interesting exhibits of many of the fish in the Pacific.",chivw
50,Excellent Aquarium!,This aquarium was excellent and had sea life that only live in the Pacific Ocean. Much of the sea life were very unique and placed in different categories according to the regions they inhabit. In the back of the aquarium on the main floor a huge tank will periodically have a diver swimming with a variety of sea life and talk to the audience while underwater!,Hope Soliman
50,You won't want to miss a trip to the Aquarium of the Pacific!,"This is a great place to spend part of your day. I went with my adult children, and we had a delightful time. It is a very educational experience, and you get to pet the fish. There is also a bird sanctuary which you can walk through. It's a great place to take children, young and old!",Marilyn S
40,Here fishy fishy,This was one of the smaller aquariums I've been to. It was cute and had a lot of different fish and jellyfish. I was hoping to see more sharks & maybe a dolphin or sea turtles but that's ok. I'd rather them be in their natural habitat. The kids that were there seem to love it so this might be a good thing to do with the littles.,missie1972
40,Daughter enjopyed it,"Very nice aquarium. Easy to get there with free transportation. Don't try and drive there, no place to park. Reasonably priced",Anthony W
50,Amazing :),"We did not know what to do next in Long Beach, so we just walked around and saw this attraction, it was amazing - many different types of sea animals. I definitely recommend it specially with kids :)",JuliettaTravel
50,Family fun,A great place to spend the day with the Family There is a lot to see in a very compact space so you don't have to worry about tiring out before you have seen and enjoyed everything.,Marc L
40,Great place for kids,"I came here a few years ago. You can make this a 2-hour visit or a 4-hour visit depending on how involve you want to get, especially if you have kids. The place was wonderful for them. Lots of interactive games for they to play with. The aquariums were amazing.",jt99941
30,Nothing special,First of all parking is 8 usd. Do they earn on that? Aquarium itself is not that big as expected. No big tanks. Not a lot of fish. Definitely not a priority if you are 1st time in LA,AlexanderKorablev
40,Great place to take the kids,"It was a very nice aquarium, but I guess I kind of expected more on the west coast. The kids will surely enjoy it, and they can touch several species.",Ron_Sweeney
50,Stephens Middle field trip,"I went on a field trip with Stephens Middle School, room # 105 & Mr. Estes. The tickets were affordable for students. It was great to explore & learn about the sea animals. It was tanglible to touch the stingrays & sharks. I bought souvenir from the gift shop.",khwong13
40,Interesting!,"Very enjoyable, there's plenty of interesting marine life from sharks, sea lions to coral reefs. The exhibits are pretty well laid out with plenty of accompanying information to learn more about the fish in each exhibit. I would allocate 1-2 hours for a visit, and try to get there early to beat the crowds, or go out of season. Decent value for money, with a modest AAA discount available.",SM_burghound
50,Memorial weekend. Great aquarium .,Fantastic aquarium. Very educational. Although it is a great place for kids there were way too many kids there for me. Children just did not behave and their parents didn't seem to care about letting them run amuck. But the aquarium is a great place itself.,Pristineacc
40,An impressive display of marine life,Impressive interesting placeWorth a visitThe children enjoyed seeing sharksAn impressive array of marine lifeAnd great store of souvenirs,David
40,So Many Fishies!,"I visited with a co-worker for a Climate Change Conference which in itself was spectacular, but also spent about an hour enjoying the sea life at the aquarium. I definitely recommend taking your time. Its a lot larger than Birch Aquarium in San Diego, but still doesn't compare to the size of the Monterey Bay Aquarium. There is a ton to see including touch pools, an array of jellies, sharks, sea lions, and even amphibians and birds.Your visit can be extremely educational as well, in fact, it's the best of any aquarium I've been regarding education. They have talks about sea life on both floors of the aquarium and signs around the tanks to learn more about the animals and their habitats.If it wasn't such a long drive for me, I would definitely visit again.",Coral
50,Great place to see,"This was my first visit here, great way to spend the day. Although Memorial Weekend was very busy, what better way to learn about our oceans and spend time with the family.I recommend arriving early because it was definitely crowded, but staff is friendly, plenty to see.Also, stop by the first exhibit to your right and get a glimpse into the impact we are making and the changes we can make to keep our ocean clean.",Pedro F
50,Nice but go early to avoid kids,We went early morning and it was great until all the school group started to arrive. Then it was loud and hard to see exhibits. Great info the sea horses.,Nalyes
20,Not a great aquarium,"Pretty bland as aquariums go. When my fiancee commented that we'd just about seen everything, I thought she was joking. Come with lower expectations than I did and you'll have a fine time. It's not unpleasant, just underwhelming.",Adam W
50,Not what I expected,"I have been to several aquariums and was expecting the cookie cutter type place that I was accustomed to.Instead I was pleasantly surprised that this place had a lot of things to offer people of all ages.Downside we went late May when schools were in field trip mode, so the place was over run with children. A little loud but if you are patient you can see a lot.Highpoint for me was in their lorikeet area. IMPORTANT TIP - SPEND THE $4 and get the nectar when going inside the exhibit. The birds land on you and drink from this little cup.. Some people had 3 or 4 birds on them.The touching pools were great and some of the sharks and rays they had looks amazing. A new exhibit opened featuring sea dragons (I think thats what they were called) and sea horses.The jellyfish tanks were amazing.. I could watch them all day long. The otters and penguins and sea lions were also very cool.The staff was friendly and answered any questions as well as giving you behind the scenes information, such as which penguin was the youngest and all about their nest building skills.For the younger kids (mine is 19 who loved it) there is lots of educational information and several ""shows"" as well.Parking is $8 if you get it validated at the aquarium and they have tons of shopping and restaurants in walking distance so you don't have to move your car.",LVgabeg
50,Try the Happy Hour special!,"The aquarium is fantastic but a little pricey at $30/adult. If you get there an hour before closing, they offer half off rates. There will be less crowds, less fussy children, and you still get to enjoy the sea lions, penguins and other exhibits. Their gift shop is the best one I've ever been to and the prices are really inexpensive!",Marlene H
50,Incredible Aquarium,I go to aquariums wherever I go and this has got to be one of the best. You can see every kind of fish plus sharks and otters and rays. My favorite are the sea horses.,Winkylee12
40,A nice visit,"My kids, 3 and 5, really enjoyed the aquarium. The hands on exhibits were great. For my husband and I, we enjoyed it but we have been to many aquariums in our travels and found it to be much like other aquariums. We were really looking forward to the lorikeets, something that would have set this visit apart from other aquariums, but it was closed today! :( It was a huge disappointment for all of us. This is the only reason for the 4 rating. Overall, a great visit but I do wish I had known about the lorikeet exhibit being closed. I didn't see any notices on their website this morning. We would have chosen another day to visit to make the entry fee more worth our while.",Anne0014
50,Truly amazing,"This is a superb place to see. Regardless of your age, I am confident that this facility will prove interesting, educational and certainly very enjoyable. My wife and I are seniors but visited with our son, daughter-in-law and baby grand daughter whilst holidaying at their home. Every one of us thoroughly enjoyed the visit and there is little or no doubt we will re-visit in the future. We even ate lunch there. I would have no hesitation in recommending the value for money lunch.",Alan P
50,A good way to spend a few hours,The kids loved coming here. They especially loved the outdoor inter-active areas. Lot's to see & do. Their high-light was feeding the birds.,girlieduke
50,Wonderful day at the aquarium,"This is listed as the top attraction in Long Beach. I didn't get to any others but it's easy to see why people consider it the best. After three days in theme parks this was a nice quiet day to explore the sea life of the pacific ocean. The exhibits here are set up in areas of the Pacific. There is the California Coast, Hawaii, South Pacific, etc. There are divers that go into many of the tanks and answer questions from the audiences. They especially cater to the children. There are other presentations by trainers of the seal and sea lions that are in the venue. All of the demonstrations are just frosting on the cake for the rest of the wonderful exhibit. Take your time and read the information on the various tanks. Talk with the volunteers and staff about the animals and the programs this will enhance your experience greatly and they are eager to talk with you. There are numerous touch tanks where you can actually touch the sea stars, rays, sharks, and other animals. We were there on a Sunday and there we a lot of people. Week days would definitely be more conducive to a leisurely day. Set aside at least 4 hours. I could have easily spent the whole day here but we had to catch an airplane home. I certainly highly recommend this venue and it is well worth the price. There is a place to eat inside and be sure to get your parking validated.",Don B
50,Top Ten Aquariums I Have Visited,My toddler was full of wonder and amazement with the large features in the main hall. The large coastal California fish were amazing to look at. We really enjoyed the Sea Otter feedings as well.What really got everyone excited was the sea lion exhibit where they swam all around and under you. It had my son running from one side to the other following these funny creatures from one side to the other.I really appreciated the numerous exhibits where we were allowed to touch and feel the rays and sharks as well as the shallow creatures like sea anemones. It was also very nice to have the play area for a small break in the middle.,Retrorambler
40,Graceful jellyfish and unique seahorses!,Being I enjoy aquariums thought we'd explore this one in Long Beach. I highly suggest going when they first open as it is very popular and will get very busy as the day goes on. Also buy your tickets ahead of time as the line will get long. Easy to find and large parking structure adjacent to the aquarium. But by midday it is full and you will be directed to other parking. It's not a huge aquarium and can be done by adults in 2-3 hours. With children probably longer so they can experience the aquarium to the maximum. There is a small cafe area inside as well as a movie theater. It consists of 2 floors and 1 outdoor area with touch tanks. There are 2 huge viewing areas where scuba divers are there feeding the fish that you can view and they explain what the fish like to eat. The jellyfish are so graceful and there are some really unique sea horses. Well worth a visit. Outside the aquarium there are various dining venues for all budgets as well as a nice boardwalk to enjoy.,Lynette51
50,Visiting family and discovered a gem,"While visiting my daughter in Long Beach, we went to the Aquarium of the Pacific. What a wonderful day we had. The collection of marine life is very extensive, and the lorikeet area was great fun. Highly recommend a visit here! Plenty of local shopping, restaurants, and the Queen Mary ship nearby. Enjoyed downtown area of Long Beach very much.",Tonya B
40,very impressive,"My sea animal-loving daughter was very impressed by this place. We got to watch them feed sea otters, and play and brush teeth. The shark feeding was particularly impressive- mostly because we watched from underneath the water. The sea lion show was great too. It was pretty easy to get around. Not impressed with the food selection and the smoothie cart was closed. Also, not much staff around to ask questions. But overall worth the trip. We stayed for 2 hr and saw almost everything but could have stayed longer. The kids stamp-your-book as you go thing was great too.",DrTravelers
40,Nice facility - Worth A Visit,"Two adults went on a Saturday morning and were waiting at 9:00am when they opened. It was not crowded at that time, but was getting very busy by 10:30-11:00. This is an attractive and interesting educational facility that is also fun. They have a wide variety of exhibits that include more than fish, like penguins, sea otters, lorikeets and sea lions. There are touch pools where you can feel creatures like horseshoe crabs, starfish, and rays. My only complaint is that the ""glass"" on some of the exhibits was dirty and smeared with hand/nose prints from all the children which made it hard to see and take photos. Some educational shows and activities occur at specific times, so consult the schedule. (For instance, the lorikeet aviary didn't open until 10:30am.) The admission is a little high at $29. We were able to get discount tickets at Ralph's supermarket and save $12. Note the movie theater showing 3D movies costs additional. They also charge $4 for nectar to feed the lorikeets. There is a cafe' in the aquarium and several restaurants within walking distance. Wheelchair accessibility is very good. You can park in the parking deck right next to the aquarium. Remember to bring your parking ticket inside for validation to save money - we didn't know about this and it cost us $15 to park for 1/2 day. If you pay at the aquarium or get validated then it's $8.",CrankingChick
40,Great day!,This is a very nice aquarium. Enjoyed a couple of hours visiting all of the aquatic life - the shark pool was a highlight! Go early to avoid the crowds and to get a parking spot.,SlotF16
50,Some amazing specimens,Wow seahorse like I've never seen and jellyfish too.Love the outdoor part and the cafe serves healthy choice meals,Val M
50,It was an awesome experience,"We got the package for both aquarium and going on the boat for a 45 minutes ride along the coastal line of long beach, and it is a really valuable experience. I recommended people stop by the aquarium, and also check out the marine area there too.",itseng_angel
50,Fascinating Family Adventure!,"This is an incredible peek into the ocean! The facility is well thought out and accessible to even the smallest children! If you go first thing in the morning, it is possible to roam without the hundreds of school children who arrive a bit later in the morning. Definitely worth a visit!",M H
40,Beautiful Aquarium,"I so enjoy my time here. Will most definitely be returning! Staff was very nice and helpful. Location was easy to get to, I walked from my hotel.",Arleemah
40,Learned a lot at this attraction,"We visited this aquarium on a Friday morning in April. There were a lot of school kids there on field trips, maybe seeing the facility on a weekend would actually be a little less busy. The facility is not brand spanking new and is showing signs of being a bit older, but it was still a worthwhile visit. Aquariums are very peaceful to me. There were lots of great jelly fish exhibits along with different ecological oceanic systems, ie barrier reefs, kale fields etc. The aquarium validates your parking for $8 which makes getting out of the parking garage hassle free.",Trainman95630
40,Best touch pools,"I was worried that this aquarium would be a let down after visiting the Monterey Bay Aquarium, but it was the opposite! We loved it! Their touch pools were the best! The exhibits are well done. There were swarms of school kids, but you just have to wait a minute and they move on and you have it all to yourself. Just be happy they get to go on a field trip and take your time. I would definitely go here again.",Rachel M
50,Beautiful design and exhibits!,"We came here on Mother's Day with the whole family - adults, a teen, and a baby. Everyone had a great time : ) However, it's one of those places that if you've visited before - albeit several years ago - it seems to shrink. As another reviewer noted: it was bigger the last time I was here!However, our 6 month old loved it. This is a great place for a baby/young kid to explore something new every visit - and way less expensive than Disneyland!Normally, $29.99, $17.95 and $26.95 for adults, kids and seniors. Under 3 are free. The Dual Membership is worth it, comes to $55 per adult for 12 months without restrictions, so I recommend buying that if you plan to return again within the year like us.",Katherine S
50,Even better than expected,Our family had a great time here! Saw a lot of things we hadn't seen before at other aquariums. There were even places to pet small sharks. So happy we made this a stop on our list! You won't be disappointed.,Jaymarti
30,Mother's Day visit,"I used to take my kids here when they were little. I remembered it being really fun. Maybe it was because it was so crowded or maybe because my kids are teens now but it seemed like it didn't have enough exhibits to keep us there for more than 1-1/2 hours. We still enjoyed ourselves but don't feel the need to go back again until they expand, which is in the works I believe. If you have never been, it is a great place but if you have been to other larger aquariums, it may disappoint. The tickets were $29.95 ea for adults but we purchased ours beforehand at Ralph's grocery store for $22.95 ea. Parking is across the street for $8 with validation.",Jeri O
40,Fun! Many features for free,Absolutely loved this aquarium. It has indoor and outdoor displays. There were many displays for people to touch underwater creatures. My son loved walking through the outdoor area.,Esm-diego
50,What an adventure!,A lil different aquarium expierence....Rehersal dinner venue which was spectacular! The outdoor space was turned into a beautifully welcoming dinner party surrounded by beautiful sea life. The area the aquarium is in well developed and has a great vibe! I would definitely come with the kids to explore more of the aquarium!,m r
50,Amazing jellie fish,"We had a few hours stay in long beach and decided to visit the aquarium and we weren't disappointed, although very busy we had no trouble seeing the exhibits on show, from Rays to sharks, even penguins amazing the jellie fish were especially good. A great place to visit highly recommended.",Jacqueline S
50,Best Aquarium in the World,"It's fabulous, from the jellies to the sea otters. On weekdays, go after 2.30pm to miss the school parties (packed with them), and look for tickets online at Trusted Tours of America. Save money and avoid the line at the aquarium.",MASBuk
40,Nice Aquarium,"This is a small to medium-sized Aquarium that can easily be seen in a morning or afternoon. I purchased a ticket together with a combination ticket to Queen Mary which provided some savings. It is well-situated on the shoreline in Long Beach and could fit nicely with a day of shopping at Pike Place and stroll along oceanfront lighthouse. Would highly recommend for families with children due to the outside exhibits and touch pool areas where you can actually touch rays and other fish. Provided interesting education on many species specific to local Pacific waters. Also, they have an excellent hallway of jellyfish varieties displayed in creative ways in curved aquariums with nice lighting. Worth a visit, especially with the kids.",Toby-Likes-Travel
50,A Must See When in Long Beach,"I'm a native of Long Beach and the addition of the shoreline many years ago was the best idea. Adding the Aquarium is one of the smartest moves going for Long Beach. The aquarium has a home town feel, not too busy, plenty of parking, an excellent venue to bring the kids. All the marine life they feature is exceptional. After your visit here, walk just a few steps outside to one of the several eateries and you have the perfect afternoon.",MsRida
50,Visiters paradice.,One of the best places to take your friends to learn about the sea life of the Pacific Rim. Great learning place and entertainment much of the year. Great for Couples Family with young children teens and a great place for friends and to show business associates and to even spend a day alone.,Benjamin R
50,Great travel destination to visit!,"We have an aquarium here in Utah, but the one in Long beach is 3 times the size! They have a huge variety of animals, shows, and interactions that are perfect for the whole family. We try to visit at least once per year.",nickh7777

30,Good,Nice couple of hours of fun. Has inside and outside attractions. Lots of parking and restaurants close by.,RAWITCH
50,home away from home,This is a smaller aquarium but for the price you can't beat it lots to see and do and a lot of hands on activities for both young and old.,carter2000a
50,Great day with the family,Great place to spend the day with the family. That's a good place for teenagers as well as young children... It's a very friendly place and lots to see,Danny F
50,Amazing Aquarium,One of the top 4 Aquariums in the country. This aquarium specializes in Pacific Ocean creatures. Love all of the various exhibits. Main tank is amazing. Grand Hall has life-sized Blue Whale. Adding new exhibit and regularly updates a d changes out smaller displays. Sits at the end of a beautiful man made harbor with lots of restaurants nearby as well as an outlet malls less than a quarter mile away.,Les R
40,Aquariums are fun - including this one!,"There are fancier Aquariums to be had (Monterey, Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, etc...), but this one is a very nice example. It's not as instructive as some of the other aquaria, but many of the tanks are pretty spectacular - like the curved viewing ports that you stand in, surrounded by fish. There are outside displays - the lorikeets are particularly memorable - and you can touch a ray if you feel like. I'd be a regular visitor if I was in Long Beach more often. Highly recommended!",NCDoc
50,AMAZING X's 1000000000000000000+!,"This by far is the best aquarium I have ever been to! For the price ($25 adult, $15 kids) it was a great value! There were so many exhibits and hands on areas. We got to see shark feedings, seal and sea lion feedings and shows, touch stingrays and shark fish, sea turtles, jellyfish, and even a huge octopus! All sea life was categorized based on their real world habitats. There were 3D and 4D shows and plenty of things to see. We spent 5 hours there and enjoyed each moment! Will most definitely be back!",LeWanda W
50,A Great Aquarium in a Great Area,"This is an outstanding aquarium and is a must see if you are visiting Long Beach. It is located by the marina in the Pike area, so there are great restaurants within walking distance of this attraction. This is the best aquarium I have ever been to.",PatrickLongBeach
40,What a good Aquarium,"This was a very nice aquarium, but crowded, must have been during spring break. It work good for us because we had a couple hours to kill before heading to the airport. We also ate there and was pretty impressed, a little pricey but good. WE started up stair and work our way down, Food on the 2nd floor FYI. We did not make any of the side shows because of the crowd. Price was reasonable.",Ran120
40,Great for a family outing.,"This is fairly small aquarium, but is nicely laid out and has interesting and educational exhibits including a jellyfish collection, sea otters and sea lions.They have touch tanks where you can touch animals (2 fingers only, please) including stingrays, anemones, starfish, and sharks (of the baby variety). There is a Lorakeet garden/flight cage outside where you can feed the birds.The Aquarium of the Pacific is open every day of the year, except Christmas Day and during the weekend of the Grand Prix of Long Beach.",CaptnGphs
40,Neat!,"I havent been to many aquariums. But this was a unique experience. I thought it was cool how we could touch the stingrays, starfish, urchins, and some sharks. I enjoyed it! Kids would really have a great time!",Cody S
40,"Small, But Enjoyable","Very small Aquarium, but still held up very well. There was plenty to do there and we ended up spending 3 or 4 hours there. They have animal shows early in the afternoon, an amazing theater, and whale watching.",Luqman S
40,Great Place to visit and see the sea,"The Aquarium of the Pacific is a local favorite for us to go to. The kelp beds, Penguins, sea urchins, and many other exhibits are fantastic. There is a Starbucks as well as a gift shop for knick knacks. Would allow 3 hours to get through it fully and enjoy all of it.",Kris S
30,Small but fun!,The long beach aquarium is on the smaller side. The downside to this is that it can get extremely crowded. However it is well maintained. The habitats are clean and well cared for. There are a lot of good hands in areas for kids which is always fun. Feeding the lorikeets is an additional $3 but worth it just watch out for flying poops!! Shoreline village is also a short walk away or some drinks or ice cream depending on your mood.,ExploringWonderland
50,Sea Creatures Galore,Always a great little adventure watching all the beautiful sea creatures. Not too big that you get exhausted and just enough to cover in an afternoon.,Rachel L
40,A great place to spend half a day,"While it may not be as big as the best of them there is plenty to see! It's not only an aquarium - the lorikeet forest is an interesting change of gears! a nice place to spend time, get educated on the whole ecosystem, but also just enjoy all of those remarkable creatures!",indreva
40,Free Friday's!,"Shark Lagoon Nights on select Friday's there is FREE access to the outside Shark pools, cool live band playing music. You can pet the sharks and rays in the small pools outside. You can also see all the birds which are very beautiful and entertaining! Check the calendar on the website for more info",Annette F
50,World Class Aquarium in a beautiful seaside walking venue,"Visiting the greater LA area? or Attending a Convention? you must visit Long Beach and it's long stretch of beach going all the way to Alamitos Bay. Start in downtown Long Beach (end of Metro Blue Line) to get to Shoreline area - you must visit the Aquarium - it really is world class, beautiful, informative and in a fantastic ocean/restaurant walking venue - if you are lucky you might be able to schedule a behind the scene visit - definitely worth it. Plan a few days in Long Beach, you can take the free Passport Bus to visit the Queen Mary also. So many boats/ferries - to hop to the other side of Long Beach or go to Catalina Island 26 miles off the coast. But start with the Aquarium and get your bearings at the same time!",LaPuce1228
50,FUN IN LONG BEACH,"I went to the aquarium with a group of friends. It was so much fun we did not want to leave.They have so much to see it does take all day.I think everyone should see this a at least one time,but note if you going during the weekday you may encounter large groups of school children on field trips. It can get really loud,but it just adds more fun watching them.",Jacque H
50,Kids and Grandkids love the Aquarium!,"Being a Long Beach resident I am able to take my grandkids here whenever I have them in town. My daughter was a volunteer for a few summers. The jellyfish exhibits are just amazing. The grandkids love the outdoor exhibits and being able to touch and feed the animals. And while you are in Long Beach, enjoy our wonderful sunshine and amazing skyline.",ClubDeco
50,Scuba diving in the aquarium,"A lot of other great reviews about the aquarium itself so I am reviewing their DIVE IMMERSION PROGRAM.If you have a open water certification or higher for scuba diving, this is the best opportunity to see all those fishes in the tank up close. You will see so much more than you think, the 45 minutes goes really fast.After making reservation online, go to ticket booth to redeem and to customer service counter to checkin.Someone will meet you in the lobby, and if you have family with you even if theyare not scuba diving, he will give you a tour of the pools that I will be diving ( pools are connected, 1 dive 3pools) and the behind the scenes tour. Your family get to feed dry sea weed to the fishes and see other fishing that are not in exhibit, some rare eels, shark eggs, sea horses, etc..After the tour the rest of the family goes back to the front, and I proceed to change.They give everything you need, including mask and fin, which some other aquariums requires you to bring.Also they allow you to film with your camera, which most won't allow.You get to swim in 3 or 4 of the pools but not the main lobby pool, because its too cold, at least that was my case.You get to feed, but no touch, take pictures and interact with other people on the other side of the glass. I tried to interact as much as possible with the kids even though I don't know them because you can see their smiles when you high 5 them or make bubble rings.The instructor will take pictures with his camera and give you the memory card, it's included. You get to see a lot of sharks and rays that can't be seen normally because they stay in the bottom or behind a structure.After the dive, hot shower with a free beach towel souvenir and t shirt.It was my second aquarium dive, some part of the pool has stronger currents, so watch out not to bump to the exhibits or the shark on the bottom. (Most or all corals are plastic but still be careful).I had a blast, back stage tour for family was a surprise and VERY FRIENDLY STAFF, not just your instructor, everyone is so friendly!If you got the time and certification, do this, you wont regret.",MICHAELRHEE
50,The jellyfish exhibits are unbelievably awesome,"Great education happening at all of the outdoor exhibits where visitors could interact with the animals by feeding or touching while staff were giving their educational talks. Inside was more read and observe type education. The Jellyfish exhibits are worth the price alone! I never realized how majestic they look while peacefully swimming in their tanks and I could have watched for hours.There was a race going on in long beach that had most everything blocked off so getting to the aquarium by car was apparently fairly challenging and parking was packed. My hotel was within walking distance so it was an easy trip for me. Due to the race, they gave me half of admission :-) and told me it was a great day to visit because the crowds would be much smaller.",David J
50,Got fish? sharks? with an incredible ethic for the ocean,"If you like aquariums, this place is amazing - best aquarium we have ever been to! Have been a member (like a lot of non-profits, memberships is tax deductible) each year for the last 9 years or so. We usually try to go a few times a year and bring friends and family. Price is not cheap but well worth it and not as expensive as other places.This is easy to get to - down by the waterfront - has a parking structure across the street (you can pay for parking when you get your ticket if you want - otherwise don't forget to validate - $8 for all day w/ validation). If you are coming from I-405, use the 710 to get there so you don't go through all the stop lights through Long Beach. You can drop off people in the front so they don't have to walk from the parking structure if needed.The aquarium itself is laid out nicely - lots of very big tanks so even when there are a lot of people, you can still see - many of the tanks are so large that to call it a tank is probably misleading - as you walk around you can get different views. It is two stories w/ elevators and stairs. Part of the aquarium is outside and there are petting pools and other activities for the kids. Although the aquarium is about fish, it really is all about educating people on our oceans and water. What have we done so far and how can we sustain these for future generations. The staff is made up of many volunteers (if we lived closer I would probably do this). There are booklets that you can get (has map as well as info on the fish) when you walk in. Also, you should look at the times and locations for feedings and presentations that are set up for the day so you can plan accordingly. These are very informative as well as fun to watch.There is a restaurant inside which actually is very good (I know most of the times these places are not). If you want, you can get your hand stamped (to come back in the same day) go out for a stroll along the boardwalk, watch some boats, sit in the park in the sun, have lunch at a restaurant or a picnic if you bought some food. Be sure to bring water bottles as the aquarium encourages refilling your water bottles by having filling stations all around.There are short movies that play on the wall and talk about our oceans (free) as well as short movies (small fee) that you can take the kids to. My favorite fish to see (but this changes constantly haha) - the sargasso see dragons (have to see it to believe them) or the little cowfish. Kids favorite - probably petting the rays & sharks (or the jellies).There also is a gift shop - so purchase some items and help support the cause. Most of all have fun and take care of our oceans.",jenLeCreate
50,bring your kids to share the wonders shown,a lot of hands on exhibits and demonstrations. The workers are mostly volunteers and love what they are doing. its hard to tell you about an aquarium or museum other then to say expect to spend 4 plus hours there. Fortunately there are food vendors on site and a lot of places to sit and eat.,tctommy
50,Fish for fun,Aquarium has lots of fun stuff for all kids of all ages.I love when the kids get to play with the little birds and get to pet the stingrays.The jellyfish exhibit is amazing as well,Karen L
40,Nice Aquarium and surroundings,Great hands on aquarium for kids and lots of interactive displays. Many other aquariums have more fish and other sea animals but still a great way to spend a half day. Surrounding area and promenade can fill in the rest of the day. Best to arrive early to beat the crowds.,RandallF16
50,One of the best ocean aquariums,"A very well thought out and educational aquarium. Hands on with sharks, rays, anemones, urchins, sea stars. The sea dragons were amazing as were the jelly fish....several different species...very knowledgeable and friendly staff. A great place to learn more about the ocean!",Kay932
50,Interactive exhibits for kids and interesting talks,"Came here on an unusual rainy day. Great aquarium with an impressive array of tanks. The kids loved the sea otters, seal and sea lion talks and the low pools where they could touch starfish, sea urchins etc as well as small sharks and rays. We got 15% off by booking via trusted tours and attractions, so good value.",snowbadger7
50,Loved this Aquarium!,"I took my 16 year old daughter and a friend to the Aquarium for the day and besides the fact that there were a million people there, I had a great time. Everything was immaculately clean and all animals well taken care of in an environment that appeared as close to natural as you could get. I loved the hands on activities because there is nothing better than getting to actually touch sea animals. Will go again.!",Robin M
30,what happened to all the fish,It seems like the aquarium is going through a change. What happened to all the fish? One area was closed. They still charged full price!,travelgirl562
50,Excellent,We really enjoyed our day here. There is lots to do and see and well worth the day. Many of the hotels provide discount coupons for the aqarium so don't pay full price.,SarahHiscock
50,Spring Break Outing with Grandson's,We were looking for something to do with the young boys and thought the aquarium and a whale watching day trip would be fun. It's been close to twenty years since I've been there so I didn't know what to expect. We found parking close by walked to their entrance to buy tickets. We were able to get aquarium and whale watching tickets at a discounted rate. The aquarium is very nice well maintained and well run. We were very pleased with our experience. Highly recommend visiting.,WMSCV
50,Excellent cultural programs,"Recently went to Latino night at the Aquarium of the Pacific. Music was great, performances entertaining and the outdoor area looks great in the early evening. No crowds which was a shame because it was a great event and free for members. Only complaint is that the indoor food vendor was disorganized and food was overpriced and bad. However the aquarium itself is wonderful and staff friendly and knowledgeable.",cniannessa2016
40,Great day out for kids and very educational,"This was our 4th or 5th visit to the Aquarium of the Pacific and it never disappoints. The most exciting thing for the youngsters is the amount of touchpools. My daughter was able to touch rays, small sharks, and a variety of tidepool creatures. She also loved the Lorikeets that perch on your arm to drink nectar from the small cups you can buy at the entrance. This is a very large aquarium with beautiful collections of sea life.",Jennifer G
40,Nice aquarium for all ages.,"The aquarium is clean and has many different displays, interactive areas and shows. The variety of jelly fish was amazing- they're so cool. It's a nice change of pace from the pace of most things in the LA area. Only downside was it's expensive. Plan on spending the day, bring a lunch and sit and look at the Queen Mary across the way.",HappyCampersNH
50,Childhood memories,As a child coming here was a must. So much to explore and you can actually touch some of the animals! The kids love it and the adults as well! There's always specials so look online if you like a bargain!,La_nanchiis
50,A Great place to visit,"My family member has yearly passes, went with them to see the aquarium, I was amazed by the huge aquarium inside. A great place to visit. If your looking for a place to take the family, or have kids, this is the place to visit. A great learning experience for all.",esethebomb
50,Love Birds,We are a bird loving family. We came to the Aquarium just to see and feed the Lorikeets. Sounds funny to say we saw birds at the Aquarium. LOL. For an extra $3 she can feed them nectar.,Marie F
50,Behind the Scenes Tour!,"Tip 1: Take the Behind the Scenes Tour! For the extra $20 you will get a more memorable experience than anything else you do that day. We met divers, fed fish, talked to a Volunteer rescuing coral, it was all amazing. And they are cool with you taking pictures.Tip 2: Bring your water bottle. There is a bottle filling/drinking fountain by the first floor restrooms and also by the learning center, on the way to the Lorikeets.Tip 3: They say No Outside Food, but they sure were not enforcing it the day I went.",Rob K
50,Very happy aquarium and the animals are friendly,"There were lots of captivating exhibits and the animals were happy to intereract with us and seemed active, and well taken care of by staff. My husband and I stayed inside for hours and that's pretty big for us, so I know it kept our interest😊We enjoyed learning about the aquarium, sea otters, Eel, and more!!!Worth the price for entry!",Muslimah S
50,Great visit with 4-year-old,"While visiting family in Long Beach, we spent a morning at the aquarium. We were lucky to get in with guest passes because of a family member with an annual pass, so I can't speak to the cost. As far as the aquarium itself, it was a great way to spend a morning with an inquisitive four year old. My daughter loved seeing all the different sea animals. There were plenty of touch tanks and it was a very kid-friendly place. We ate lunch at the Scuba Cafe but there are tons of restaurants in walking distance. With shopping, dining, and a super nice movie theater nearby, it's easy to spend a whole day in the immediate area. My advice is to get there when it opens though! When we arrived a little after 9:00 am, it was not crowded and perfect for walking around with a child. By midday it was swarming with school field trip groups. Overall, a very fun & educational experience!",Doodlebug_Cupcake
50,great for adults and kids,"The place is great!!! Its not an expensive as other attractions in the area, the kids love all the animals and fishes,even i learnt a few things, theres a lot of species, theres this king crab or the sea bass that look really cool, jellyfish are great too... a must! to visit.",yorchmorelia
50,Amazing visit,We visit the aquarium and bough a family membership so we can joy another extra discounts 👍👍👍 this is an amazing learning experience and all the employees are very helpfull the only inconvenience at the restaurant was the food. 😞 it takes more than 30 min. To be serve but it's a very good learning experience 👍👍👍👍 I LOVE ALL KIND THE JELLY FISHES 😍😍😍😍 This aquiarium is better than San Francisco & Monterrey I really recommended and I'll be back soon for sure 🐋🐳🐠🐟😍,gladys s
40,Pretty Nice Aquarium!,Have brought my kids out to this aquarium a handful of times! We always have fun and enjoy ourselves. Lots of cool things to see and do! Not too pricey either! Fun place to visit with family!,foxyroxyca2016
50,Graet Little Aquarium,"We were vacationing in Southern California and decided the cost to go to Sea World was out of our budget. I found the Aquarium of the Pacific on Trip Advisor and was not disappointed. My daughter found discount tickets on a social media site for 3PM till 6PM. his was plenty of time to see all the exhibits. Be advised however if you find a similar deal that most of the shows, feeding times, etc. end at 4PM. There is still plenty to see. The jellyfish exhibits and touch tanks were very well done. There were sharks and rays to touch as well as starfish, urchins, horseshoe crabs, etc. I could have spent all day watching the sea lions and sea otters in their exhibits. I would recommend this aquarium and will consider a return visit next time we are in the area,",nygf1
40,Aquarium of the Pacific,The aquarium of the Pacific is a nice place to take your family to see fish and sea life. There are schools with buses that are there so sometimes its best after 2pm to see the place with less of a crowd. You can pet baby sharks and rays there or watch them up close. There is sea life talks free to listen to and times to hear about them. There is beautiful fish to look at and different kinds of jelly fish to watch. There are seals and otters to watch. some of it is indoors and some outdoors. There is a lorikeet area where you can fed them weather permitting. A nice outing for a day. There is a charge for parking in a parking structure.,gardentogarden
50,A great aquarium to visit,We enjoyed our visit to this aquarium and exhibits were open for all to enjoy. The earthquake exhibit was fun and worth staying in line to experience it. This aquarium is definitely worth visiting.,kansas_traveler38815
50,Charter Member,"The aquarium is a nice building, clean and well kept. It houses fish from different parts of the Pacific Ocean. It also has mammals such as sea otters (my favorite) and seals. Don't miss the shark exhibit! I have visited the aquarium regularly since it opened. It has never failed to be worth the trip.",Z6965HJericl
50,This was neat,"We visited here after we left the Richard Nixon Library (which was under renovations) and it is worth the money. Very interesting displays and interactive things to do. Feed the lorikets, touch the sting rays. You could spend at least 4-5 hours here. We were here on March 15 and it didn't seem to busy, there were a lot of school groups there but they seemed to be very well organized",Cricket6886
30,Worth a look,"Not a giant aquarium by any means, save your money for Sea World in San Diego if that's what you're expecting. There are not a lot of colorful tropical fish, mostly local Pacific type fish which are drab. But If you do want to kill a couple hours, it's worth it just for the:1. Lorikeets. Buy some nectar for them and enjoy having them perch on your finger or head. Their colors are electrifyingly stunning.2. The petting tanks where you can touch sea stars, sharks, and rays.3. The shark tanks. Be sure to look for the barn-door sized giant stingrays. Jaw dropping!",LBGrandBanks
40,Not during spring break,"Would have loved to spend more time in this environment, but too crowded, hallways blocked with strollers, busy time, couldn't really see the exhibits.",royal642
40,Excellent mixture of live specimens and educational exhibits,"With convenient parking and a well-organized front office, the Aquarium of the Pacific is enjoyable and entertaining while remaining a worthwhile educational experience for people of most ages. It helps to be old enough to read and tall enough to see into the displays, many of which are live inside the bubble or glass enclosure. Also, a huge (life sized?) blue-whale-with-calf model is suspended from the ceiling. It is very impressive as it fills most of the center of the main hall. Supervised pools where you can touch sharks and rays while they swim past are a good way to get up-close-and-personal with sea life. There is a renovation/expansion in the works and that is likely to make this an even better experience. The only downer was that they do not allow outside food. The snack bars are OK, though, so not a big concern. Overall, we had a really good time and learned some interesting things doing it.",sheriff88
50,An amazing afternoon...especially for the kids,"Spent a few hours in the aquarium and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a bit confusing to navigate, but all of the displays were very interesting and very well maintained. The ""touching"" areas were a lot of fun, not for actually touching the rays or sharks, but in watching the young children do it...hilarious!!! The aviary was OK, but nothing special. The birds were very, very spoiled and if you didn't have a cup of nectar...they went on to the next group of people. Food prices were higher than outside, but not astronomical. Gift shop had many unusual gifts and once again, better than average prices for inside a tourist venue. Great stop for families and those who have never been to an aquarium before. Recommend this stop on your trip.",pklonn
50,Family visit,"Great place to visit, so much to see and learn. Children can touch the sea life and see the shows, they enjoy watching the animals.",snoymm
50,Interesting insights into the oceans and ocean life,Impressive exhibits and information displays. Can get crowded on weekends so go during the week if you can.,Russ M
50,Great Aquarium,"It is a great place for adults and children to spend the day. The best part of this aquarium is that you can touch Sea Rays, Sharks and Jellyfish. The Seals and Sea Lions show is cute.",Pauline2706
40,Nice aquarium,"While not as large as some like the Atlanta aquarium, this is a nice aquarium. There are many forms of sea life- both mammal and plant. Loved the baby shark petting pools. The jellyfish exhibits are really amazing, as well as all of the coral and kelp areas. There are many different dish throughout. The information sites are very well done too. Is is a great place to take children as well as adults.",blazer729
50,Something for everyone,"I love the aquarium of the pacific and have been a member for some time. With each gallery representing a different area of the pacific, there is immense diversity of species. They have many areas to touch animals- sharks, rays, sea stars, anemones, and moon jellies to name a few. The exhibits are constantly changing (last summer was the summer of jellies), and whether you are in the mood for an otter show, a meet-and-greet with a cockatoo, or you just want to sit and watch the fish swim serenely in one of the huge exhibits (blue cavern and tropical reef especially!), there is something for everyone here. Especially interested patrons can check out displays on climate change, view the art exhibited throughout the great hall, or catch a show in the theater. They are expanding in the next few years and I can't wait!",Danielle G
50,Terrific Aquarium,One of the best Aquariums we've visited. Many displays and shows including interactive ones including tanks where children can stroke sharks and rays. The enthusiasm and helpfulness of the many volunteers was really impressive. The Aquarium has a program where adult volunteers can bring children to help them and learn how to be volunteers here.,jakobj
50,Aquarium visit,It's a great learning experience for school aged children. I took my grand babies they loved the all of the different fish and most of all the hands on experience.,Tonya R
40,Aquarium of the World is more like it. This place is huge.,"Give yourself a full day of checking this place out. See a couple shows, pet the rays, wave to the sea lions. Lots to do there, so dont short yourself by getting there mid afternoon.",saul s
50,Great for the under 8 age grouo,This is no seaworld. But I have 2 young kids ages 5 and 3 and eventhough we have visited the aquarium a few times already - they still have tons of fun each time. This is a great half day learning activity for them. Best when its not crowded because it is small....so weekdays is best time to go. Theres plenty of interactive areas where they get to touch the sea creatures/rays/little sharks and that seems to be their favorite.,CaliAngel
50,A real aquarium without the roller coaster,We visited the Aquarium of the Pacific with our three grandchildren ages three to eight. The we all found it interesting scientifically. The grandchildren loved the touch pools where they could stroke rays and other fish. I highly recommend it.,rhw23
20,Not that impressed,This aquarium is fairly small as one would think by the name it would be larger. I went with my friend and her kid and we saw everything in like 2 hours or less. Food and souvenirs were pricy. I don't think I'd have a need to go back. I'd suggest planning other activities in the area in addition to this if going to check it out. There are other things around that can also be done in the same day to make the trip worth it. The area around the aquarium is very nice.,alison f
40,Great for the little ones.,The aquarium is very clean and kept up really nice. They have great displays of all the fish and even a Jelly fish exhibit where they let you touch the jelly fish! Kids would really love the experience. Only down side is it is a little expensive.,Pamela B
50,A Plethora of Marine Life!,"When in Long Beach, California, stop by and see all the great stuff at The Aquarium of the Pacific. It's especially great for school age children. The exhibits are interactive and clean! It's fun to see the guys in scuba gear swimming around, cleaning the glass - they are super friendly and point different marine life out to you. Of course, you can't hear what they are saying, but the adults get it and then relay it to the kids. On the third floor, they have cool diving bird exhibits and a pool where you can actually pet the baby stingrays. There is a person who sits in the center of that pool and gives you all kinds of really cool tips on the stingrays. Totally interesting! Don't forget to visit the gift shop during your visit - they have something for everyone. My personal favorites are the seals and sea lions. Their faces and their little whiskers are super cute. Make sure to stop by and say HI!",Yesship
40,Really Nice Aquarium,"Loved this, it was fun, educational and clean. I felt the sea life and animals where well cared for. The birds where a must see. Loved this and will go back for sure",tessalovestravel
50,The jewel of Long Beach,"We were lucky enough to spend a day here and were extremely impressed with the variety of marine life to see and experience. There are several touch tanks, several galleries representing different parts of the Pacific, the chance to feed Lorikeets and get up close and personal with them, a large variety of jelly fish, lots of presentations with divers in different tanks, educational 3/4D films, and oh so much more. We were impressed with the knowledge and dedication of the volunteer staff and the care given to animals and maintaining their habitats. There were so many ways to excite and involve the children in their learning, but us adults got just as much as the kids out of all of it. I strongly recommend a visit here.",tadec5
30,Lots of Fishies,"Well since we live nearby we figured we might as well check this place out.Very crowded. Lots of kids. Good for them, they need to learn what fish are I suppose.We'd have to be really impressed to want to return to a place that had crowds like this. Suffice it to say once is enough.If you have young kids I'm sure they'll love this place.I did enjoy watching the jellyfish.If you park here I can only assume you had to pay at the parking garage like we did.",Mark B
50,Great fun,"I took a friend who needed a wheelchair to get around. All the exhibits were easily navigated. Yes there are a lot of kids there, that's why we arrived at 2 as most of them were leaving. Make sure you see the sea lions and sea otters. Both have feedings and well worth hanging around for.",BobPhibbs
50,Fun for the whole family,I love fish so this was a perfect place for me. The tanks are great and the fish variety is fantastic. I would recommend going in the winter to see everything up close since they do get crowds in the summer.,lroll
40,Great aquarium,Great experience! My 14 year old daughter loved it and the jellyfish were awesome! Lived being able to touch thd sharks at the exhibit.,Tammi N
50,Aquarium of the Pacific Visit Behind the Scene Tour,This is the second time that we have toured the aquarium. The Behind the Scenes Tour is recommended to any visitor. The tour has an age requirement due to the areas visited are restricted. Informative the tour allows the visitor to visit and gain a better perspective on the care of the sea life at the aquarium.The general exhibits are excellent for all ages. Clean well maintained. Excellent facility.Will visit again!,Sandy W
40,Good for Kids,"The hands on experience is a great way learn about the sea life. My 9 year old loved the touch pools with rays, sharks, and other sea life. Good Value, kind of small only took us about 3 hours to tour the entire facility before we saw everything.",MrsVlaming
40,Very interactive fun aquarium.,"I have been to several aquariums including the one here in Baltimore. For families, this can be a fun day trip to Long Beach as the aquarium is very interactive with touching exhibits. There is a lot to see including some weird marine creatures that will make you turn your head. There is no whales or dolphins, but in Cali you can see those in the Pacific on a boat tour.Beware that on a nice peak season, this aquarium will be packed! Making it difficult to take pictures of see the exhibits. There will be a lot of kids banging on the tanks and scaring the marine life away. Too many saltwater fish tanks you can see at a pet store. The shark tank could have been built better (Like the one in Baltimore) but the pelicans outside stole my heart. They were up and close for a picture.A nice family fun day this is a place to go. make sure you reserve a restaurant nearby or you will have to wait an hour.",moking89
50,Well worth the trip and money,"Enjoyed a morning at the aquarium. It was very busy. They were having a special event. We did not know in advance but expect Saturdays are busy all the time. The displays were very interesting. It was amazingly clean. Staff are very knowledgeable and helpful. Take your kids, take your grandma. Everyone will enjoy their visit.",nippon703
50,A Perfect Afternoon,"This aquarium is not big but it's just perfect for a half day or afternoon trip. I just loved how the exhibits are interactive and the great variety of sea creatures. Another plus is the food they serve is very good! I specially noticed all the handicap accomodations & the many toys children had to play with in the outside courtyard. So, simply put a perfect afternoon :)",Alejandra E
50,Interesting displays and worth the time to visit,We had a few hours on Sunday morning and were rewarded by a brief visit to the aquarium. Great displays and very educational.,Travel_bug0707
50,Great place to take the kids and learn something along the way,Been here lots of times with the kids after getting an annual pass. It can get busy but there is lots to see and do to occupy a couple hours despite the crowds. The displays are thoughtfully laid out and provide a good level of education and interest so that both the kids and the adults will be interested. A definite must do if you are in the Long Beach area.,DaQi
50,Fabulous,"It is much greater than shows. I could not believe it!In a nice place, there is a complete package of sea life!Jellyfish and Reef are fantastic!!!Sea Lion Show was incredible!!!!Beautiful Sharks!Friendly Birds' place, allow you to feed them.You are going to need more than 2 hours(believe me!)Try to get there on week days, before arriving the school teams.",hosnegar
50,Jellies you can touch!,I love this aquarium. There is a giant tank filled with beautiful fish and sea plants that you can sit and watch for a while. There are also these really cool fish that glow in the dark. I love the interactions where you can touch the jellyfish and other sea creatures. Definitely a fun place to spend a weekend,Samanthatravels11
40,Absolutely fintastic!,Huge variety of fish and well organized. The jelly fish were the best part although it's hard to beat the tropical fish. I have been there before and it was just as good this time as last.,OT1Kanobi
30,Kinda Neat But Expensive,Not sure it was worth the admission fee. We went on a Saturday afternoon so it ended up being really busy. Did not plan that well on our part. Some of the exhibits were hard to see as their were too many people.,mphall2013
40,Jellies and Friends,"We had been given tickets to the Aquarium, so glad we used them. The Jellyfish exhibits were amazing. Saw fish I had never seen before, i.e. Sea Dragons were awesome. It was crowded, lots of people with strollers, families. I would probably go back on a week day to avoid the crowds. Great gift shop.",Karen121
50,Much larger than it looks.,This place allows for the entire family to view those creatures of the sea that only national geographic divers get to see.,blaqsuperman
40,Great venue,We had a business dinner at the aquarium. Wow. I wish I could have seen outside! The exhibits inside were beautiful and interesting. The octopus was a little creepy and the sea otters entertaining. Nice place to visit.,Tim B
30,Average Aquarium,"When this aquarium first opened, I remember attending a school field trip to it and feeling underwhelmed. I attributed it to the fact that it had only opened months prior and so I went as an adult 10 years later thinking that it must have improved. Well there were improvements and more sea life to see but it's pretty small and the variety of creatures left much to be desired. This is very much a family activity because if you aren't with kids, you can walk through the whole aquarium very quickly and then wonder why you spent so much on an entry ticket and parking. I would expect more from an aquarium that is literally right next to the Pacific.",Tamara V
30,under the sea,"I liked the different exhibits but felt the layout was awkward. If you went in a specific direction on the 2nd level and didnt backtrack, you would miss the jelly fish, or the sea otters. The information about the animals were dumbed down, so anyone can understand what they were looking at. The puffins were cute, as they were bobbing up and down in their tank. Overall, it was a relaxing day to just walk around at the Aquarium of the Pacific.",Yves
50,School field trip,Beautiful place enjoyed my day with my son and his classmates from the hillcrest elementary at the aquarium .I will come back definetly,BARCENAS1980
50,STAFF WERE AMAZING!!,Princess Cruises made a mess of our transfers after the cruise so my little boy and I needed to figure out what to do for many hours before getting back to the air port LAX. After a very expensive cab ride as the local transit does not like people with a back pack as the bus drove right past us!! and the shuttles next to the Princess Cruises port are worse of a rip off. GO UBER.. make sure you have the app!!. Back to Aquarium... they stored our back packs and we had a great time. The shuttle that we did order came early and left. The staff called them and got them back!! The aquarium is small but wonderful for a couple hours!! Great work staff... your effort was amazing!!,FamilyEdmontonActivi
40,We touched SEA LIFE!,"The aquarium is a great place to visit, especially for those who do not have access to a great aquarium in their home city. There is a lot to see, live demonstrations, sea life you can touch, birds you can feed, and movies to see. The aquarium can get hot outside, so plan for sunscreen, a hat, and water. There were plenty of employees on hand to answer questions and help us. We booked a double pass that was offered for the aquarium and the Queen Mary. It was a great deal if you like to pack two great sites into one day. It's totally doable.",6Liddells
50,Wonderful experience...,"I enjoyed this aquarium. Much to see, inside and out. A large variety of marine life in a huge space. A lot of fun in a gorgeous scenic area.The location is beautiful. There are picnic areas and walking decks, restaurants and shopping. Long Beach is gorgeous. This spot was AMAZING!",Brownie61
50,Always enjoyable!,"We spent the better part of the day here and thoroughly enjoyed all the exhibits and shows. What struck me was the cleanliness of the entire place. The sea lion and seal show was fun to watch. All the employees are very well trained and can answer nearly every question asked of them. Moreover, they seem to enjoy their jobs which adds to it. The jellyfish exhibits are amazing, the various aquariums have a wide variety of different fish, wildlife, and the accompanying written explanations are helpful. You can also download a free app that will give you a map, a schedule of all the shows, and a layout of the whole aquarium. We had lunch at the Scuba Café which was surprisingly very good and reasonable to boot! The highlight was at the very end when we stumbled upon an interactive show of the globe of the world with various charts and graphs that were overlaid showing El Nino patterns, currents, the formation of the earth from over 400 million years ago to 100 million years in the future. The docent was very excited about what he was telling us and made it all that more interesting. It was on the first floor right after the gift shop and I would highly recommend taking it all in. The only down side was the number of strollers and young kids who were not well behaved, pushing in front of us, yelling, tapping on the glass of the exhibits which clearly asked you not to do that, and stepping all over us. But I can't blame the Aquarium for that - we truly enjoyed our day!",icyvelvet
50,Visiting our Sea Creatures,"This was just a stop for our trip to help kill time before our dinner. Loved the animals! The workers there were so friendly, too! I loved how they had sessions to briefly explain the animals lifestyles and to inform everyone about awareness of these sea creatures. My favorite part was being able to walk into a HUGE bird sanctuary where you could get up close to a handful of birds.This is a great place that isn't too impacted with people for children to attend. There is a bunch of information that is great for any youngster to learn! I even learned new things, being an adult! Bring your family! You'll have a nice time visiting for a few hours.",andaum90
50,Favorite Aquarium,"This is my family's favorite aquarium, it is a great location and there is so much to do with family or friends. NICE PEOPLE!!",Darian C
40,Smaller than I expected.,Quite pricey for what it was. Absolutely teaming with school children on educational visits - fabulous for them as very very hands on.,Dinah B
40,Fun way to spend the day.,This is a nice aquarium in a nice location. There are a lot of things to do with little kids. Parking is close and there is a nice cafe upstairs that serves lunch and beer.,Laura H
40,Fun afternoon!,"I was an original member when the aquarium first opened as our son was still in elementary school so we went every month. It is a great place for families with kids but also a great date place. They hold different events during the year to keep it interesting and a reason to at least make an annual visit if you live locally.I will be honest, I have been to several much better aquariums in California (Monterey Aquarium for one) and out of state - I was disappointed with our first visit but we still took our son regularly because he enjoyed it so much. It is still nice to have this in Long Beach and kids will ALWAYS have fun which means it will be a good time for parents as well.",Leslie
40,took the kids to aquarium,"Decided to take the kids spur of the moment, place is very informative and lots to see, tickets are a little pricey but at least they sell beer! Good interactive fun for kids",Alex C
40,Great Place To Go...,"It is a fantastic place to go, but either early morning or when school is in session. It gets very crowded in the summer time and on school holidays. It is a little slice of Long Beach that is making a huge splash!!!It is a little pricy for what is has to offer. Check online for nights when prices go down or when something special is happening.",andrea l
30,AQUARIUM,"Nice, not a large facility. On the high side of entrance fee. Presentation I thought could be better. Overall nice. Would I go back? NO!",DIVESHACKUSA
40,Fun place to take the kids,I took the kids even though one of them didn't want to go. But he was really happy he did afterwards. Definitely a place to go while you are here.,Barrett M
40,The best in the area,"A great way to spend the afternoon! Great for the kids. Educational and informative. Could be a little less pricey.Wine sales a plus. Very interactive. The lower viewing area or tube where the sea life swims over you, always smells like piss.This is especially true on humid days.",Able
40,Fun!,"Myself and my boyfriend went to the aquarium and it was so much fun. To get out of the heat for a while and do something really interesting and fun it's a must. Loads to see, loads of interactive games and very helpful staff I found it brilliant !",Rachael Louise M
40,Nice Attraction,"We visited the aquarium on a gorgeous sunny day at the start of the February.The visit was really enjoyable and it was really nice to be able to interact with some of the animals whether it be petting sharks, string rays, jellyfish, starfish or birds.Whilst the ticket price was slightly expensive it was still good value for money.",BusTravBHD
50,Wonderful day visit,Do the behind the scenes visit and the whale watching trip to make a really full day. This is a beautiful building and a beautiful location.,everythingceltic
50,World class and great for all ages.,"In addition to the huge displays, they also have rotating exhibits to fascinate visitors of all ages.They employ many local docents to make visits informative and educational including several ""touch tanks"" that children really enjoy.This is one of Long Beach's finest assets.",Steve S
50,"Wish we had more time here, it the only complaint!","Our trip to the aquarium was a last minute decision and we regret not having spent more time there. There is just so much to see, and the presentation is impeccable, they say it is the best aquarium in the world and I would believe it. The colours of the fish and the lighting in the corridors gave a really alluring atmosphere. I loved the little jelly fish like creatures, with the thin wavering threads. There were also some pretty big fish to see as well. Highly recommended for a days outing.",Helen H
50,Best day in Long Beach,Got to see the divers feed the fish and they waved to the kids. Makes it very special. Tanks seemed very clean and we were happy to explore it all. Best to go early or late afternoon. Busy during school days with field trips.,lanzie99
30,Unusual species to see,"This is not a huge aquarium but it is worth the visit (even if it is a bit expensive), mainly because of some not usual species to see like the sea dragons. Jellies are an interesting show. There are some other cool attractions like night dive, but for those you need to schedule in advance. Try the sea ray and scratch their back while they are passing by. Children I saw where having a great time doing so.",Marcelo
50,A Very Positive Learning Experience,"I always enjoy learning more about sea creatures, and this aquarium is the perfect place to learn more about them.",Rosita T
40,Great aquarium,I went here Memorial day weekend. Really fun aquarium with lots of exhibits to see. We also went on a boat tour and learned about the local wildlife. The guides were excellent and knew a lot of information. The location is beautiful. I would go again if I'm back in the area.,Heather R
50,An Aquarium geared for children and equal fun for adults.,"From the scuba divers feeding the fish and educating the audience, to the various exhibits which mimic the venue, this is a lifetime experience.If you are any place near Long Beach this is a must.",Jefftimb
50,Aquarium of the pacific,If u r looking for a quick family outing with your kids it's a fun place to go. The kids will love looking at sea life especially the sea otters. And touching the stingrays were fun for the kids as well. Afterward you can eat at the restaurants and the pike and enjoy the shopping across the street.,Paula L
40,Very Fun,"Grand kids loved going, lots to see, but not enough places for Grandma to sit and rest. The food was expensive and not that great. Parking was a bit of a walk for me as I am disabled. Mornings are the best as it is not as crowded, by afternoon it was packed and no place to sit down.",Susan B
40,Very interesting aquarium,I visited the aquarium as part of a company event so there were limited areas to visit. The areas I was able to visit were very interesting. I particularly liked the hands-on station where I was encouraged to touch some star fish and other creatures! The volunteer student was both engaging and informative. I will definitely go back to see the entire aquarium!,cherylp701
50,Fun Time With Grandson,"The aquarium is very child friendly thus lots of kids elementary school age and down. Our grandson is 2 1/2 and other than having to chase a little one, we could have not found a better place to take him. While they have wonderful interactive and touch exhibits he was not sure about sticking his hands in with all those fish. His favorite parts were the aviary, the puppet show and the ocean themed water play area. Nothing having a wet child. We are looking forward to a return trip.",GAM
50,Great Aquarium,I have been here a few times and I love it! The staff is nice and they have lots of cool fish to see and interact with.,Kara L
50,Innovative and interesting,"Allow a minimum of 2 hours and more if with children. validated parking across the road with enough time to really get to see everything. The displays are colourful, well engineered, easy to view and offer a broad variety of marine creatures native to the Pacific coast. Admission is reasonable ,given the size and variety of exhibits and shows and a person could just stand and watch for hours if so inclined. We did the tour on a week day evening when crowds were non existent and did it in a leisurely 2.5 hours. I would go again next time we are in L A.",fishingdavep
50,Not to be missed when you're in the LA area,"The aquarium in Long Beach is a world-class facility, spacious and well designed. Tickets were $29 but compared to other aquariums around the country the price was comparable. Exhibits explore the waters of Southern California and Baja, the Northern Pacific, and the Tropical Pacific. In addition to the three main galleries, the Aquarium features some outstanding outdoor exhibits. Shark Lagoon allows visitors to reach into the water to pet the sharks as they swim around the shallow pool. There is a Penguin Habitat and a small seating area allows visitors to watch scheduled sea lion performances. Our favorite though was the Lorikeet Forest where we purchased small cups of a milky colored liquid. Upon entering the bird enclosure, it takes no time at all for the birds to find you. We held out our arms and the birds immediately jump on and find the cup of food. It's a delight to interact so closely with these brightly colored birds.Back indoors we saw otters, turtles, frogs, an octopus, and all sorts of beautiful, ugly, and intriguing underwater creatures, many I have never seen before. The first thing that I took notice of was the glass used in the exhibits. The glass was so crystal clear you couldn't tell it was there unless you touched it. The water inside the tanks was also sparkling clean and so well lit that it gave the displays a magical effect. We spent the entire afternoon here, moving from one exhibit to another, until closing time.Meals at these attractions is always a bad idea. The food is typical tourist fare that is always expensive. The cafes are always crowded and noisy. While the food here was good it was still typical tourist burgers and pizza and it was pricey. With so many good restaurants surrounding this aquarium within walking distance, it would make sense to eat at one of them before entering the aquarium.The aquarium is two levels but elevators make it easy for those who can't take the stairs.There is a free shuttle bus that stops at the aquarium which will transport you all around the city of Long Beach.Also, right outside the aquarium's door is a shopping area with shops and restaurants.",delily
50,"Great exhibits, small enough to see everything easily","The current featured exhibit is jelly fish. You are sure to be fascinated by the variety and beauty of these ethereal creatures. The aquarium is small enough that you can see everything without staying all day long. Two hours would be your minimum stay to feel you've gotten your money's worth. If you want to see the films or presentations, that will take longer. I have been a charter member since the aquarium opened, and have enjoyed visiting there many times with friends, family, and out of town guests. They validate parking in their structure for $8, then you can stroll the area, dine, shop, and even take in a movie across the street.",AmeliaAirheart
40,Crowded and a bit small but has some impressive exhibits,"We went to the Aquarium on a Saturday in January. It was packed! We moved through the exhibits much more quickly because we were constantly being jostled along. I think you could take more time to enjoy each exhibit if you went on a less busy day.The otters were so fun and swam right alongside the glass. Children loved watching these furry creatures. The jellyfish tanks were also quite fascinating. Divers explored the biggest exhibit, which helped give us a better perspective of the size of the fish. Outside exhibits included ponds where guests can touch rays, sharks, and starfish.Overall, it is a nice, educational experience that takes about two hours to walk through. I thought it was a bit expensive for only two hours worth of enjoyment. Again, perhaps we would have spent longer in the Aquarium if it wasn't so crowded. I'd recommend visiting on a weekday, so you can take your time and get the most out of your visit.Side note, there is a parking garage right across the street. Parking is about $8 with Aquarium validation. Stop by the front desk inside the Aquarium to validate your parking. There are a lot of restaurants within walking distance.",TT_ND
50,Great attraction!,"We have season memberships so try to go often. We have been taking our small grandchildren and they love it. They get to run around, pet the rays and sharks, feed the lorikeets and play on the sealife statues. Whenever we have guests visiting Long Beach,we try to take them for a visit as we are very proud of this aquarium.",Diane A
40,Good quality experience,"Had an enjoyable day visit. Well done exhibits, with lots of variety. I am however glad I didn't have to pay full price, as my hotel bellman had a coupon for almost half off!",JudyfromBoise
40,An Enjoyable Visit,"It was a rainy, windy day; we were looking for an indoor activity. The Aquarium of the Pacific provided just what we needed. There are a variety of themed exhibits that provide insight to Aqua-ecosystems. As you might expect for a rainy Sunday afternoon, the aquarium was fairly crowded. In spite of that it was reasonably easy to see most of the exhibits.Everyone will have their favorites - I liked the jellyfish and sea dragons. Amazing.There is an indoor parking lot across the street. Parking cost $8.00 with validation at the aquarium.We had an enjoyable visit.",Aaron H
50,High quality aquarium,"This is a beautiful facility with docents available to answer questions, adequate room for the animals and immaculately kept. Additionally, there is a whale watching boat in the adjacent harbor that has Aquarium docents on it to help riders understand what they are seeing. All in all it's not only enjoyable but very educational as well. Highly recommended.",thizizliz
40,See the sea creatures of the world in one visit,"Enjoyed our visit to the aquarium. Unfortunately some of the jellyfish exhibits were closed for maintenance but the variety of sea animals was incredible. Especially enjoyed the tropical fish and the amazing, huge tanks. Lots of chances to look and touch in the various touch tanks and the seals and otters were very cool too.",jerjon
50,Great place for kids,Our kids had great fun. You can touch a lot of different animals. I highly recommend it. You can spend a whole day there. Just bring an extra change of clothe for your child as they a have a little spray park and the kids are likely to get wet. We had more fun there than at Disneyland.,Roxana N
50,Sea creatures,I was at the attraction last Nov .My hubby and I our 2 granddaughters and daughterinlaw.My experience was fabulous.This Aquarium has it all .Love the hands on for the kids .Touch jellyfish ...touch sharks .....Lots of places to sit .....Great place to eat and lots of souvenirs.Having so many children visiting it can get noisey....😁I would return all the time .My family has a family pass for the year They also have senior s rates.Parking is plenty in a 5 story building...

30,Very nice but not cheap,"My kids had fun visiting this aquarium. It had some hands-on exhibits. If you happen to be in Long Beach, I would recommend a visit but don't go out of your way.",bamboo222SanDiego_CA
40,Family overnight sleep in,"I commend the board of directors, executive director and staff for coming up with this idea. It is wonderful pulled off by the staff and educators and my children and I had a fabulous time. The staff keeps the evening well paced and makes sure the children have a great time. The facility has so many hands on activities and the staff engaging with you and your kids. Do not miss the coral and make sure you pet a shark while you are there. Truly, you can pet a shark.",DobsonWilsonFamily

50,Big and Beautiful,"Went with family to the Aquarium. We happen to go on a day that Senior Citizens were free. I'm a Senior Citizen, so there ;) Paid parking is across the street and a short walk to the Aquarium. Enjoyed the walk thru sea life tanks. All types of species, Sharks to Jellyfish. There are indoor exhibits and outdoor exhibits. We just happen to be there the time they displayed the new baby penguins. I have photos. Can't find them. A must go if in the Longbeach area.",HavBagWiLLTravel
50,Excellent aquarium,"Does not look like much from the outside, and the map does not do justice to the exhibits. Once inside, the aquarium is magnificent. The exhibits are wonderful. From Leafy Sea Dragons, jellyfish, tropicals, local fish etc. Definitely a must see. Staff are helpful. Even the snack bar on the second floor is nice with good sandwiches and salads. A pleasant surprise. Can also get a combo ticket for the Queen Mary.Hint: Park at the Aquarium, see that, then take the shuttle to the Queen Mary and save $20 parking at QM.",dinerdon
50,Excellent aquarium,I went to the Aquarium of the Pacific and had a great time. The animals are well cared for and husbandry is clearly a priority. The exhibits are all clean and beautiful and there is a great diversity of marine animals here. I loved it and would go again. I recommend this aquarium highly.,Andrew G
50,Great Aquariam,The Sea Lion show and the Sea Otter shows are very good. All the tanks are simply Specatular There is a very large staff to explain everything.,Jgoldchain
30,"A bit overpriced, but fun","Loved the huge whale in the lobby! We got to interact with a lot of marine life, petting jelly fish and sting rays and starfish... we even got to check out the illusive octopus. Lots of fun, but kind of overpriced for the experience.",Kris R
50,Excellent Aquarium,"Had a chance to visit this aquarium as part of a cruise ship tour. This was one of the nicest aquariums we have visited in our travels. Although we were a retired couple and enjoyed the tanks, displays, and shows, this aquarium is awesome for kids. Mane interactive tanks and support staff make this a great day out for families with young children. The marine life of the Pacific region are well represented and displayed. The tanks and other displays were pristine and the fish and other marine life were well cared for. We had lunch in the cafe and the food was fresh and tasty. Eating on the outside terrace was very nice.",travelinman018
40,Wonderful place to spend an afternoon.,We spent the afternoon enjoying the exhibits. There is lots to see and very child friendly.Lunch was rather chaotic with confusion on where to line up to order different types of menu items.,Deborahk8992
50,HAD A GREAT TIME,Very impressive collection of marine life and the displays are well done.. The touch pool is a great experience and the member benefits convinced us to join up,SenorGancho
50,Kids Heaven at the Aquarium,"We took our two granddaughters (7 & 10) to the Aquarium 1/17/2016, they loved it, Seal Lion Show, Petting the Baby Sharks and Feeding the Birds. Great fish tanks indoors very educational. Definitely recommend.",Paul S
40,Fun few hours,"If you are looking for a family activity in the Downtown Long Beach area, this is a great spot. It will take anywhere from two to three hours to see everything so it's not a full day event. The aquarium flows well with plenty for kids to see. They have sharks, sea lions, plenty of fish, and most importantly, plenty of hands on exhibitions. Look for discounts on Groupon or other sites like Goldstar to avoid paying full price admission. If you want to make a day out of it, there are hour long harbor cruises nearby and plenty of restaurants within walking distance. My kids enjoy going to Bubba Gumps after the aquarium. This is a safe area of Long Beach so don't let any idea of Long Beach being a ghetto hinder you from visiting.",Jose A
30,Lots of interesting aquatic and marine life here,We went on the weekend. It was very crowded and noisy. It was difficult to see some of the attractions such as the otter show. There was a nice display of marine life. They had many engaging opportunities that were hands on for the kids. A nice scientific explanation of El Nino,Kim K
20,Not the best,"Very underwhelming, and wasn't the best outing I've had. I didn't learn much about why the fish where kept in captivity which was something I really wanted to learn about.",Beth Thomas

50,Dream-come-true Aquarium,"A must see when visiting Los Angeles. Great tanks, Clear description of sea life and a lot of other written information. Wonderful variety of sharks. My personal favorite tanks were the various jellyfish tanks. Chapeau!For $300 you can dive in one of the tanks if you are certified. The price includes the dive and other material goodies. I was disappointed that we didn't have time and were not prepared to do this. Perhaps on my next visit.",CraneMountain
50,Great Family Activity!,Very educational about marine life. My nephew absolutely love this place! This is a great family activity. Lots of parking and plenty to do and places to eat after you are done with touring the Aquarium.,soko y
50,Spend the whole day,Get there early and avoid the long lines and make sure you go to all the exhibits and into the movie theater.The lorikeet walk-through aviary is wonderful -get the nectar and the lorikeets will come and sit on your hand or shoulder and eat from you they will also be very interested in any buttons and zippers on your clothes. They will not hurt you.This is a great attraction for a kids because they have the tanks or you can touch things and they have the small sharks in the exhibit tank also to touch.Parking is available in the structureCheck for discounts online before you go,swimdiva
40,Very cool! Lots of interactive stations.,"This aquarium is pretty neat but not the largest. It took about 2-3 hours to get everything out of this place so certainly not an all-day activity. They had animals both in-doors and out. Small sea life as well as sharks, penguins and also an aviary which was unexpected. The restaurant upstairs is average. Overall, worth a stop. Great for kids and adults alike.",Erin
50,"Sea Lions and Seals, Jellyfish, Lorikeets, and More!","This is a wonderful, modern, educational, interesting, and engaging aquarium for all ages. My elementary aged kids love this aquarium. On our most recent visit we made several trips through the enclosure with the Lorikeets (like parrots that like to land on you as they feed from a thimbleful of $3 nectar). We also especially like to watch for the two turtles when we walk through the glass tunnel and watch the fish swimming all around us. What an enchanted wonderland! There are a number of good restaurants in the vicinity and we have also eaten at the cafeteria in the aquarium.",LovingNewAdventures
40,So many fish!,The last time I went we saw a bunch of cool new exhibits. I love the way the seals play and interact with you through the glass.,Moxie_Grrl
50,DESERVINGLY NUMBER ONE!,"This superb aquarium is well worth a couple of hours time. When paying admission for two with tax, one senior as well as the eight dollar parking, total was $64 and I handed over my credit card. Throughout this area they wish to see picture id! By happenstance I showed the young lady my Armed Forces retiree id and pleasantly she announced that would save us money and price dropped to 58. Do not miss the second floor. Right now there is a wide variety of jelly fish on display. Never before have I seen such a fascinating display as their deceased pygmy sperm whale, showing the benefits of its inevitable deterioration on the seabed to the community of crabs, fishes and other sea creatures too. We loved it, nice store too.",flyboy1320
50,Impressive!,We took our grown children and we all enjoyed our time. There is a nice variety of ocean life and some are spectacular. We also enjoyed the otter and sea lion shows while there. I highly recommend visiting the aquarium. Discount tickets can be found at various places online.,AnnetteFres
50,A fun addition to our vacation,"We were in town for the rose parade and having extra time, decided to go to the aquarium. The exhibits were great and we enjoyed several of the talks.

50,Beautiful fish and birds,"Enjoyed our short time here. Missed the shows, arrive early to the location of show to guarantee a seat ( seals and sea lions). The tropical fish were amazing and the jellies cool to watch for both kids and adults alike.

Friendly staff.",Linda M
40,Quite a sampling if marine life,The aquarium is very nice with many beautiful creatures. The ability to touch the sharks was a highlight.,15th
30,Interesting place,This is a cool place to visit. There are two floors of exhibits. You will get to pet Jellyfish and Sharks. There are all kinds of colorful fish. There is a two story tank that divers go in and do educational shows. This is a great place to bring younger kids.,Korndog Izard
50,"Penguins, otters and sharks... Oh my!",The Aquarium of the Pacific is amazing. The exhibits are great. 19 Major Habitats and 32 Focus Exhibits are featured.It's fun to walk through the aquarium and share it with others. Everyone is smiling.Take the Behind the Scenes tour. You learn interesting facts about the fish and what it takes to manage the aquarium.,gmeredith

50,How it has grown,"The last time here around 2001 when the grand kids were young. It was so-so then we thought ! For my wife birthday this one thing she wanted to do will still in CA. We stayed for over 4+ hours, we really only left because our feet got tired.The exhibits in the small tanks were really interesting from all over the different oceans of the world. They had fish & explanation of the So. Calif Coast. I learned a lot about thing I did not know even having sailed up & down the Pacific mexico to Hawaii for 50 yrs.The water in 98% of the large & small tanks were so crystal clear it looked like you could drink the water. We have seen many Aquarium tanks around the world & this water was unbelievable clear.There is something here for all ages. Try & come in the middle of the week !! Plan to stay awahile the cost is high but worth it !!",RANCHET

50,Nice Time,Had a 5 year old and a 3 year old child with 6 adults on a visit to the Aquarium. Very nice visit. The area is well layed out so we didn't feel to crowded.

40,pretty Jellies!,"Had a day before the cruise ship left. It is near the terminal and we booked tickets online to save a few bucks. On an Early Saturday morning, opened at 9 am and the kids had not completely invaded so we were able to walk around and see stuff unimpeded. They had some interesting exhibits with the Jellies playing music(u need to see it) and seal and sea lions doing ""tricks:' Lots of things for kids 6-14 to do. All in all a good way to blow off a few hours before the cruise.",SpearsTx
40,Loved the interaction!!,"Being from the Gulf region, it was nice to see the different marine life that is in the Pacific. I was most impressed with the jelly fish. They are simply amazing.

40,Aquarium in Long Beach Ca.,"Hi, It has been a few yrs since I visited the aquarium in Long Beach. Took my father and sister there. It was quite a busy day when we went, lots of kids. But kids can be fun to watch, the joy and wonder on their faces and squeals of excitement.This is a beautiful exhibit with high ceilings and lots to ""sea"". If you have never beento an aquarium it is a truly wonderful exhibit. Bit pricey but they do a lot for the sea lifeand it is not something you do often unless you work there.The wonderful seahorses and starfish, the many types of jellies, underwater living spaces for the fish and many types are something to take your time and really enjoy.The surrounding area includes the Queen Mary ship that even from a distance is apleasure to enjoy. Nice area to walk and places to eat.Wow, writing this has me interested in going there again myself!",sabelsart
20,Just ok...,"I was very excited to visit the aquarium! I am originally from Florida so my expectations might be a little too lofty... But I was not impressed. The crew was very nice and helpful, but the exhibits are quite small and cramped. If it is even remotely busy you have to fight to see even an inch of the exhibit. I couldn't help feel bad for the cramped quarters of the sea lions and sharks. It may be ok for kids but make sure you go when school isn't out or you won't be able to see a thing!",mk2223
40,Nice change of pace,"The Aquarium of the Pacific is located on the Harbor in Long Beach very close to the Queen Mary and The Pike. It's right across the street from the Long Beach Convention Center. It's part of several blocks of re-development (at least from when I was child here in the 60s) that combines many restaurants, Outlet shopping, attractions and activity centers for boating and tours etc. The Aquarium was very clean and the displays were well constructed and easy to navigate. They are actively researching the many types of jellyfish and their roll in the ecosystem and benefits to all of us. They have a multi-story glass wall tank in the main display area that is spectacular and really a great place to watch divers feed the resident eels, sharks, sea bass, and rays. Their outdoor areas include a free-flight aviary where you can feed Lorikeets that are very colorful and friendly. It has a very reasonable admission cost that can be combined with a harbor tour boat trip. There were many youth groups there with us on a Saturday afternoon and lent a really upbeat and energizing atmosphere. It's not Sea World or Marine Land but they don't try to be and do a very nice job in representing and demonstrating scientific support and research. We will be back.",Darrel C
40,Making learning fun!,We're members of the AoP (Aquarium of the Pacific). Our kids are 6y.o. And 4 y.o. We try to go when it's not crowded. It's a popular field trip destination for local schools. It's usually quiet after lunch. We go to feed the lorikeets and pet the Sharks. They have a few hands on exhibits and the docents are generally well informed so the curious can learn a thing or two.,Cherie Mae B
50,perfect experience for young children,This aquarium is so great that i have become a member. the aquarium has wonderful critters including leafy dragons which are amazing and beautiful. you will be amazed around every place you walk.,Ruth B
30,"Great visit for small children, but watch your wallet...","Had a blast taking my god kids to spend a few hours there. Exhibits are visible to children of any age or in strollers. The accessibility was excellent with a baby in tow, even on second floors.Whole visit takes about 3 hrs max, with extra long kids-pressed-to-glass time.Ultimately, it's pricey for what you get... but if you have lunch or dinner at the local restaurant it can make for a nice day trip.",Matt H
40,Beautiful design and display of Pacific sealife,"This Long Beach Aquarium is not huge, but they make up in quality what they lack in quantity.The educational programs are excellent.The aquarium offers instructional materials for teachers.Well worth a half-day visit.They also offer whale watching excursions.",LJC309
50,Fun!,This is a very nice aquarium with a lot of interactive activities for all ages. We loved the JELLIES!!,Karen J
50,The Jellyfish!,Went here with family and small kids. The facility is laid out very well didn't feel crowded at all. Many interactive things for kids and grown ups alike. Get the passport to stamp while you're there. Truly the most interesting collection of Jellyfish. We spent 3 hours there and it the time just flew by. Don't miss the various touch tanks there everything from Jellyfish to sea urchins. The sea otter show was super cool too. Great experience for all age groups. Staff was very informative and helpful.,Rosie H
50,The best Aquarium I have ever been to!,The best Aquarium I have ever been to! A must see!!! So many jelly fish. Price is high I think but its a once in a lifetime thing to see.,brownard
30,OK,"The aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach is a nice place to bring a small child and spend a couple of hours but no more than three. In comparison to other aquariums I've seen, this one is average. It has the usual large glass aquarium in the Foyer which is very beautiful, but nothing unusual as aquariums go. It's rather pedestrian here but since Long Beach doesn't have a lot of attractions this is one of the best places to go",Jon M
50,Pet the Sharks!,"Cute and charismatic sharks? The petting tank with the bamboo and mangrove sharks will change your perception. I had no idea these little sharks even existed.We got discount tickets through the hotel where we were staying on Catalina Island, so check for promotions. Also, there is a free bus that goes here from the Queen Mary.My husband and I are big fans of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, so we were expecting to be underwhelmed, but the Aquarium of the Pacific was quite good and surprisingly large, even though not quite on the Monterey Bay scale. It has nooks and crannies where you might accidentally miss entire galleries. (We almost missed the deep ocean gallery, as well as one on the second floor.) The jellyfish display was awesome! I have never seen such an extensive display of these amazing creatures. Think you know jellyfish displays? Visit and be surprised!The free-flight aviary was a total surprise, and you can have lorikeets (I think they were lorikeets?) perching on you, drinking nectar, or just hanging out, as they are quite tame.The Magellanic penguins were also wonderful. We first met Paddles at an informational show on penguins, then stopped by the habitat twice, once to just watch these charismatic little birds, then again at feeding time.Don't miss the dragon fish! They look like seaweed and are amazing! They also have a giant Pacific octopus. We attended a presentation where her caretaker told us all about her and how she figured out how to open jars, and was trained to get in a basket for weighing and for when they clean her cage.The aquarium was set up for kids at Christmas, and ""Diver Santa"" was hokey but informative, and kids could visit Santa later. Fun and innovative gingerbread constructions on display. Lots of young people with demos for kids, such as comparing cold water with sticking your hand in ""blubber"" and seeing how it insulated you. Glad they have educational interactions. Not sure how another reviewer said there was nothing for adults, as I'm 61, and had the time of my life, including checking some of the kid stuff, which I found interesting. The aquarium in general is first-rate!",Jilara
40,Fun and interactive,We almost didn't go because of the price. Our teenagers are considered adults and the should have a student rate but we ended up going and we're glad we did. They loved how interactive it was. We loved the exhibit where you can feed the parakeets. They landed all over us. We also loved the otter show. We loved all the touch pools.,Faith H
50,Fun visit!,Stopped in for a visit. A nice facility. Saw some things I've never seen before. Also had the opportunity to touch a few underwater creatures. We went in the afternoon and were told we just missed the kids. I guess a lot of schools visit this location. You may want to call if you want to try and avoid the school crowds.,Maria F
50,Beautiful Aquarium!,"Very nice. Very big. Beautiful displays. We were just killing time waiting for our flight out of LGB. This is a really wonderful aquarium. Very clean and well put together. We encountered several schools on field trips, it's good to know the children can learn so much about sealife here. There are plenty of interactive areas too.",navymom64
40,Sunday Morning visiting Aquarium of the long beach,"This place is good for family... boring if you are alone. They dont have atraction for adults, just for children.",Paula D
30,23rd ANNIVERSARY ADVENTURE,"My husband and I had a two for one coupon which was quite nice, We found the aquarium just okay, kids will love it, plenty for kids to see and do, two finger touch pools with plenty for them to enjoy, The were okay, somewhat informative.",Jane F
40,Good day out,We were visiting Long Beach and came across the aquarium. Lots of good and different areas with different creatures to see and learn about,Michael R
40,Fish Eye Views ...,Love visiting an Aquarium and Long Beach's one is quite nice and its huge. It's well organized and you get an understanding of the sea creatures from each Pacific zone / area. Has special exhibitions so returning reveals something new. TIP: get the combo ticket which includes the Queen Mary! Enjoy. ...,David B L
50,Time very well spent,"My wife and I had a pre cruise visit to Long Beach recently and were looking for something to do on the Sunday morning. The concierge at the Westin suggested the Aquarium and while we thought the admission a little pricey we decided to go. It turned out to be one of the highlights of our vacation.The building itself is modern and well designed to maximize traffic flow. Being a Sunday, there were lots of people but we were never overwhelmed by crowds. The interactive displays were most interesting and informative with knowledgeable young staff giving talks and answering all questions. Sea lions, seals, sharks, rainbow trout, sea otters, rays and more were subjects of these talks which lasted fifteen minutes or so each and are spaced throughout the day.The indoor displays with all variety of sea life were nothing short of stunning, in terms of the unbelievable colors, variety and presentation. We took lots of pictures and looking at them now, it hardly seems possible that they could be real.One of the things that we found impressive was the way that the exhibits and the young staff connected with the young visitors, none of whom looked to be bored and were often pointing excitedly, asking questions etc.We spent four hours, and the time flew by. Time and money well spent and our highest recommendation.",Terry A
40,Aquarium of the Pacific,Fun family place! great for small children. We have been here multiple times over the years w/ our children & now grandchild!,Janet D
40,The Aquarium of the Pacific is a must see in Long Beach!,"Lots of wonderful creatures to see and actually get to touch. Loved this place, a must to visit while visiting Long Beach.",marknlinda2012
50,"A surprisingly fine aquarium, particularly for a state with Monterey Bay!","We are old aquarium hands, and never miss the chance to visit one, and we were pleasantly surprised by the displays, the teaching, and the staff. Considering that CA already has one of the greatest aquaria in the world (Monterey Bay), it was particularly impressive to see the sharks, various California habitats, penguins, and the amazing weedy and more elaborate weedy seadragons. In addition to the aquatic displays, they have a walk-through Lorikeet habitat, with about 10 species of these beautiful, lively, and unusual parrots. There were lots of families, with happy kids in tow.",Mary M
40,Exhibits are wonderful,The exhibits here are beautiful and very educational. Not just for kids! Be prepared to spend several hours.,one_aceracer
40,Not a bad place,"Upon entering the facility, the first I noticed was the whale suspended overhead. Want to talk about something that grabs your attention. Whales are the largest mammals on the planet, and seeing one over your head really puts that into perspective. The aquarium has a long central corridor with galleries on either side, although the main entrances to those are located on the second floor. The two main galleries focused on the northern Pacific Ocean, and the tropical region. There were smaller sections for the southern Pacific, and marine mammals.One of the exhibits we found the most fascinating were the jellyfish. There are many species present of these fabulous creatures, and they’re so unlike anything else we have on our planet. And to think about what other interesting things nature has come up, look no further than the sea dragon. I’d never seen one of these before, and could see why they could be mistaken for a branch floating in the water. Like their sea horse relatives, the males carry and give birth to the young.It was nice to stop and look at the fish swimming by in the tanks, and sometimes it was just as interesting to look at all the various colors and shapes of the corals. Being able to maintain living coral is difficult due to factors like light and temperature sensitivity, so it’s impressive this exhibit is present.After passing the otter enclosure, the aquarium opens to an outdoor section with a penguin habitat, and a section where guests were allowed to reach out and touch a ray. With a light two-finger touch, I felt the leathery-skin as the critter glided by. There’s also animal shows which happen throughout the day, as well as the Ocean Theatre to view 3D and 4D movies, and a kiosk at the Ocean Science Center showing presentations from the NOAA. The guide book which comes with the admission has a good map, as well as a visual guide for the animals within the facility.",Dave M
50,Always a great way to spend a day,We get a membership each year to support this wonderful aquarium. It is great to have such a great aquarium so close to us.,Sandy C
40,perfect for kids,this is a rainy day activity or if it is too hot outside. accessible by passport bus. many educational oppoortunity,GramChris
40,Fun visit,"My husband and I had a very nice visit to the Aquarium of the Pacific. I suggest downloading the Aquarium's app to your phone for better ease in navigation and for keeping track of the daily schedule. Lots of opportunities for touching rays, small sharks, etc., which we did not do but seemed to be very popular.They have indoor and outdoor exhibits, and many varied activities. We enjoyed walking through the Lorikeet Forest, where you can purchase cups of nectar to feed the birds as you walk through. They had a great exhibit on different kinds of jellyfish. Our favorite exhibits included the penguins and sea otters, as well as some gorgeous collections of colorful tropical fish. There is a very large gift shop that truly has something for everyone. We purchased a combo ticket that also included admittance to the nearby Queen Mary, and felt that it was a good deal. Well worth a visit!",Kitten8r
50,A great family experience!,This is a top of the list aquarium with great deplsplays and specie collection.I recommend all grandparents take their grandkids for an unforgettable day,Unbongout
20,Know your dates,We went during a home school learning day. It was insane. Thought going on a Thursday would have make it more quiet. We spend 30 minutes there as we were pushed all the time. Im sure if it wasn't filled with 500+ kids it would have been more enjoyable.,Mellz01
50,A fantastic day!,We took our granddaughter to the Aquarium for the day and had a wonderful time.The surrounding grounds give great views and afford a lot of picture opportunities.If you have not been there give it a visit!,Sapphire Ed
30,Nice and specialized on jelly fish,"It is for sure nice with a huge number of Jelly fish that I never seen even on bigger acquarium like Valencia, Lisboa, Genova. There is a nice shark pool and some interactive attractions that are perfect for children. The only delta is the price close to 30 Dollars a little bit too much for the size and number of attractions. Anyway a place that you can't miss once there.",Max A
40,Surprisingly pleasant experience,I had seen aquarium several years before when it first opened. It is now very much improved and an impressive family exeperience,wr11
40,Interesting visit,"We enjoyed seeing the penguins, sharks and especially all the varieties of jellies. A great place to stroll around, inside and out.",Patricia B
40,Day of fun,"Nice, but once you seen one aquarium you've seen them all. The day we were there must've been the counties elementary school today because there were hundreds of elementary kids there. The staff was nice and informative.",Dawna D
50,Very interesting Visit!,We were staying in Long Beach and visited this as it was not far from our hotel. We spent a very interesting and enjoyable afternoon there. There were lots of interesting exhibits there which we had never seen before. The sea lion show was very entertaining. I would recommend this for a visit. It is good for families and children with lots of touch pools and interactive displays,Lynda C
50,Great venue to see our sea life.,"This is another great family venue and is very interesting and well designed. Kids love this place, and so did I.",1jjarecki
50,"Fantastic Displays, But Crowded","If you enjoy sealife, this place has it all. Beautiful displays of local sea life as well as tropical fish and creatures, even hands-on tide pools where you can touch small sharks and rays. We decided to go on their Halloween activities day, so it was a bit of a madhouse. If we had chosen a less-buy time, we would have enjoyed it more. Our bad!",brothermoses
50,Really Cool,"I had previously lived in Long Beach and I have been back several times to visit, on my list trip however I decided to finally go and check out the aquarium. It was totally worth it. They have fascinating tanks of jellyfish, small sharks and other interesting marine life. Before visiting though, check out goldstar.com for deals on tickets. You can often get half price or cheaper tickets if purchased in advance.",Bill D
50,Love this place,"The aquarium has a lot to see, great place for kids and families. There are shows all of the time and there are exhibits to touch. The cafe is a nice place for lunch and they have a variety of foods.",Jen M
30,Overbilled family activity,We went this weekend on a cloudy winter day in Los Angeles. I was surprised at how standard it was for how much advertising they do. The San Diego Birch acquarium is a better outing in my opinion. We spent about an hour or so meandering around. The bird exhibit was an odd pairing for the site. I'd rather take a Harbour cruise instead since the tickets aren't inexpensive. Tip: use your triple a card for a slight discount.,calitravlerone
50,Learning about our aquatic friends,"My daugter and I took her 3 children to this aquarium in November. There was almost too many activities, we enjoyed as many as we could. My 5 year old grandson was very enthralled with the booklet embossing activity. All three really enjoyed that. The sharks were amazing,everything was presented wonderfully. The Lorikeets were a big hit also. The kids loved feeding them the nectar. My favorite was the tropicals, such an amazing variety! Was well worth the time and money spent.",AKmom
50,Oceanic Delight!,"The Aquarium of the Pacific is so beautifully designed, and the sea creatures are so magically exhibited! I enjoy it most when it is NOT crowded. It is a very popular attraction, and rightfully so. However, my preference oof when to go to the Aquarium, especially if you don't have kids and just want to leisurely enjoy the magnificence and potential of serenity of the aqauarium, select a weekday; call ahead andd find out if there are any 'field trips' are sceduled, ask about their slowest days and slowest seasons, then take advantage! The aquarium is not just for children! Watch for special adult events such as Friday night photography night. I once went to a company christmas party there; it was covered in tiny twinkliy lights, with a cash bar, and catered food.The number of people was small. It was the BEST chritmas party ever! consider using it as a venue. it is the most amazing place ever, at night, with twinkly lights. when children are absent and it's just Grown up night. A flute of champagne, a delish desert...lower sound level...consider it for prom or high school reunion, wedding, wedding reception, anniversary party. You will NEVER foget it, and never regret it!",Paula P
50,Beautiful exihibits and very ecologically responsible education,"Had a blast touring through this fantastic aquarium! Coming from Chicago and did a few days of site seeing in Long Beach and Newport Beach, this aquarium was one of the best I have been to! They have wonderful exhibits, both inside and out. The whole experience is geared towards ecological education to the public and the message done tastefully. I enjoyed the layout for the most part, but did get lost in a corner with birds at one point?!The sea lions and seal show was extremely entertaining for all ages, allthough the seeting on concrete steps is rather uncomfortable. The unusuall sharks exhibits are fantastic with guitar fish and saw fish, that you don't see at most aquariums. The hands on experiences are plentiful and we saw many families with children who never got bored! I highly recommend for both young and old!",Anne H
50,Outstanding aquarium!,Tremendous place especially for children. Wonderful otters and penguins and an enormous kelp forest with sharks and smaller fish.,pennydash
50,Lots of educational fun!,"We purchased passes so that we could come regularly. We took our time each visit with a different area, it was well worth the money!",kitskornerdotcom
30,"Small, busy aquarium","Maybe not fair to compare, but did not find this aquarium as interesting as others. Great for kids, as there are many areas to run around, but as for adults, much of the marine life viewing was limited and murky.",twinsaround
50,I love this place,"I became a member so I can go when I want to. Here is my tip. Make it a fun day for the kids and take the Passport or Aqua Ferry to the AOP. Have breakfast at Schooner or Later, then walk to the Passport Aqua ferry and ride over to AOP. It is about $5 dollar for the ride over. You don't have to fight traffic or pay for parking. The kids get a boat ride which is lots of fun. Coming back just take the local bus or Aqua taxi back. Boat ride and a day at the Aquarium. Now, if you are Ocean Water certified think about scuba diving in the tank. It is expensive but well worth the price.",Trails4GMZ
50,Wonderful displays of our ocean creatures,Lovely assortment of marine life and little presentations by staff however the signage is poorly lit for those of us who like to read about what we are seeing in the tanks.,OMGYumYum
50,"Granddaughter""s Favorite!","We arrived early, before the school buses arrive. Parking across the area for eight dollars a day. We had a wonderful time, very educational with their signage at each exhibit, hands on outdoors at the tide tidepools was a delight , and for a seven year old, three hours was plenty for her. We shared a lunch, grilled cheese and fries were plenty in a very nice indoor cafe.",MHM316
50,$125 Family membership is the way to go!,Our four year old loved this place. Fun and interactive. I enjoyed the extensive jellyfish collection. Our teenage daughter was mesmerized with the variety of seals. So glad we got the family membership so we can visit again.,BobbyLynch
50,A rare glimpse of the seas!,"This is a wonderful aquarium but it can become overly crowded during peak visiting times. Come during the week if possible. The displays are marvelous and the staff is knowledgeable, personable and engaging! The harbor cruises next to the aquarium are worthwhile and fun as well.",Doozer2015
50,One of the very best Aquariums that I've visited!,"This is a fun and engaging aquarium experience. It has the best assortment of jellyfish and coral reefs that I've seen in any U.S. aquarium. Plan to spend at least 3-4 hours to see everything that this aquarium has to offer. Unlike most aquariums, this aquarium has both indoor and outdoor exhibits which allowed us to enjoy the bright and sunny California weather.",Don A
50,One of my favorite aquariums in the country,Every time we are in southern California we stop here. The indoor tanks and exhibits are beautiful and interesting. The outdoor exhibits are great and the kids love the sharks and rays. The horseshoe crabs are fascinating. The lorikeet enclosure is fun if you like birds. It is a smaller aquarium and doable in 3 hours with big kids so took advantage of the Groupon for entry after 3pm. Totally worthwhile and great restaurants for kids nearby.,Jen B
40,Definitely great for kids!,"Our first visit and the place was filled with children. One could sense their enthusiasm and thrill of visiting these beautiful and educational exhibits. Adding to the fun is grabbing a visiior guide and getting it stamped in different locations. Other programs and adventures with the aquarium are available for an additional fee such as behind-the-scenes tour, harbor tours, whale watching, etc.",PepperNewJersey
40,Worth a visit when in Long Beach,"The Aquarium of the Pacific is a relatively large facility with the expected range of displays and activities including anemone tanks, larger fish tanks, touch tanks, movies, and narrated programs. It's a little tough when up the coast at Monterey is one of the best aquariums in the world. AOP isn't quite in the same league, but it's still a very nice aquarium in a nice harbor with numerous restaurants and shops. It's worth a visit if you're in the area.",Karl B
40,"Leafy and weedy seadragons, how incredible!","A great medium-sized aquarium with lots of exhibits. Following the booklet is a challenge if you want to get all the passport stamps, but it's fun.

50,Better than Sea World!,"We loved the Aquarium of the Pacific this past weekend! I didn't expect much, going into it, but I was amazed by how much there was to see! I went to Sea World as a kid, but I've soured on that given all the negative attention of late. The aquarium, however, is not a negative experience and the animals are not on display for entertainment purposes. I really enjoyed being able to meet the bat rays, sharks, and watch the sea lions play! Great experience!",Jenn S
40,Interesting fish and birds,"Plenty of tanks here, with all sorts of fish. There are birds outside in a avery which you can walk through so the birds can land on you. We also saw two interesting films in the 3D cinema. I was glad we had the time to visit.",Jim J
40,Nice exhibits and not crowded on a Thursday,This was a very nice aquarium but small compared to others I've been to such as the one in New Orleans. Was not too crowded but had many tourist taking many photos. Nice gift shop. For an adult doesn't take but a couple hours to see all the exhibits.,lindagK1722BF

40,Fall Visit to the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach,"Staff at this Aquarium are very helpful, with many enthusiastic Volunteers. The entrance Hall has a gift shop and is quite large with a model of a Whale hanging from the vast ceiling. impressive. most of the aquarium winds its way through interior passageways that hold the presentation tanks and some of the displays are outside. Jelly fish displays were the highlight for me. absolutely delightfully colorful and you can get close to see the graceful dance of these creatures. Divers enter tanks and converse through microphones. interesting. the only thing that i found ""cold"" was so much concrete. Could we pretty that up somehow? all in all a very awe inspiring afternoon and being mid Fall, at 2pm, no school field trips with full and easy access to the tank viewing.",Yvonne R
50,Perfect activity!,"I must admit: I was hesitant. Each adult ticket costs almost $30, which is rather steep.However, after just a few minutes inside, we realized it would be worth EVERY penny.There are over 13,000 animals in the aquarium. It is very well marked, easy to follow and a nice blend of looking and interaction.The scuba diver presentation is a must see!",iheartco25
30,Busy,"I haven't been to the aquarium in years and decided to go with a girlfriend of mine. I didn't realize that they would be so packed on a Sunday afternoon.

There is food and beverage offered and a variety of musical artists. I expect we'll be attending several concerts next summer.Check out the Aquarium Calendar for a variety of terrific events for locals.

50,Very Impressive - both the Buildings and the Collection,We were very impressed by this Aquarium which was very well laid out architecturally and displayed its marine exhibits in an imaginative and sensitive manner.Spent much more time looking around than we had planned - lots to see.,BobandJosie
40,Better than I remembered!,"Tons of loud kids even on a Tuesday. I hit all the special talks by divers in the tanks, trainers with the otters, sea lions, etc. My favorite exhibit is the weedy sea dragons, but I really enjoyed many of the tanks. Not Monterey, but worth a visit.",Lori B
50,"Beatiful aquarium of local fauna, pretty good flow even on busy weekends",I was a founding member and still love it after all these years. They concentrate on local fish and animals. Otters are cool and love their mola mola( sunfish) and massive kelp forest display,Timothy V
40,A really fine aquarium,"First class aquariums are hard to find, but I just learned this weekend that California has two. While not quite up to world class Monterey this facility has much to offer including sea mammals and a great array of fish and wonderfully constructed and maintained habitats. One unanswered question (unusual because the staff is plentiful, engaging and very knowledgable) is how so many integrated habitats (sea otters and schools of fish; sharks and schools of fish) seem to thrive with out predation losses. But they all seem to be thriving.Great facility, superb commitment to education and an amazing collection of seas creatures makes this a ""highly recommended""!",Jay S
50,Everything a family could wish for!,A beautiful aquarium! The exhibits were amazing. Fun for the whole family. Make sure you get the program and the stamp for each section - makes for a fun experience. My favourite was the sea horses. So much fun!,Doreen V
40,Aquarium of the Pacific,We went here in the morning before our Segway tour. The Aquarium was nice. It tooks us a couple of hours to tour. We were on the Grand Princess and Long Beach was one of our ports.,jackiera1
40,"Not Monterey, but still an excellent, interesting aquarium for all ages","Beautiful and very informative exhibits of coral reefs, sea anemones, jelly fish, and tropical fish. There also delightful sea otter and penguin tanks and special exhibits where you can gently touch manta rays and anemones. There were many aquarium staff presenting fun and educational information about the creatures, their habitats, and ocean conservation. I visited on a Sunday afternoon, so the aquarium was quite crowded with families. Though the noise level was high, I was charmed to see quite small children excitedly shouting, ""Anemones!"" I took the free Passport shuttle bus back to my hotel. The cafe offered a variety of food choices. It was crowded and noisy, but my tuna sandwich and salad were made fresh to order and were good quality.",WiscoLakeGirl
40,"Great place, great location","This place is surrounded with many shopping centers, restaurants, and beaches. The view is so beautiful. The aquarium itself is nice with plenty to see.

10,Sharks trapped in a small space,"It was heart breaking to see so many sharks confined in such a small area, they don't belong in that aquarium, they need to be swimming free out in the open ocean. Its time to transition to virtual aquariums and stop trapping these poor fish.",Elizabeth A
50,Outstanding...Get Combo Pass,"We planned on touring just the U.S.S. Iowa, but decided to purchase a combo pass at the ticket window. Glad we did!The aquarium was awesome! Great exhibits, and many were interactive. My son absolutely loved it. Do not miss!Only downside was the Cafe...food was gross.",Bill M
50,Really Really Cool Visit,"This aquarium is well worth the price of admission! There is so much to see and do. There are several interactive exhibits where you can touch the animals. There is also several ""shows"" to see. I highly recommend the seals and sea lions show!",Ditzgrl02
50,Beautiful aquarium!,This aquarium is clean and beautifully done. I wanted to see the Giant Pacific Octopus and was delighted that she was in an inviting enclosure with lots of natural plants and places for her to feel at home. The water throughout the aquarium looked clear and all of the creatures appeared happy and healthy in their environments.,AliSt0ne
40,It's an Otters Life,"It's amazing all the mammals & animals you see. Definitely worth tiger the coupons before you go. The entrance leaves an impressive awe to your mind with a spectacular glass wall of sea life before your eyes. The otters are quite entertaining as well as the touch a ray. It is more than an aquarium, it brings to life all of what makes SoCal so special.I gave it a 4 because it's expensive for families.",Native2tx
30,Great for kids!,"I was in Long Beach for a conference and went to the Aquarium on a Saturday. It was very crowded. As an adult, I didn't see anything really new that I haven't seen before at other Aquariums - I enjoyed Atlanta's Aquarium better. But the kids I saw really enjoyed this place. They had a lot of interactive exhibits for kids to have hands on experience. I wasn't interested, but many other people were. There were parts of the Aquarium that was outside - that was unexpected and nice. I wouldn't come back if I was in Long Beach, but if you have kids with you on the trip, it would be a nice spot.",Marge B
50,A long fun day!,We have gone to the aquarium every year for the last 4 years while in California. This last time I took my parents they had a great time. You can be a kid or a grandparent you will enjoy yourself. Don't rush yourself as there is so much to see and do. Go outside and feed the birds and pet the sharks. Once inside you will be amazed at all there is to see. The grandkids have loved this place since the first time they saw it and ask to go back all the time. There are good places to eat close by and parking is easy and close. Enjoy yourself!,Jim L
40,Fun time for our family!,"We got to pet sharks and sting rays and saw some really unique things, like live shark embryos! Our 2 year old son also got to give a scuba diver a high 5 through the glass, which he loved. We had a great time!",sixthsmith
40,"Great aquarium, lots of interaction, a little pricey","My two and a half year old loved it! They had several hands-on areas where you could feel starfish, jelly fish, small sharks, etc. to get kids engaged. They also had several scheduled ""shows"" throughout the day - divers cleaning the tank, seals and sea lions doing tricks, etc.There was a pretty good array of sea life, including penguins, many fish, lots of jelly fish, seals, sea lions, and sharks. There was also an area with birds where you could feed them from little cups.",Mandi S
50,Long Beach Entertainment,"So much fun watching the Jellies float around!! Also the Sea Dragons are so cool. We went early and it was a good thing as it became very busy around noon. At 10:00 am they have a Penguin Walk,they switch up the area so you have to ask the location, which is really adorable to watch. Don't miss The Shark Lagoon where you can touch small sharks and sting rays!! Picked up some coupons for $7 off adult admission and also handed out some to ppl attending, you can find them @KFC",JCavall
50,50% off Coupons make it well worth it!,"I ended up taking my wife and 2 kids to the aquarium last weekend. I didnt want to pay full price so I searched the best coupon for this place. Eventually I was able to get a food the from the LA Citysavver.com website so I ened up paying $68 for 4 admissions instead of $116.Anyway the aquarium was awesome! The kids loved petting the sharks and stingrays and I personally loved seeing the flashlight fish. My wife enjoed the sea lions the most, I can honestly say that this place hadsomething for everyone in my family.I ened up taking my family on a whale watching cruise using the money I saved on the discounted tickets (also puchased at discount) so basically I ened up paying less to go to both the aquarium and whale watching for less than I would have paid to go to the aquarium alone by finding the right discounts first.",Marshall H
50,Certainly a fine way to spend an afternoon...,"A very nice aquarium with a competent and friendly staff. Certainly 'kid' oriented but with enough exhibits to satisfy the older folks. Somewhat smaller than we expected (after visiting the Monterey Bay Aquarium), but certainly a fine way to spend an afternoon in Long Beach.",DennisKessinger
40,well spent afternoon,this is a great aquarium--perfect for an afternoon--we spent about 3 hours here watching the shows and wandering around. We especially liked the shark exhibit,Solperros
50,Great for families,Great way to start your day in Long Beach. This is a small Aquarium with a great outside part that kids love.,Lisa O
30,Fun trip,"We had a fun time with our 3 and 1 year old boys. We enjoyed the outdoor exhibits. A bit disappointing for the adults when compared to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Overall the venue is small and feels touristy. A nice trip nonetheless, but we probably won't feel the need to return.",476kristinap
50,"Fun afternoon in Long Beach, great aquarium","I love all aquariums, and Long Beach is another aquarium off my list! Sharks, tropical fish, and birds oh my!",TXGirlinKY
50,Really nice aquarium,One of the nicest aquarium we've been to. Really nice exhibits. There is enough room and places to go even though they were busy we were able to see whatever we wanted.,mailmom
40,Good but pricey,Enjoyable experience with a nice variety of aquatic life. Expected it to be bigger based on the price.,Adam L
50,Best Aquarium!,"I'm not a west-coaster or from Southern CA, so the idea of having half an aquarium outside blew my mind. It was so nice to be outside and see the sharks, rays, and penguins. All of the exhibits looked very nice, and the layout of the aquarium was great. I liked that the tanks were arranged by where the animals would be found, i.e. the Pacific Northwest exhibit.The admission price was very reasonable! I didn't feel overcharged at all.My favorite part was where you could touch all sorts of sea life... urchins, anemones, sea cucumbers.. very cool!The gift shop was great too! Something there for everyone.",Huey L
30,Not worth the price.,The price to get in is too high. It takes less then a hour to view the fish. I would only go back if I had a coupon.,cherylsB4265JO
50,Amazing!,"We had a lot of fun at the aquarium! lots of exhibits and things to see! I especially loved going outside and petting the small sharks and stingrays. The sea lions routine was amazing as well!There were a ton of people for some sort of festival, but I guess that is to be expected.A lot of jellyfish exhibits... I noticed those a lot.All in all a wonderful place. We had a pretzel and a shake at jamba juice and both were delicious.",Taylor P
30,Disappointing,We were disappointed in the size and diversity of exhibits. We had expected this to be similar to the wonderful aquariums in Baltimore or Mystic.,rhkfreespirit
50,Sammy and Rosie's Big Adventure!,A fantastic journey under the sea!! Loads of fascinating things to see and do including using a giant Google map to find home! There were lots of amazing creatures and we took some wonderful photo's as a reminder. Brilliant price as we booked the LA Zoo and the Aquarium as one package. Definitely worth a visit and the staff were really friendly and helpful as well!!,sammy B
50,Some of the most beautiful exhibits I've ever seen in an aquarium,"My concierge had a coupon for deeply discounted tickets at this aquarium, so do ask at your hotel. Overall, a nicely organized aquarium with room to handle large crowds comfortably. All of the tanks were well maintained and several held really interesting specimens I have never seen at larger aquariums. An eye to color made for some breathtakingly beautiful tanks. Plenty of well staffed touch tanks for the smaller set. I'm not entirely sure what a Central American cultural festival (going on while we were there) has to do with marine life, but the Quatemalan dancers didn't interfere too much with seeing the fish, although the noise was a little disconcerting. Plenty of chain restaurants just outside the aquarium for meals and a nice touristy area for walking. We did not sample their cafe.",AHNack
50,Great Alternative to Sea World,Friends told us about the Aquarium of the Pacific and how much they enjoyed visiting. We wanted to do something different and gave it a try. So glad we did! The displays were interesting and entertaining. My favorite had to be the jelly fish. My daughter loved the hands-on areas with the sharks and sting-rays. It's a modern and well kept facility. Staff was willing to stop and talk. A few school groups came through but we still felt like we could easily see everything we wanted to and up-close. The Aquarium is wonderful alternative to the crowded and expensive theme parks in the area and every bit as enjoyable.,cf2011
50,Aquarium of the Pacific,"Very nice place to with your family and children....Sharks, dolphins and a lot more to see.....Must visit place for all age groups",Akib S
50,Great Family Day,"We are members of the Aquarium of the Pacific and feel like we get so much bang for our buck. The kids LOVE it here, and have learned so much. Make time for the sting ray feedings, and the Lorakeet sugar cups are a fun extra too. My kids could play all day in the outdoor splash area.",Meg R
50,Interesting,Very interesting.The kids will love it.Plenty to keep them occupied.Go early as it gets quite busy later in the day.,PeteH27
30,Tourist attraction spot,It is a very small aquarium compared to others I have been to. The fish collections are kind of limited. The place is kept cleaned. Many staffs are on duty. Not many animal shows. You can see the whole place in less than 2 hours.The admission is about $26 for adult. I will suggest buying on Goldstar.com for $12 (3-6pm). 3 hours is more than enough and also less crowded.The Parking: Long line to get into the parking structure ($7). Short walk to the aquarium.,ILoveFoodComa
50,It has everything!,This was our first visit here. What a well done facility. The entrance fee is a little pricey but the quality of the many tanks of sea creatures is phenomenol. From the Sharks to the Sea Lions and everything in between this venue has it all. Most of it is indoors with large glass viewing windows to see into the tanks which have crystal clear water to view the sea life. We enjoyed our morning here and will be back.,qwerty103
50,Shouldn't miss if in Long Beach.,"This is an excellent aquarium right downtown, Walkable distance of many hotels and a parking ramp across the street. It is family friendly, has a family friendly restaurant and a separate, quiet bar for adults. We were there over the Labor Day weekend so it was very crowded but still manageable.",728joanns
40,Young At Heart,"My husband and I have wanted to visit this aquarium for years and finally made it. First, parking was a breeze. There is covered parking garage across from the aquarium. You do have to pay for it but there is a discount if you pay at the same time you get your aquarium tickets. For the aquarium tickets we used our AAA discount. Nice little discount. The guide book is given to you but it's more than that. It has areas within each section where the kids or kids at heart can get their stamp when needed. It was fun to hunt for those stamping areas. Of course, the sea life is amazing. We watched a number of different live and film shows. I would recommend this aquarium it has many exhibits and hands on areas that make it special.",AzSummerrose
50,Reasonably priced attraction,Be sure to look for local discounts! $28 admission for adults. Found a voucher for $7 off regular admission. There are also tours available for additional costs.The aquarium has a number of displays that are educational and interactive for visitors. There are both indoor and outdoor exhibits w/ feeding and show schedules. Well worth the time and cost!,akra_meesh
50,Beautiful and Educational,"This place was just amazing. It was so great to have the touch tanks for the kids to touch sharks. sting rays, jelly fish and anemone. The penguins were so much fun to watch. It was educational and beautiful. There was nothing boring. We spent a good amount of time there and enjoyed every minute. The jellyfish displays were gorgeous. This is from someone who is afraid of underwater creatures. I would not touch anything, but my kids loved it!!!! We would definitely go back. Long Beach is beautiful!!!!",Suzanne746
50,Love this aquarium,"Went to the aquarium last Friday with my husband and 21 yr old daughter. We have been many times before - had passes when the kids were small. We love this aquarium. Friday was the day to be there as there weren't any field trips (school just started too, which helped). I say that as we have been here when it is packed - and that is always less fun. Our favorite parts of the museum are the jellies and seahorses. However, I think they just do it up right - they have different sections for what you would find in different areas of the world - the Gulf Coast, California etc. They have divers in the larger tanks that educate on the species in the tanks, they have people in all areas to help educate about whatever it is you are seeing. They have many touching stations, inside and out. They also have a lorikeet (bird) area where you can go into an enclosure and feed the birds while they sit all over you. Overall, it's a nice little aquarium that is well done.",Hopnrocks
40,The Jellyfish Are Everywhere,Smaller aquarium with beats features.I love just browsing through the exhibits and seeing all the amazing looking creatures. It can be very relaxing and sometimes mesmerizing watching the way the fish swim or the jellyfish float up and down.Fun place to take kids.,shmoi
50,Fun day with kids,We had such a good day with the kids. Really good learning experience for the kids. They have a lot of different types of fish and the shark lagoon was fun.,Betzy S
50,Be Amazed!,I adore this place. You can see all kinds of fish. I especially like the little seahorses. It's wonderful to view them. Great place to bring the kids. Everybody would love this place I'm sure. Everybody is so friendly. I also came here for a concert and the atmosphere was beautiful.,tomjonesCalifornia
50,We absolutely love and adore this aquarium!!,"This aquarium is the best we have ever been to (I've still got my sights on the Georgia Aquarium to see the Whale Sharks), and we will come back any time we're in California! The exhibits are awesome, and there is SO MUCH TO SEE!!! The Saw Fish and giant Manta (?) Ray were a sight to see for sure, and the shark feeding was informative and totally an experience that both kids and adults will enjoy.",livs_mama
50,You will love it,We have visited a few sea life centres in the UK but wow nothing compares to this so much to see and do the whole family love it.,Normiejoe
50,Take Grandpa,"Yes, this is a great place for kids. It is also a treat for us older folk. It has continued to be well maintained and operated, as well as educational. The staff is pleasant and helpful. There are special lectures and concerts to attend. Membership is a bargain. A community asset that has maintained its quality and value over time,",Richard L
40,Always a wonderful time!,This is one of the most beautiful and enjoyable spots in Long Beach. Going during the week does cut down on the crowds but it is located in such a great spot with several nice restaurants nearby.,Lisa A
40,Beautiful experience,"The Aquarium is spectacular. I highly recommend for both adults and children. They also have discounts through AAA, and right now KFC has a discount promotion. You can always Google for discount promotions before going anywhere.They also have several package deals with whale cruises, the zoo, etc.",Shannon R
50,Small but interesting,"Is a small aquarium, in and out areas. Children's will enjoy very much this aquarium. Tanks in the out side area, visitors can interact with some fish (touch them). Nice birds exhibit.",Arnaldo V
50,Great aquarium!,"We really enjoyed the exhibits and found the docents very knowledgeable and engaging. They also had a great pictorial exhibit about California water. Historical and geologic.My favorite part was seeing the horseshoe crabs. I've always wanted to see them in person.I also highly recommend the 3 1/2 hr whale watching trip. The boat leaves from right outside the aquarium. We had a beautiful day and saw two whales, a blue and a humpback. Also some white sided dolpins. Wonderful trip and the price is less if you buy it with the aquarium admission.",Amanda C
40,"Wish there was more to see, loved it!",We spent two hours inside wish the place was bigger but this place is well designed. The view points for their tanks was well thought out. Take the time to go feed the Lori keeps but only go in if the meter reads Very Hungry and go first thing in the morning. Eat outside the aquarium at several choice restaurants instead of in the aquarium food court.,Hawaiianbee
40,Recommend a visit!,"Great way to see features and creatures found in the ocean off California. I felt the building design was good, and the opportunity to feed a bat ray was fun!",thomasbones52
50,Training Sea Otters!,This place was wonderful! Never been there ever till our Anniversary. I didn't have a favorite but maybe the seal otter show. My husband was used to help train the otters and it was absolutely adorable. He loved it! Also the Sea Lion show was good. It was hot outside but it was bearable. Would love to go again sometime,Christine G
50,Visit your finy friends today,"Great exhibits, wonderful hands-on touch tanks. Great for all ages, but really little ones will become cranky after a while. Jellyfish are not to be missed.",Frugal_Hungry_Man
50,This aquarium has a lot to offer kids and adults,"I was not sure what to expect, but i was pleasantly surprised. There is a lot of different fish tanks to see. There is a lot of interactive exhibits, such as going to the bird room and feeding the birds from your hands or being able to touch the different types of sea animals in the shallow tanks.",Eric682014
50,Fabulous,"From Australia and staying on Queen Mary for a few days the aquarium was like a magnet, as we live on the coast and have a great interest in all things marine. We were not disappointed. It was good to see different fish and sea creatures that are not found in Australia. This facility was extremely well built and laid out for a good people flow to see everything. Loved the touch pools. The shop was awesome with so many replicas we bought to take back home, which we now have around our own fish ponds, giving us a reminder of a wonderful visit. Would thoroughly recommend a visit.",JennyWren6398
50,The displays are great and the interactive areas are super.,If you live down here it is a good deal to become a member. the displays are great and the interactive areas are super,373richardv
30,Typical Aquarium,The aquarium was overall good but they had way to many of the same type of exhibits. Many of the tanks had the same fish with a few different fish to make it look like a whole new type of aquarium. They have an abundant amount of different jelly fish which is great but I think they use that to fill in space. I hear it is always pretty crowded and when we went it was definitely crowded. I would say if your paying full price for each person it is not worth it. If you get a good deal than I can see it being a good place to take kids.,Rita H
40,Enjoyable Outing!,"Awesome aquarium! Lots to see and touch for both a seven and a year old. No one got bored. There are tables outside... so bring your sack lunches. After your rest break, take the nice loop walk to check out the lighthouse and snap pics of the view.",TamiF1011
50,Outstanding aquarium --- great for kids and adults alike,"This is a terrific (even if too expensive) place for family outings --- we went with our granddaughter and some other friends and spent about four hours or so. The staff is knowledgeable and helpful, the sea lions, otters, rays, etc., are wonderful. Our granddaughter (aged 3.5) talked about it all the next day....That said, it is very expensive unless you buy a combo ticket (as we did) that entitles you to visit the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles as well. Also, the lay-out is confusing (very much so) and the map is not all that helpful. Still, it was a most enjoyable activity.",Trup
50,"Otters, penguins and lorakeets -- oh my!!","It was a wonderful visit and so educational. The penguins, otters and lorakeet were our favorite exhibits. It was exciting to see the latest addition - Lily - to the penguin exhibit. So much to do and see at this aquarium!!",susan T
40,Fun visit,"Fun place. Had some interesting exhibits as well as the usual. I was a bit disappointed by the tube - the one you walk through with water all around you. While I didn't expect the floor to be see-through, I did think the top would be. But it isn't, so it was neat to walk thru with fish on each side, but not the full effect I thought it would be. On a par with the Monterey and Birch aquariums, but perhaps bigger - next aquarium will be the one in San Francisco.",BlondieOriginal2014
40,Always a Pleasure,"Go early. We were there shortly after it opened and could move about freely and get into the shows we wanted to see. Park in the aquarium lot and get the ticket validated for the $8 rate. Be sure to pet the jellies and the sharks. The otters and the penguins were our favorites. Watch the sea lions from the tunnels below the surface. It is awesome to see them swim by so gracefully and quickly. Good for kids of all ages. When we left around noon the hallways were so crowded you could hardly move around. We were glad to be leaving and quite proud of ourselves for arriving when there were no lines at the ticket booths and hardly anyone there. We got the half price rate because of a mailing we received, otherwise we probably wouldn't have gone again so soon.",bogeysue
40,Little aquarium,"You don't need to much time to visit all the aquarium,you can do it in two hours. Is a good place to the little kids.",Tatiana A
50,Amazing and Interactive,"Recently went to the Aquarium with my family and totally loved it. Situated in downtown Long Beach, right where they have the Long Beach Grand Prix and nestled in a corner of the bay where the Queen Mary resides. I can't even begin to tell you how wonderful thi place is for kids. From the Lorikeet exhibit to the shark petting, this place is amazing, and affordable! We loved it so much that we bought a family season pass. The biologists and volunteers are so friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable that making your way around is no problem at all. However, the best thing about this place is that they have added jelly fish petting this year. It is so remarkable that you will come away from the aquarium with a renewed appreciation for nature. Then, if you get a little hungry afterwards, there are a bevy of restaurants in and around the aquarium. We ate at the famous Bubba Gumps afterwards which was about a 100 foot walk away from the front doors of the aquarium. I've attached some photos. Thank you A.P. for a wonderful day with my family.",Caleab L
50,A very good aquarium,One of the best we have ever been to. Plenty of great displays on the SoCal Eco system. Get there early as it gets packed.,tom l
50,Good take,"Just loved the location, the inside plenty of space wonderful exhibits, educational learned about the local sea life",Ellie K
50,Great Hands On Exhibits,"We have been to several other aquariums and loved our experience here. There are lots of hands on touching which my kids love (sharks, sting rays, jellies, star fish/urchins/sea cucumbers, etc.) My kids were entertained and learned a lot. The only downer of the day was lunch, we didn't plan very well. I wish we could have packed it. We left the aquarium looking for a quick, yummy, local lunch. There were literally no restaurants close by (except chains like Applebee's which we didn't want to take the time to do with young kids). We ended up walking back to the aquarium and ate there which was fine, but always $$$ at a place like that!",CMitchell23
40,Great Place to Take Young Children,"I was hesitant to go here because of my feelings on Long Beaches parking policy, i.e. pay a fortune for the privilege of spending more money at the shops and restaurants. They actually make it reasonable to use the parking garage directly across the street form the aquarium; all day parking for $8.00 with validation. We started out with lunch at Bubba Gumps which is right next to the parking garage. Then it was over to the aquarium. We had our 2 year old granddaughter with us and she was fascinated with all of the fish and other sea life we saw; seals, sharks, penguins, jellyfish, and seahorses, just to name a few. Be sure to check out the outside exhibits; Lorikeets, more sharks, horseshoe crabs, and stingrays. The whole facility is larger than it seems from the outside, we spent 4 hours walking through.",Mzznlink
50,Definitely worth the visit if you're in the Long Beach area.,"Really nice aquarium with excellent exhibits for young and old as well as indoor and outdoor space.Kids will like the interactive opportunities like the petting tanks. Adults will like the various shows about otters and other guests which are informative.We particularly liked the ""jellies"" exhibit and the otters.Be prepared for crowds when it's hot as lots of kids/camps/schools seem to descend on it to keep cool.",Ben L
30,Not the best Aquarium experience,Having been to many aquariums in Australia and USA I am afraid that the Long Beach Aquarium of the Pacific does not rate very high.The best one I have seen in USA is in Baltimore and in Australia; Sydney's Aquarium both offer high class experiences: far better that Long Beach.Must admit I am completely bemused why they would have an exhibit of Australia birds in an Aquarium (with few if any sea birds from the Pacific).Too expensive. Needs a revamp.,qldflyer
40,Great exploration for Grown ups and Kids,"We go to the Aquarium of Pacific atleast 3 times a year with our Kids and guests. Its a replica of the sea life of Pacific ocean. Always feel like we spend the quality time exploring all about the sea life. The tickets are comparatively cheaper. It's by the port and you have opportunity to take nice pictures with your family. They also has a great parking for $5 just across the street.( Good place to go if you are visiting West Coast, and have atleast 2-3 hrs to spend. thanks!!!!",Josh P
50,Best southern CA Aquarium - Long Beach,"This aquarium is a wonderful place to see marine life. We went especially to see the jellies. They have penguins, seals and sea birds too. Parking is only $8 in the garage across the street w/validation. You can usually find discounts for the Aquarium so keep an eye out. They do great rescues there too.",lkstumm
50,Great Aquarium,This is a great aquarium in the area. You get hands on with so many things. A must see for children and adults,redbeauty58
50,This place saves my life,"We've practically lived in the aquarium for the last few years. Such a great place to bring the kids. They get to look, feel, learn and play about. Adults get to look, feel, learn and gain some sanity.Our favorite is the giant glass wall of fish and the interactive ""touch"" pools with starfishes etc.",m t
50,Aquarium of the Pacific,"I liked this aquarium very much. Maybe better than Sea World. Many different aquarium environments. One with waves, lots of jelly fishes, even a shark's egg sack. Lots of petting opportunity of jelly fishes, sharks, sting rays, birds, etc. Kids get a map that can be embossed at different categories of the aquarium. The employees are very informative and know everything about each creature. The parking fee was a bit pricey.",Spencer A
50,A staple with our grandkids,"We love the Aquarium of the Pacific! We live a couple of hours away from our grandkids who are 2 and 4 years old, so whenever we visit we look for something special to do together. The aquarium is at the top of our list. It's often very busy, but we've never had a problem seeing our favorite creatures and enjoying the very hands-on exhibits. They're really well set up for children with tanks of jellyfish and tide pool sea life to stroke and touch and informative and friendly staff on hand. Each hands-on experience has an adjacent hand sanitizing station so they're really looking out for everyone's health and safety, too. We've been in all kinds of weather, and I can tell you it's a wonderful place to be on a hot day or in bad weather too. We usually take a break for lunch at one of the cafes inside. They have entrees with every kind of preference in mind. Oh, and another nice attribute are the people you meet! We have met the nicest people there! With a mutual delight in the sea life, it's easy to interact with the people around you. Try to avoid the school and camp groups if you can, especially if you're there with young children; we found that there are never enough grownups supervising so the older children can get a little thoughtless and pushy.",Scenik1
50,Neat place!!,"The aquarium was a mere 15 minute walk from our hotel and conveniently located in downtown Long Beach. Although busy, the amount of hands-on experience with a variety of sharks, manta rays and jellyfish more than made up for it. Staff we're abundant and ensured a safe experience as well as providing plenty of interesting information about the animals. In addition, we were able to save money by taking advantage of the ticket pairings offered on their website to other main attractions (ie. The Queen Mary, Los Angeles Zoo).",Helen-Marie R
20,"Too busy, poor signage",Probably best for young children. As a family with teenage children it was pretty impossible to get anywhere near most of the exhibits due to huge numbers of visitors and kids pushing into the front. Some nice marine life once you got the chance to see it. A fascination with queuing to touch animals leading to long lines for some attractions. We found the signage a bit unclear around what to do next and what exactly was coming up. Some things seemed unnecessary eg buying food to feed birds (in an aquarium?). Disappointed the walk through tunnel didn't have a see through roof overhead. Lots of helpers not really seeming to do much. Shark layout didn't seem conducive to let a lot of people see it at the same time. Lots of children banging on glass etc but no staff to control them (or the parents) while loads of staff in the gift shops etc,reviewer64Uk
40,"Ambitious exhibition with a lot of animals, informative and diverting at the same time","Ambitious exhibition with a lot of animals, and Information about these animals. Children can collect stamps in an Exhibition guide, and there are a lot of places/(stages where children can do Special acitivies.",rio5678
50,Fantastic array of sea life,"Aquarium of the Pacific is conveniently located right off of Shoreline Drive in Long Beach. The building itself takes the shapes of the waves and sea in the architecture. Once you enter, the main hall greets you with entrances to the various exhibit areas and a 3-story window view into the Blue Cavern. In the morning, divers clean the glass and rocks inside the exhibits as the groupers and other fish curiously swim around them.* Travel tip for the kids: The Aquarium guide book has a scavenger hunt in it. In each gallery and exhibit, the kids can collect stamps. It's a great educational souvenir.Jellies are fascinating and they have their own experience at the Aquarium of the Pacific. Moon Jellies are a favorite. You can even touch these in a special touch pool inside the exhibit. Other jellies you might see are Umbrella Jelly, Japanese Sea Nettle, Unside-down Jelly, Comb Jelly, Purple-striped Jelly, Lagoon Jelly, Pacific Sea Nettle, Indonesian Sea Nettle, and Flower Hat Jelly.Southern California / Baja Gallery has 18 exhibits featuring animals ranging from Oregon to Mexico. Sea lions and seals can be seen both below and above water, swimming and playing. One of the younger sea lions can actually see through the underwater plexiglass and will come up to the glass to check you out. The Ray Touch Pool is available for adults and children alike. Using the two-finger touch method, you can touch rays and small sharks in these shallow pools. They feel like slimy velvet. Shorebird Sanctuary has a few wetland birds like Black-necked Stilts, Black-bellied Plovers, Western Snowy Plovers, Killdeer, and Ruddy Ducks.A new exhibit is the Southern California Steelhead Story. The Southern California Steelhead is part of the salmon family and reproduces in Southern California streams. Just like other salmon, they travel up and down the local rivers to spawn and return to the ocean. In 1997, this fish was listed on the endangered species list. The Southern California Steelhead is also an indicator fish, meaning that their survival depends on a healthy ecosystem. The exhibit shows the growth process of the steelhead and how we can help to maintain a healthy ecosystem for all of us.June Keyes Penguin Habitat is outside near the Shorebird Sanctuary. The penguins love to play and a few of them will swim right up to you along the glass and pose for some awesome photos.Northern Pacific Gallery explores the habitats found in Alaska, Siberia, the Bering Strait, and the Aleutian Islands. You can view more jellies along with puffins, and a touch pool with starfish, sea anemones, and sea urchins. If you time it just right, you can watch the trainers work with the sea otters. Some of it is playing but a lot of it has meaning behind it, like checking eye health and general health examinations. They are so cute and playful. After the trainers left, they were all rolling around and crunching on ice piles inside the enclosure.The Tropical Pacific Gallery is home to over a thousand colorful fish and sea turtles. If you happen upon the Mandarin Fish, it will take a liking to your camera lens and pose for you. There is also an observation tube that passes through the Aquarium's large 350,000 gallon tank. You can see sharks, sea turtles, and the underbelly of large rays as they swim over you. Iridescent anemones that look like night lights set the exhibit aglow along with more jellies whirling around in circles.",OCFoodDiva
50,Great for all ages!,We just went over the weekend with our friends who brought their 16month old and our other friend brought brought his one year old. We had a blast walking around and seeing all of the exhibits. There was tons of educational activities which will be perfect when they are little older... For now everyone enjoyed walking around and seeing all of the fishies.:),Nellie M
50,Never a dull moment !,"There are fish, birds, ducks, sea horses, penguins and more...OH MY....my favorite are the Leafy and Weedy Sea Dragons...they seem to just float in the water. There are also sea lions and otters. The many indoor 10ft high viewing areas give ample room for persons of all sizes to see into the large aquariums to watch the otters play, the sharks and colorful fish swim by and then at certain times of the day, someone in a wet suit enters the aquarium to feed the fish.Outdoor pools allow people to gently touch the small sharks, sting rays and some shell fish.The aquarium is divided into sections to show the habitat and fish of differing water types within the Pacific Ocean.There is also the aviary: ""Lorikeet Forest"" with the most colorful little birds who will come sit on your hand for a drink of the special concoction you can purchase before entering the double door safety aviary to keep the Lorikeets in, undesirables out !Upon entering the main building the first thing you see is the huge Whale above your head, giving you the feel for the size of some of the ocean's creatures. Next you see the 3 story Aquarium and fish of all sizes, types and shapes. From there you can walk through several different areas examining the waters of the Pacific ocean and the life therein. Currently the main exhibit throughout is the Aquarium is of Jelly Fish....had no idea there were so many different types, colors, shapes and sizes of Jelly Fish !!The Aquarium offers childrens' programs, even over nighters, whale watching and other boat excursions right from their dock. You can also take a leisurely stroll out to the nearby lighthouse and surrounding park. Beautiful sights and photos from that vantage point of the Queen Mary and the old dome which used to house Howard Hughes' Spruce Goose.aircraft.A great day to be had...lots to see and do. Even the gift shop is fun.....lots of unusual souvenirs and gifts !",Rebeka C
30,Kids and strollers everywhere,We took our 2.5 year old to the aquarium and he had a blast. We were there the day after Xmas 2014 (sorry ot takes me so long to write this review). This is a small aquarium however they had tons of exhibits for you to see. It was very crowded that we did not get to explore the aquarium and missed the show. People and strollers were everywhere. Parking was across the street which was very close. I thought the ticket to get in was expensive though.,Nikki
50,Fun!,"Friend came from Canada she absolutely loved it!!!The birdcage is nice!Not many food options, specially for kids.",Monica_VX
40,Worth a visit,"I visited the aquarium with friends and it was an amazing experience. The centre is broken down into sections eg sharks, seals, penguins etc Each of these sections have a member of staff who interacts with the public where you have an opportunity to ask questions and see the animals being fed. Ideal for all ages. The facts about each fish are all clearly documented on the walls beside their tanks.The aquarium itself is fully accessible for wheelchairs and disability throughout. There is also small cinema style rooms where there are short films running. There is a large souvenir / gift shop which has a vast range of goods. It's also quite reasonably priced.I would visit here again.",Jane C
40,Good time,A very nice experience. The displays were visually pleasing as well as providing information that made the visit educational as well.,Will B
50,Must see!!,I've been to other aquariums and this beats them hands down. Most diverse collection around. Child friendly. They have an atrium where the birds land on you as you hand feed them. Cool!!Actually visited may 2014.,Phych99
40,"Nice aquarium, but sometimes too crowded","I've been to this aquarium a several years ago and loved it, so I was excited to return with my kids. They have a lot of displays, and lots of interactive opportunities. The kids especially loved the touch tanks and the temporary jellyfish exhibit.We visited on a Monday. Crowds are good to an extent, because it means the aquarium is thriving, but there were some areas where it was impossible to see or interact with the displays. One area felt so packed with people I couldn't stand being jostled around anymore and had to leave the gallery. It's especially stressful if you have a little one who's a runner like mine and weaves through legs to get a better view and then I can't find them in the dim environment. (Here's a tip for parents of kids like mine - they have free id bracelets at the information booth so you can put your phone # on the back should they get lost).I thought in the past there were more docents around the exhibits to talk about them, but I didn't see one person this trip besides at the touch tanks. Maybe we just kept missing them?",dotfurio1
50,Camp Catalina,"This was our third or fourth trip to the museum. We always seem to go when we are in the area. Never disappointed. There's always something new and educational to see and the kids are well entertained. It was a busy Saturday afternoon and we had to park at the Pike and walk a couple of blocks. Be sure to validate your parking receipt while at the aquarium to save on the parking charges. Also, we bought and printed our aquarium admission on line so no waiting to get in--excellent.",Tracy P
40,Jellyfish everywhere,If you are into jellyfish this is the place for you. Very cool to touch them. Many kinds and sizes. We really enjoyed it all. We only had 1 1/2 hour to go through. Probably 2-3 would be better.,DeAnna H
40,Very educational and fun as well,"We went to the aquarium on our last day in California. the aquarium is small, (saw it all in about 3.5 hours). But don't let size fool you, the exhibits were great, very interesting and educational ( my wife and I are both in the education field ). We loved the jellie fish exhibits, fascinating creatures that are presented in a great manner for viewing. The location by the pier was also a plus, very nice experience.",Jose N
50,AMAZING!!!! A MUST SEE!!!,I just can't say enough wonderful things about this Aquarium! IT IS A MUST SEE!!! Well worth the trip!,Michelle S
40,Good spot to learn about the ocean and sea creatures.,Lots to see and learn about. Many opportunities to interact with the animals and learn about them as well. Helpful and knowledgeable guides. Exhibits are nice and not too crowded even on busy days.,Michael M
40,Interesting and educational.,"If you take the time , there is a lot you can learn about the ocean habitats. Unfortunately Sunday is probably the worst day to go, because of the crowds. They could improve the signage on some of the exhibits, but generally they were OK>",Bill W
50,Top Rate Aquarium,"Aquarium of the Pacific is a top-notch aquarium, and the admission price will assure you of that! But it is well worth it. Plan to spend a day as there is a lot to see.",AB4415
50,Excellent!,This aquarium was a pleasant surprise. Exhibits are well done and there is lots to see. Try to go early or late when large groups are not there.,JAW06098
50,Fun and Educational,Great place for a family. Tickets were affordable. The kids got to touch jellyfish and stingrays. We were there for a few hours but it didn't feel like it.,Dionnerg
50,"Excellent aquarium & experience, expensive","This is a fantastic aquarium! It's large, clean and very nice. They have a huge variety of animals and several petting tanks with jelly fish, sharks, rays, star fish, urchins, anemones, etc. Our daughters, ages 2 & 4 loved it and did not want to leave. For two adults and two children with a military discount, we still paid over $70, plus $8 for parking. It's in a great area though, right on the pier with lots of shops and restaurants. Highly recommend!",kmack143
30,It's too small but nice!,"The aquarium is full of a variety types of marines life and Its very appreciative to touch some of them(If you could get a good spot besides the pools). The seals and penguins are very cute and I took a picture with one of them.But I think its too small which I could just spend at most 2 hrs in it and I think it doesn't worth the price of the ticket. However, the 3D-Penguins movie is very interesting.There are areas which you may play around with water and you may prepare clothes to change and wear a flip-flop. Also, bring a camera to there as the Jellyfishes are elegant and there are a lot of them for you to take pictures.",tterry_hk
50,Can't beat it,"This aquarium is much better than the Scripps Aquarium in San Diego. There are several different coupons for entrance, all listed on the website. We got all our kids in for free with coupons from local grocers. The educational piece is wonderful--tables everywhere with helpful docents ready to explain. We like the Northwest Pacific exhibit, and of course the sharks and rays. $6 parking in convenient garage adjacent. Pack a lunch to eat along the marina. Lovely area of downtown Long Beach!",msjen141
40,Very nice!,Very informative and entertaining. Not only did I learn a lot but also enjoyed the different areas where there was a speaker.,Robert J
50,See the Sea Life,"I've been here twice and enjoyed both times. It's a little pricey for a family trip(~$30 adults and ~$20 kids 3 and older), but the kids loved it. They have plenty of tanks with a large variety of sea life including otters and sea lions. There are small penguins in their outdoor area as well as the usual sharks and fish. Beautiful location with plenty of places to eat in the LB downtown area.",CMT504
50,fun and see something new ever time you return,"BEAUTIFUL aquarium with so many fish, sharks, turtles,penguin. A must see if you are visiting Long Beach! Great place for children to see and learn about our ocean. Very cool sea otter exhibit, touch tank feel a mantaray, sand sharks. Parakeet aviary and beautiful fish large aquarium so all can see. Very nice theater with educational films and a cool gift shop that I must visit every time we visit the aquarium.",spfeismom
50,pet the sharks!!,"Beautiful, interesting exhibits and educational movies. Interactive, great way to spend a few hours.",Karen P
30,Nice to visit but avoid crowded times,"There is a lot to see and, for the most part, you get your money's worth. However, it was incredibly crowded with YMCA and school groups on the day we visited in July. It took a while to get close to see certain things. (And loud! Wow...a lot of kids create a lot of noise!) We hope to visit again during the fall or winter with the hope that the crowds won't be as bad.",chgo919
40,Great day trip,"Went there today. Exhibits are really great. Lots of hands on stuff for kids. The 3D turtle movie is animated...not even real footage. That was a bit disappointing. Lots of great live shows. They are short and repeat a lot, so you can really see a lot in one day. The staff was so helpful with suggestions and directions. It was very crowded with lots of camps, summer school groups, etc. Food at the cafe was decent. Salad had jellyfish on it. I passed and had the tuna and veggies. Decent! I did not see penguin 3D film...seems that may be real footage? The bird forest with $3 nectar was great. The birds will drink it as you hold it. My husband had two birds perched on him. Depending on your kids, that may or may not be a good idea! My granddaughter ended up freaked out and would not hold the nectar. Ah well. The touching lines were long but you could touch sharks, rays, horseshoe crabs, starfish, etc. Worth a trip. Get tickets online...the line was not moving well at all. Seems they were trying to promote buying memberships, and that was taking significant time to explain. We went to a machine and bought our tickets there.",Kathy K
30,Pricey but fair,It's almost $50 per person to go in.It's pretty crowded. It's small. Go early so you have time to go thru it all carefully. It's pretty small. But fun for kids. The seals are my Fave. Didn't really care for the sting rays. Since everyone and their moms are hurtled around them.,luxiouzzdoll
40,GOOD,We went with my brother. It was a good day. For the price I expect more. We are from Puerto Rico. My son playing with a penguin.,IVIS G
50,Fun Filled Day,"We renewed our annual pass, this is a great place to take the kids! We dress in waterplay clothes and bring a change of clothes and towels. Letting the kids choose the route and pace allows for a wonderful day. Switching it up with interactive hands on exhibits, water play, photo opportunities with ""animals"" and a lunch break = our perfect day. Scuba Cafe has grill style food and salads while Bubba Gump offers something for everyone. Yesterday we ate at B.G.'s and our five year old wanted to go back into the aquarium. What could be better than that!",Sailgirl854
30,It's small,"Came here around 10 am and we were done by 2 pm. The place is small and thank God I bought the tickets at work cuz it only cost me $20 per person. I don't think it's worth the full asking price because the place is small. Monterey bay aquarium is better or you might as well go to sea world.Tip: if you decide to go, bring your parking ticket and scan it inside the aquarium. Parking will only be $8 the whole day.",Jomama_Fosho
50,Great time,We love this place! Great for all ages. We took our son who is two and be loved it so much! He loves the interactive exhibits outside and the giant whale when you walk in the front door! He also loved the birds.,Katie F
50,Great Place!,"Almost didn't come here but so glad we did. The kids loved getting to touch sharks, jelly fish, and sting rays! All of the staff and volunteers we encountered were so nice and knew what they were talking about!!! They actually seemed to like their jobs and enjoy interacting with the visitors!",J W
50,Fun day,"thought the price was a little high but the sea life seen is great. Enjoyed visiting the aquarium, but if you have been in one aquarium you have been in all.",tinygoodgirl
50,A wonderful day,Thoughtful and educational exhibits and just a great day. Excellent value. I decided to become a member so I can come back and enjoy repeatedly. Must see the otters and play with the sea lions through the windows !,ptraveller1
10,Aquarium al about the money and gouging customers,"The people at the ticket counter need to get with it. They provided us with false information about how much the whale watching tickets were if purchased at the docks ($55 adult/$40 kids when they were $45/$30). In addition to this, they wouldn't let us upgrade our aquarium ticket (received as a gift) to a combo ticket, even though we were willing to pay the difference of the aquarium only to combo ticket price of $31. Spoke with a supervisor named Tyler and he was young, oblivious, and no help at all.This place is clearly only about the money and just gouging customers.",johntimothyhopkins
50,Fun afternoon event,"Spent the day with some family and had a great time. This particular Aquarium is not as big as the Monterey Aquarium but it is still a great place to visit. Lots of exhibits, lots of sea life, lots of fun. Went on a summer weekday and there was a whole bunch of groups but we got there early enough that it wasn't too bad. There is also a lot to do in the area and place to eat so if your traveling you can easily make a full day of the area.",Jedimasterkush
40,Great fun for the whole family,"Size of the aquarium is good, not too big that you miss things, not too small, get to see a lot. Price is OK, better with discount tickets. Shows are good. Great gift shop but prices are sooooo high. A fun little trip for the day!",missyaandfred
50,A good way to spend a long beach afternoon,Took the family to the aquarium and they had a blast! So many things for kids to do and small enough that it feels safe letting the kids walk on their own. I specifically enjoyed the jelly fish. Really close to all the hotels in the area and the park is very clean.,David M
40,Good for the younsters,Been here a couple of times on my trips to LA. Our daughter went when 1 and 2 and loved it both times. The shark nursery is cool and lots to explore with good seal/sea lion shows.,Nathan R
50,Sea fest!,This a marvelous attraction!I saw things I never knew existed!I especially liked the jellyfish. Display.,Saratown
50,Aquarium review,Great time here. Loved how the aquarium was layed out. Divided up into various locations by geography. Jelly fish were being highlighted on our visit.,hawaiianwoody
50,A fantastic world for children and adults.,The aquarium is spectacular. It allows you to touch the animals too. Great place to teach your children about the sea. Also a great place just to relax and watch the animals go by in front of you.,ScottHoag
50,A Must see in Long Beach,This is a great aquarium! Our 2nd time visiting it. So much to see you could easily spend all day or at least half a day there.,Fritz1637
50,A great aquarium,"This is a great aquarium. We spent most of a day there with our 2 kids and they quite enjoyed it. We have been to many other aquariums throughout the US and Canada, and this aquarium ranks right up there with any other. It has much more interactive displays and activities for the kids. They were quite engaged.",Aug N
40,Good for younger kids but very crowded,"First, let me start off by saying that my kids had a great time here and loved watching the penguins. However, I thought it was waaaaay too crowded for a such a small place. Luckily we got there kinda early (10am) so we were able to avoid ""some"" of the crowd.We were here for a family reunion brunch they were having in one of the upstairs outdoor room. The outdoor brunch location was very nice with plenty of shade and the food was good too (Hamburgers).The good:My kids love jelly fish from watching sponge bob and they were showcasing them in July.A small play area right before the shark lagoon outside allows the kids to play in water.The kids liked the puppet play and it was shaded...however, you do sit on rocks.The upstairs outdoor room we had was nice and the kids enjoyed the animals they showed (bird, turtle, reptile).The bad:This place is small yet I still was able to get lost because the maps they passed out confused me at first.This place got waaaaay too crowded after about 12pm. You had to bogard to look at the sharks and tanks otherwise you would be waiting a long time in the sun.There are no real lines and noone is there to keep people moving. Therefore some parents/kids will take a long time while others are waiting.Extra tips for parents of small children:Get there EARLY it is very crowded.I suggest going outside to see the sharks first so you can beat the crowd and heat.Watch the puppet show to take a break from walking or feed the birds to get out of the sun for a little while.You probably don't need a stroller if your child can walk (it was more of a hassle to park it everywhere since you have to walk up to the tanks).Don't be passive, tell the other kids when their time is up so yours can see also.You may want to bring some snacks.",Exquize
40,Pretty awesome,"I went to this aquarium for a birthday and it was very nice. There are places where you can touch stingrays, sharks, coral, sea stars, sea cucumbers and jelly fish. The aquarium seems small but took us a while to go through the whole thing. There's also a place where you can go in and see bird up front. Don't touch them cause they do bite. I bought tickets to see a 4D movie and I have definitely seen better. I wouldn't recommend it.",D M
50,"Great place, but don't spend the cash on doing a dive in the tank.","Very cool place. Great for the whole family. The educator-diver who speaks from inside the 350K gallon tank is humorous and educational. Once you see the tank and the fish inside, you'll realize how foolish it would be to spend $300pp to do a dive yourself.",sandidan22
50,Excellent Aquarium,"Great variety, really set up for kids and learning. Shows are excellent. We visited during the summer and there were tons of school kids volunteering with games and explanations--what a great experience for them, too!",AzBkey
50,Aquarium with great gelly fish and sea horse displays,"The aquarium is place for everyone. It has a great selection of underwater sea creatures as well as special exhibits that are very interesting. There are shows that adults and children can enjoy. You can eat there or get something refreshing to drink. The gift shop is ok. If you go at certain times you will see the divers feeding the fish. They have an awesome jelly fish display and the sea horses are not to be believed. They have the best collection of both. Parking is available but it's a bit pricy. No more than any place else, I guess. There is plenty to do after as you are close to the Rainbow Pier where you can buy lots of goodies. I always enjoy going to the Aquarium",J S
50,Better Than I expected,"Really loved this place. The inside aquariums were really very awesome and informative. I have been to three or four aquariums in the past and this one was by far the best. Lots of room to see everything, large aquariums and a helpful staff made it very interesting. I was wondering what one certain fish was and after asking a worker they looked and said they didn't know either. They disappeared and found a book and looked it up for me. It was just a casual question but they went out of their way to answer it.The outdoor area was really neat to. Got to pet sharks, starfish, Jellyfish, and a few rays. We spent more time there than i thought we would because at least in my opinion it is a must see spot if in Long Beach.",Allen M
50,Great place to visit,Aquarium of the Pacific is well worth a visit. Everything is well-kept and informative and they have some terrific exhibits. The kelp forest is exceptional!,LuigiNewJersey
50,Great Place To Take Kids,This is a great aquarium. It is by far one of the best that I have visited. There are many animals to see and the kids will absolutely love it. Make sure to allow a lot of time so that you can fully explore the aquarium.Just make sure that if you go on a special day to get there early in order to obtain parking that is near.,Valerie R
40,This is a very nice aquarium but very crowded,This aquarium is very nice but not nearly as nice as the Monterey Bay Aquarium. I love that there are inside and outside areas and many exhibits. The most fun for me was the touching pool where small sharks could be touched. I loved it. The aquarium is located near Shoreline Village and many restaurants and bars. The only problem was the aquarium was very crowded and many people allowed their children to run around and get in the way.,Littlegto67
50,Great for kids (I would imagine!),"This is rated No. 1 on TA and you can see why - very well organised, clean, informative and lots to do. As an adult, there's just enough to keep you entertained but for the kids it must be fascinating - so much to see, touch and interact with.",777pj777
40,Fun time and very educational!,"Family had a great. Fantastic. Great aquarium with lots to touch and see. Sea lion, sea otters, lots of fish and jellyfish. Best part in out opinion was being able to pet sharks!! Definitely recommend if you are near the long Beach area. $8 parking and lots of shopping all around.",Fernando r
40,Best local aquarium,"So although it's not the Monterey Bay aquarium, it's the next best thing here in southern Cali. Once you've entered and paid your admission, note that there are a few other ""add ons"" that you will have to pay for separately if you want to participate. E.g; feeding the Lorikeets, a 3-D movie etc. You don't have to do these activities, but they do dad value to your experience. All ages would find something to enjoy, although kids ages 2-7 would probably want to stay longer. There are plenty of local food options, so even if you don't make a full day of the aquarium visit, you can certainly make a day of the Long Beach Pike area as a whole, there is plenty to do and see.",Seashellstew
50,A world off fish,What a great small venue with a variety off fish. They also display some birds and otters and sea lions etc.. Been coming here with my kids for over 10 years. They still like to come even though they are in their teens. It is a a great local place to see marine life and especially the big aguarium in the main lobby.,Rich K
10,boring place,its a small placr to visit that the ticket doesnt worth it. its very expandive it worth olny 10$ or less . its very boring specially for adults. maybe they can make it free for adaults to take their childeren there and they just pay for childeren. i personally didnt like it.,Ani B
50,Very Kool,Very kool place to check out if you are long beach and have a couple of hours to kill. TIP i got my discount ticket on: http://arestravel.com/6526_attraction-tickets_a110.html,Sagar B
50,we'll be back,Elijah manger was very courteous and professional- made first trip a great welcome!! Just need to remember next time to pay at museum vs parking garage,Kathy V
40,Great time,this is a really nice way to spend an afternoon with children. Im not sure that we would have been able to spend the entire day there with our 5 year old.,Ira G
40,Better than Before,My son had just turned 13years old. We wanted to spend the day in Long Beach. To my surprise he wanted to go to the Aquarium. He loves animals and aspires to be a Zoologist. We had a great day. The staff was very interactive with us. The scientist on duty asked him several questions which he responded to based on his studies from his science lessons at school. I totally recommend all ages to visit. The top level hands on pool is a real plus. Much better than when we visited a few years ago. They even let you assist in feeding the sharks!,BBallMomLBC
50,Don't miss those Birds!!!,"This is a wonderful aquarium, large enough to have many interesting exhibits, but not so gargantuan that it takes all day. Parking is easy, and there are discount coupons and 2 for 1's available !",sinderella66

50,Fun for the whole day,"Spent the whole day there...wonderful exhibits. Got to touch a Jelly Fish for the first time. Was petting the sting rays, wow. Take the family and they have a nice gift shop - bring your cash because you will want to buy something. Also got to do the BBQ on the front lawn for the 4th of July, very nice and well prepared for the crowds.",holliewolf
30,Seemed small,"Was disappointed there was not more information posted. Most of the animals had a picture and a name but that was all. Doesn't compare with Monterey Aquarium, especially for the price.Tip: If you are attending an event at the convention center, the aquarium will give you a special rate. Be sure to ask at the box office.",KarenVenture_CA
30,Spontaneous visit,It was nice. My issue was after about an hour we were done. It's too pricey for such a small place. I mean they are right next to the beach the place could definately thrive from an expansion. Nonetheless the kids are entertained but then again their pockets are always empty,Diana
50,"Next time, I'll stay longer","We greatly enjoyed the exhibits. Our visit wasn't typical as we had a catered dinner there with the Blue Springs (Missouri) High School Golden Regiment Band which marched in the Rose Bowl Parade that morning. The 3-D movie was interesting and a little scary (I thought the shark was going to bite my face off). On another visit, I would spend a lot longer watching the sea critters.",Marsha G
30,Hoping for more! .. :(,"The Aquarium was first of all, hard to find! Our GPS took us to the Civic Center that looks like an aquarium from the outside (huge round building with whales and sea life painted on it! ) .. so we walked thru that first..But when we finally arrived to the Aquarium, it was small, boring, and way to pricey for what you see. I wouldn't recommend it at the full price, but if you had a heavy discount (60% off or more) and had nothing to do that day.. then ok!",Shannon411
40,Nice for kids.,"Very nice for young kids, is not very large but is ok to spend a afternoon in long beach. Not expensive. Good shows",Ricardo E

40,Beautiful aquarium,"Wonderful venue! The sea jelly exhibit is awesome. The only thing I can complain about is the ZILLION of kids there and the noise and ""tripping hazards"" that come along with them. I have nothing against children, but it was quite noisy and very crowded. I wish the Aquarium would offer maybe three hours of kid-free time once a week for those who would like a peaceful visit.",PCfan
50,Family Friendly Fun For Everyone,"My family and I love The Aquarium of the Pacific. It is well-planned, offers many different interactive experiences, and is a place to play and learn for just about all ages. There are many seating areas as you walk through the different ""cul-de-sacs"" that group the sea life by type and origin, so you can also sit and take a breather. There are outdoor pools where, for example, you can ""pet"" some of the animals. My favorite are the sting rays. They feel like a soft mushroom cap and will actually swim close to the side of the pool to allow you to touch them. The aquarium also invites different entertainment groups to perform. One time a Mexican children's group was there to perform folk dances and songs. There is a cafeteria, and the food is good. We like to stay until just before closing, then go across the street to Bubba Gump's for a seafood dinner. The facility is quite large and is on two levels, so wear comfortable shoes. Whether you go alone, with a partner, or in a large group, this is a place that offers something interesting and fun for everyone. The entry fee is reasonable, and you'll leave feeling you got your money's worth and then some.",Miztude
20,Little kids may enjoy some of the exhibits.,"Really in need of major upgrading, improvements, repairs. Today is barely a resemblance of it's past glory.",jwalk77
50,"Loved it, lots of interesting sea life","Really enjoyed this, lots of interesting sea life to view and touch. We had 2 hours but I think 3 would have been better. The parking gets really busy later in the day so allow time for parking. Not sure I agree with them selling fish in the restaurant, but that could be because I am vegetarian !",Ray C
50,Aquarium of the Pacific - A Great Way To Spend Half A Day,"While researching the cost for tickets to the Aquarium of the Pacific, I discovered a ""conventioneers discount"" on the aquarium website. The discount indicated half price admission after 2 PM. I stopped by the Aquarium the night before to ensure that this rate was still valid. I was advised that the rate was actually eight dollars and was good any time of day.I took advantage of that rate the following day. I was required to show my convention badge, which I did. The price is normally more than triple that, so I was pleased to save a significant amount of money.The aquarium is not linear, which gives visitors a somewhat chaotic feel when you first walk in. There are photo opportunities, a café, restrooms, movie tickets being sold, etc. It is a bit overwhelming as you first enter. Once you get past the initial ""noise"" of the entrance, it has a decent flow. Visitors filter through exhibits on the first floor exiting into an exterior set of exhibits that include a ""petting zoo"" where you can actually touch the sharks, and other sea life.There is also a Lorikeet exhibit outside where you can purchase nectar ($3) to feed to the birds. I have some reservations about this exhibit, because they put a laxative in the nectar to keep the birds hungry. It is an opportunity for intimate interaction with the birds, and I hope that some biologist has determined that this doesn't harm the birds in any way. But it still feels a bit wrong to me.After visiting the outdoor exhibits, which includes several that are interactive, you make your way upstairs to more outside exhibits on the second level. This includes some of the exhibits visible on the first level, from a different perspective. It also includes penguins. Visitors can then make their way inside for several more exhibit clusters that branch off the main passageway on the second floor.Overall, the exhibits were informative, entertaining and fun. It was sort of cool to touch the sharks...even if that exhibit seemed geared towards kids. While I had some reservations about the lorikeets exhibit, my overall impression was very favorable. There is a lot of attention to detail at this aquarium. I had a great time and the price was right. One of the ""not-to-be-missed"" opportunities in Long Beach. Although I would rate this second to the Whale Watching tour.",John S
30,Cool sardine fish ball moves,"They have improved the Aquarium since we had been there last. The coolest thing that happened was while they were feeding the fish the sardines collected in a ball, they way all the fish moved together was the best thing. I think it is a little pricey for what you get, but we had a 2 for 1 coupon which made it ok.",xiggyx
50,Great entertainment for all ages!,"I love aquariums and this one did not disappoint! Educational, multimedia, sensory exhibits, and a cafe. Would love to go back! My favorite was the seals and sea lions and the live scuba diver feeding the sting rays and other fish! The aquarium grounds were clean and easy to navigate. Worth the trip!",Baby-whisperer211
50,Had fun with the lorikeets,"We went here as a couple. It is a lot of fun to see any and all exhibits here but it is loud...lots of kids so expect yelling. Other than that everything is amazing. You get to see all sorts of fish and marine mammals and as the title states lorikeets, which you get to feed nectar to and they will sit right on your arm.",Courtney E
40,Really Interesting & Interactive,"This is a very neat place. You get to see a wide variety of animals, some indoors and some outdoors. You get to interact with several of the sea creatures as well. I recommend it.",pianogirl21

50,Great aquarium,"Although a tad small, the exhibits are great. Kids will love this place. Don't plan on getting any food here as it is EXTREMELY expensive. The shark tanks are fantastic, especially the outdoor ""touch"" tank. The 2 indoor touch tanks are also pretty good.",larylicious
50,Well worth a visit.,"We took the ""behind the scenes"" tour which was very informative and provided a real appreciation for the work and technology it takes to make a place like this work. The place was well staffed with friendly and helpful volunteers. We visited early on a weekday, which I strongly recommend as competing with weekend crowds or school groups will not improve your experience. We did not have kids with us but are experience grandparents and would recommend the aquarium to families with kid of all ages.",Lexie914

30,It's not Santa Cruz so don't expect to much!,"It's not Santa Cruz or San Diego so don't expect to much, it's not in the ocean, just a big fish tank, but it's fun for the kids.

50,A delightful family outing,"This place is wonderful for families with children of all ages. There is lots to see and the facilities for taking care of babies are great. The exhibits are interesting, the staff is very nice, and there are active things for young children to do.",Linda W
40,One of the besy,"I make it a habit to visit aquariums wherever I visit and there is one. Unfortunately aquariums need visitors to be viable and are therefore normally crowded. The parking here is good and reasonable by CA standards. The location, on the waterfront is great. Sharks, the day touch tank and penguins are some of the highlights. The leafy dragons were a huge hit with out 3 toddlers as was the talk in the big tank of the main lobby. We have visited before and have never been disappointed. Enjoyed this trip as well. There is chain food in walking distance and the combo tickets with the LA Zoo is a good deal and makes for a good day.",gaylordm
40,Best Aquarium seen To Date,Easy walking distance...lots of restaurants nearby. The exhibits were beautiful and very well maintained. Kids loved being able to touch a jellyfish. Half a day activity.Downsides: pricey and lots of field trips,Amy J
50,Loved it even though it was busy,I went by myself and half of the country to check it out. I love Aquariums and try to hit them up whenever I am traveling. This one was great. There was so much to see and they let you touch different animals which was pretty interesting. This is the first Aquarium I have been to where they let you touch the jellyfish. I have grabbed a few while diving but always had a glove on so this was a new experience for me. So much to see worth the high price for sure.,Pixtonian
50,World Class Aquarium,"Maybe not as well known another aquariums, but the Long Beach Aquarium of the Pacific is a must see! Great exhibits and many opportunities to touch or pet, including Sting Rays and Sharks!",DiverRichard

30,Aquarium of the Pacific,"The prices were so outrageous! We paid $8.00 to park and then 109.80 to get in for my husband, myself and 2 kids. We saw everything in just under 2 hours. Went on a week day right when they opened which was a good thing because about 40 minutes into it bus loads of kids came in!! I liked the otters and the shark area was small. they said they had an area where they take care of animals but it wasn't open to see any animals. I was looking forward to that. It was just okay. Wish I could of got a discount online or something because i thought just too expensive.",Christine P
50,Long Beach Gem,"We frequent the aquarium and find it to be consistently fun and clean. They also do a great job bringing in new life/exhibits. We always try to go at off times as there are a lot of field trips by schools and groups, especially during the summer. Don't miss the gift shop-great place to buy gifts, especially for out of town guests you may be visiting. You could skip the restaurant though-pack a lunch and sit on the grassy hill overlooking the boats. We love being a member there.",winepig64

50,Sharks Sharks!!!,"Its a pretty good size aquarium with lots to see. Interesting place for adults and children to visit. My wife and I enjoyed looking at the different sea animals and my 3 year old son had fun watching the sea otters, penguins, and especially the sharks. You can also take a walk to the lighthouse or get something to eat in any of the near by restaurants. If you walk to the lighthouse, you can also enjoy the ocean breeze, the sunset, and a nice view of the Queen Mary.",Carsgonnagetyou
40,Throughly enjoyable,"My wife and I (in our 60's) spent a great couple of hours here today (a Sunday) and we thought it was good value for money. As another reviewer had mentioned, Sunday's are busy and there is an issue with so many parents bringing buggies in. There is ""parking area"" for them inside but this can only take so many and I saw it was full, hence so many being pushed around. I think the aquarium should address this.Some of the exhibit areas look a bit tired but they must get thousands of people coming through. We went in at 11am and the glass you look through on the tanks were very smeary from hand prints. It didn't look as though they get cleaned every day which is a shame.Having said all that, the aquarium is really well layed out and many of the exhibits were amazing, especially the jellyfish.Make sure you grab a guide booklet (free) as you walk in. You don't get one when you pay fir your ticket neither was one offered as you entered the building.",KeithmT
10,Disappointed,"I've been rather harsh giving it just one star, but neverthess, I had been really looking forward to visiting the Aquarium and left very disappointed. The website did say it gets busy at the weekends, but boy! was it busy..!! Literally hundreds of small children running about - which was great and exciting for them (I DO have kids of my own!!) and pushchairs everywhere, which made it very difficult to see the exhibits easily. Very crowded, basically.The exhibits themselves, were in many cases, very good with a wide range of fish and animals to see, but in my view, not always presented very well. Large sharks are kept in a swimming pool type tank - so you cannot get any side view of them like I have seen in other aquariums with glass built walk-thru tunnels. And is it really necessary to touch the animals, as in the Rays and small sharks? They must get really fed up with it!The exhibits of jellyfish were stunning, however, and were the best varieties I've ever seen, however be aware that they are not just exhibited in the Jellies area, but in tanks all around the Aquarium.There were no staff around to ask directions. No Guide Leaflet is given when buying the tickets, which I was really surprised at, so you have no idea what to expect. I would have thought this was basic. I did see some people who had managed to get a guide, and eventually I found a discarded one on the floor, but it was at the end of my visit.... I have no idea where they got theirs from. I did ask for some directions from the staff at the entry but they just waved vaguely in the direction of the main jellyfish area, then just said ""go to the back, then work your way to the front"". Pretty unprofessional really. As I went, I looked around for the 3/4D cinema but couldn't find it, as I had bought a ticket for the 4D turtle movie. After an hour or so of visiting, I had completely had enough of all the crowds, battling strollers and screaming children, so decided to make my way to the exit. I finally found the 4D movie theatre and enquires about the next showing. It was 4.10pm and I had missed the last showing, apparently!! Why?!?! (The whole attraction doesn't close until 6pm). I was extremely disappointed - if I had been told when purchasing my tickets that that was the last showing, I would have made sure to be there. I was bitterly disappointed; the girl on the desk was genuinely apologetic,but there was not much should could do except refund the film ticket.So, all-in-all a very disappointing visit. For a truly authentic Aquarium experience, I would thoroughly recommend the Berlin Aquarium if you are ever in that city - it is a superb exhibition with a huge variety of sea creatures very sympathetically displayed.",kimski44
30,It's okay,I guess I had higher expectations. 3D movie was nice but had to pay additional fee for it. However the location is great. Was able to catch a redline bus to downtown long beach to explore.,76monkey
50,This is the best aquarium in the LA area.,"If you are looking for fun day that is interactive and enjoys beautiful views of ocean creatures, this is for you. It is well laid out, and you are given a list of all the shows, feedings, and other features with a time schedule so you can pace yourself accordingly. We enjoyed the diver feeding fish and answering questions in the main tank on the first floor. The kids loved touching the stingrays, sharks, star fish, jellies, and some things I don't remember the name of. There is a portion of the exhibits that were outside which I enjoyed. The gift shop was rather large and offered wide price range from really low prices (for the child that wants to buy something) to the more expensive.BONUS: Pick up a guide book for your child so they can stamp the pages at the various stamp points, so they can pick up a small prize at the end.TICKET BONUS: Purchase your tickets at a Ralph's Grocery Store (even the day you go) and get $7 discount on adult tickets and $3 discount on children .... very nice!ALSO: This is a nice area of Long Beach located in their business/downtown area and close to the cruise ship ports and Queen Elizabeth. There are lots of nice restaurants in this area to choose from as well.",calgal405

My favorite things to watch were the sea dragons, sea otters, penguins, seals and sea otters. I also liked the hands on exhibits - moon jellies especially.You need at least 2 hours to thoroughly see everything during a non crowded time. If you visit during a crowded time, you'll need at least an hour more.",mohc962
40,Great Long Beach Attraction,The Aquarium in Long beach is located right on the water near downtown and has been a wonderful local attraction for years. The architecture is beautiful and inside lay out features plenty of room to walk and explore the vast sea life. There are both inside and outside exhibits. Great location with restaurants nearby and the Long Beach Pike Marketplace at your fingertips. I recommend for anybody groups or individuals,Tyler D
40,Fun for adults and children alike,"I took my daughter, grandson to this Acquarium and we were totally fascinated by the selections. The location is excellent with nearby restaurants, movie theater and Shoreline Village. The kids love the petting part and for sure we will return soon. The cost is reasonable compared to Disneyland and other attractions in Southern California.",roydio1948
50,Fun and educational,As a teacher we planned several field trips to the aquarium and was never disappointed. The children enjoyed the experience and learned a great deal from the experience. We would do a unit on marine life before and during and finish it after the visit. I just love the seahorse and interactive things the children get to do. I enjoy doing them myself. I would really suggest this as a family outing for your entire family. Even if it is only a couple you couldn't doing something together you will remember this experience for years to come.,Sharlene V
50,Fabulous Day!,"We have been to this beautiful Aquarium in the past, but went with my daughter and grandkids this last time! It was even more wonderful than I remember! I noticed many more aquatic sights, the kids playground, the very friendly docents, the very large gift shop...many new additions! My grandchildren loved looking at all of the fish, participating in the hands on activities, and spending the day doing something new! Just a perfect day...always fun to go somewhere familiar again... AND a treat seeing it through a child's eyes!",Fay T
50,Kids HEAVEN,The kids are able to pet live sharks!! The seals were a great delight for everyone to watch. We got in on the Memorial day late night special. It stayed open to 8 and it was half price at 15 dollars for adults. The girls loved the jelly fish display and being able to actually touch the sea anemones,seetheworldmontana
40,Very Nice and doesn't break the bank,"I enjoyed this aquarium, great for my little one ! There are lot of ""touch the sea life"" exhibits which are always a big hit. There was a sea otter show, which keeps the little ones interested. I was impressed by how many different types of fish and jelly fish that they had. For the price I was expecting much less !",dawn2281
50,A family favorite,"The grandkids love going to see the sharks and the beautiful birds. Really. They like it all, but when they say that, we know where they want to go. :) The cost is reasonable, the staff is friendly and on non packed days, it's a really nice visit. On field trip days, it gets to be a little much.",chicachiquita
30,Holiday weekend crowds,"I would probably rate this 4 stars if we hadn't visited on a holiday weekend. It was super-packed which took some of the fun away. My favorite parts were the jellyfish and the shark petting area outside. My 2-year-old was fascinated by the sea lions and scuba divers. Be aware that outside is a splashpad area - the kids love it, but it could be a problem if you didn't pack an extra set of clothes because the kids get soaked. The puppet show outside was terrible so definitely skip that! Location of the aquarium is great, because it's easy walking to restaurants and boat-viewing.",Megan M
50,Wonderful attraction,"We enjoyed our day at the aquarium. Great exhibits. Great value. I highly recommend doing a whale watching tour. Even though very late in the season, we did see a mother gray whale and her calf. Amazing! Hundreds of dolphins. Would definitely do both again.",mccullars
50,It was a great experience.,"My dad took my sisters and I here for vacation last year and we had a great time.

30,A SoCal Alternative to Monterey Bay,"If you have a hankering for seeing a variety of fish, this place does a decent job. I came here to photograph them and there were plenty of photo ops. I wasn't expecting to see penguins and baby sharks, a nice bonus. It was also nice that there was a section where you got to touch an assortment of starfish and other animals.This isn't the same as the aquarium in MB, but my expectations were exceeded. Plus it's in a nice marina and within walking distance to shops.The downside is the crowds. I'd try to avoid coming here on the weekends, or try to get there early.",0garibaldi0
40,Nice aquarium,Great for kids and tourists. Not the best in the world but air conditioned and you can see it all in a few hours,Shelly B
30,Doesn't take all day....,"We killed some time before our whale watching trip by visiting the aquarium and whilst not unreasonably priced we found that we had seen the things worth seeing within just over an hour. Not to say these things weren't worth that though. I walk a thin line politically when it comes to zoo's and aquariums (I'm anti-Seaworld) as ultimately all animals should be free, but conservation is also important. The habitats here seem well crafted and large enough in most cases, the otters seeming particularly happy and playful, and the shark pools are a great experience however I did feel for them, having school groups of kids screaming down at them must be disconcerting....but despite my natural reservations the level of education here is high, and the keepers seem passionate about what they're doing.The whale watching tour we went on, whilst booked through a third party, ran with an expert from the aquarium, and she was very knowledgeable and the tour brilliant, after 2 hours in the rain seeing nothing, but then suddenly being treated to a grey whale and her baby, made all the misery worth it!",Elizabeth C
30,Ok Yet Disappointing in Many Ways - And Way Too Crowded To Enjoy!,"First off let me preface this review by saying we went on the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend. Normally my husband and I avoid all major attractions during holiday weekends because we hate the crowds....but....we did a stay-cation this holiday and decided to do a day trip up to Long Beach to visit the Aquarium which we hadn't been to before. We were disappointed. The sheer mass of humanity took away any enjoyment of the place, the volume of strollers in the small narrow viewing areas became so irritating you could scream. (And we have 3 kids and 4 grandkids so we understand the need...) What the Aquarium needs to do is mandate parking of the strollers before heading into the different ""areas"" of CA to view because its so over crowded already that adding in strollers to the mix is too much.Their are several areas to view for each part of the CA coast/area. All are nice enough however it all becomes repetitive because once you see 2 or 3 exhibits of jelly fish, or other fish, they all look the same. The penguin exhibit is small, the sea otters and seals are fun to watch swimming around - but again - you're fighting crowds to get up to the window to watch. There is an inside cafe and bathrooms and a very large gift shop.The shark exhibit was again disappointing. A few baby hammerhead and rays to pet. The new rainbow trout exhibit outside is a bomb. 2 or 3 tanks of small trout swimming around. Overall there are many things to see and several little shows to see as well but almost underwhelming because they all seem to be the same exhibits in each divided section. If you see one you've seen what the rest look like pretty much. The ticket prices at the door are $28 each per adult ticket. BUT....if you are an AAA member you can get discounts. Go to a AAA office in person and save $7. Or you can go online and download the bar scan and save $5 at the window. However...we tried to do the download but you still have to stand in the LONG LONG lines to get up to the window. After spending a short bit in line and not going too far we ended up using the outside kiosks (there are 2) and just bought our entrance tickets through that to get out of line and go straight in. The caveat of that is - no discounts allowed at the kiosks.Parking is a nightmare. Instead of trying to get into the parking garage go further up to the valet parking by PF Changs & Chilis. Cost $6 for the first couple of hours or so but if you eat somewhere and get your ticket validated its like $6 for up to 4 hours.Overall, its an ok attraction to visit, but if you compare this to the one in Monterey you'll be disappointed. The crowds were just too much - as in wall to wall people - so no fun. Cant even enjoy an exhibit because of everyone pushing and jostling to get up to the windows to see, kids crying and screaming, strollers taking up what little space there is...the layout could be so much better. But I get the feeling its like this all the time not just a holiday weekend.",thekansasgirl1
30,fun day but would not return due to price,"We took our 6 and 10 year old to the aquarium. It was a nice day, but I thought the price was pretty ridiculous. The aquarium is nice, but it isn't anything that we haven't seen before. We were all bored after about 2 hours. We ended up walking around the harbor area out front and walking over to the lighthouse and had just as much fun doing that. I had expected more, being that it's supposed to be one of the top two aquariums on the west coast. But like I said we got bored pretty quick and it was so packed full of people that we could barely look into a tank without being pushed out of the way. There is food available inside but for a ridiculous price. If the price were about half of what it is it might have felt a little more worth it to me. We'll save our money next time and go to the beach instead!",Shmetty85

There is a wide variety of sealife, fish, crustaceans, Corel reef, sea horses, etc.Very colorful displays. There were some stations were you could touch some of the sealife (jelly fish and starfish among others). They had helpful people explain what you were touching. It's definitely worth going. I suggest going on the the Whale watch and the aquarium (you can buy tickets for both together cheaper than buying them separately). I think we paid close to $100 for both for 2 adults. You also have to pay for parking which is usually $15, but you can pay $8 with validation from either place.",BurgerGus

While I was a bit taken aback at the price, each of us did really enjoy our time here. Because our grandson was only three years old and we had to get him home for his afternoon nap time we could not stay as long as we would have otherwise. Had we been able to stay longer probably the price would have seemed more reasonable. Possibly the management could consider half day rates (as is done at ski resorts, etc) in addition to their full day rates as I am sure there are many families in the same situation as us. There was a good variety of exhibits both in content and scale. Some places were indoors, some outdoors. Some exhibits were huge and soaring (the aquarium wall in the entry hall!) and some were small and intimate. All of the staff were knowledgeable and friendly. We did eat lunch in the upstairs cafeteria and were surprised and very happy with the large variety of food which was actually quite good! The cafeteria staff were accommodating and friendly as well. One can sit either indoors or outdoors on the patio. It was nice to have both options available. The gift shop is LARGE and very well stocked with again, a variety of items and price points. This was a fun adventure for us. Thank you Aquarium of the Pacific!",travelgirl93463
30,Long beach aquarium,"This was a good way to spend the afternoon at the aquarium, there was always something going on with a wide variety of fish and mammals. Great for kids and families. Glad we went.",Tweetyferg
50,Great Day Out,Having an interest in aquaria this please was fantastic seen fish I only ever seen on TVGreat educational section for the kids and Us Big kidsPlenty to do and see food is good and not too expensiveThey have s bird aviary out side be sure to get some bird food before you go in as the birds are very tame and will eat from your handAll in all had a great timeParking is a cross street and you can pay a discount ticket when you get your tickets,jim s
50,Love it,This is a small aquarium but has a lot to offer. Everyone is friendly and you get to touch a lot of different animals. We come over in the morning to feed the birds.,Jose B
40,Interesting aquarium,"The whole family enjoyed this aquarium. It is in a convenient site and there are usually discount tickets available in travel magazines. The touch tanks were great fun for all. There was even a band playing while we were there. We even ate lunch there, which was above average.",John W
50,Very fun,This aquarium has a bunch of hands on exhibits which are really cool. We really enjoyed our visit. The only negative is the extra touristy bits. Several places to buy souvenirs and food that felt redundant. Can't beat the location right on the water.,Denglerfamilyfour
30,not the best place,I went there with a large group the aquarium is not that big it is more for students.There is no tunnel where you can walk through and you see the fishes swimming above you and around you.I though there would be more things to see but it is not that great sure they have different species of marine animals but the place is very small.,koreageek101
40,Interesting site with lots to see,"I visited the aquarium before flying home to the UK. The staff were brilliant as they organised a taxi for me, let me charge my phone and stored my suitcase so that i could walk around which definitely beat sitting at the airport for 5 hours! Their are some very interesting displays but it is useful to pick up a map as it is a little confusing. I stayed for the shark feed in the small and large tanks which was really interesting. One thing I did like was that they have windows into the veterinary care centre to show how they care for the animals which I haven't seen done in an aquarium before. The staff were knowledgeable, friendly and ready to help. I thoroughly enjoyed it.",Gretchen Z
50,"Long Beach's Aquarium, a Treasure","Going to the Aquarium of the Pacific is always such a treasure; it's always a nice way to spend a day/afternoon. There are lots of different programs available for learning about ocean life. It's a great place for families to take their children/grandchildren to. It's beautiful and close to Shoreline Village and The Pike in Long Beach. Worth going to if you're visiting Long Beach and if you live here, what better way to spend some time : )",cmesign4u
30,This is an Aquarium?,"At first we were excited to see an aquarium that wasn't the same aquarium we've been visiting in Seattle for the past 25 or more years.The price wasn't bad after I found a $7 off qr code in our hotel.There really isn't anything interesting to see here. The layout is beyond confusingWe did find the ""Shark Touch"" to be quite cool. Other than that it was quite boring and very small.",CSwanson84
30,"I love it, but...","I love going to the Aquarium of the Pacific, and have been a fan of it since it first opened. However, I've never been able to go without a gazillion little kids, and I realize that it's an aquatic zoo, so I should expect that, but with all of the screaming babies and bored teens running around, it shouldn't have cost me $30 a ticket to see exhibits, especially when quite a few were closed for renovations. Will I come again? Of course. It's one of the few places I can see the leafy sea dragons up close.",crazytracy78
50,Private party,Attended a company event here. The staff was fantastic and the food was excellent!! The displays and exhibits were awesome. I will definitely come back to visit again during normal hours!!,42fireball
50,Underrated L.A. attraction with strong education support,"What a great way to spend a day. Not only are there great sea animal exhibits, the Lorikeet Forest is a great place to get close to beautiful birds. There are numerous touch tanks for both kids and adults to enjoy and there are some fun theater shows. Also, I've seen many school buses during the week where students that would not have the opportunity to learn about sea life and ecology get first hand lessons. Our family has spent many weekend days enjoying the facilities. In addition, there are great harbor boat tours nearby along with great food options.",JKang1962
50,Outstanding Aquarium,"Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, California is beautiful, educational, wonderfully laid out, an experience not to be missed. Have been going there since it opened June 20th, 1998 ----- terrific staff, great programs ---- always enjoy going back!!",Riversider
50,Great Aquarium for all,"If you are in the Long Beach area, I would recommend a visit to the Aquarium of the Pacific. There are numerous indoor and outdoor exhibits with a number that you can actual interact with the animals. My personal favorite is feeding the lorikeets, but you can pet sharks, jelly fish, starfish, and stingrays. My five year old daughter had a great time during our three hour visit. There is a play area for children outside that she loves. For me, this aquarium rivals the larger Monterey Bay aquarium. I am looking forward to a return visit with my family.",David B
40,Who doesn't love it here!!!,"A really cool place! Just really neat for anyone to go to!Go and take your time & relax!It is just that - neat & relaxing!!!So cool to see all the sea life, etc....!You will want to go & you will be glad you did!Especially on a nice So. Cali day...it makes it all the better & your day in Long Beach is complete!You will enjoy it! I promise!!!",hbsurfer1
40,Very nice but smallish,"This was a very nice aquarium but seemed small compared to some of the others that I have been to. I will say the displays were very well done. We were there for a reception so maybe some of the areas were closed to us, but I didn't see anything that made me go ""whoa..."".",Mary Ellen W
50,My Kids Had A Blast!!,"My kids really really enjoyed this place. They were in love with petting the sharks and could not stop laughing for some reason when they seen the scuba diver all decked out in scuba gear swimming with the sharks while he was talking to us. I ended up getting in for a pretty good price $67 for myself, my wife and 2 kids so I was pretty happy with the outcome. I found a really good guide that explains how to find the best discount for the aquarium and were to look. The guide can be found at the link below. I would definitely recommend this aquarium to anyone thinking about going. Make sure to get a good discount if your like me and don't like paying full price. Hope this helps others save too.http://rvonthegogo.hubpages.com/hub/Best-Aquarium-of-the-Pacific-Coupons-Promo-Codes-and-Discount-Tickets-for-2015-2016",justin j
40,Great Aquarium for its size. Lots of interactive areas!,"The aquarium had lots to see indoors and out. It was a gorgeous day so we got to take advantage of both. They have exhibits where you can pet a starfish, stingray or even a shark! Great for both kids and adults. Large variety and informative as well.",TheTexasTraveler12
50,Absolutly Amazing Experience,My family took a weekend trip to the beach to show our daughter and she said she'd like to go to an aquarium. We had a wonderful time and wished we had more time to enjoy. You could spend all day there. Very friendly staff. Highly recommended for any age.,wllmwvr
50,I got to feed the Manterey,It was a great place to enjoy natures creatures under the sea. The perfect place to take the family or as a couple.,Rita I
50,Perfect,This place is good for the buck you get what you payed for with nice collections of fishes. I would return and recommend to anyone,Austin_steve7
40,Great attraction if a little pricey when compared to other aquaria..,Interesting and vast collection of Pacific fish and mammals in large tanks and well exhibited. Not as dramatic as some other aquaria but very enjoyable and lots of photo-opportunities throughout.,neilmorris75
30,Interesting way to spend half a day,Amazing sea life to view and find information on. However I did find the Kookaburra and Magpie very sad as they were extremely obese. They are half that size in Australia.,BananaBec
50,Aquarium of the Pacific,We enjoyed this Aquarium very much. The exhibits were interesting and informative. This Aquarium emphasizes marine life education for adults and especially for children. We were there during feeding time for a couple of the larger exhibits. It was entertaining to watch the feeding frenzy of the various beautifully colored fish. My only complaint is the very limited seating and sparse show times of the Sea Lion/Seal show. There were more of us unable to see the show than the ones who got seated before the area was closed off. All in all it is a very good Aquarium.,jamandacam
50,Interesting and Informative,We had a wonderful time at the aquarium! The exhibits were fascinating and well maintained. We even took the behind the scenes tour which was the best! I would highly recommended this!,LarrJann
30,Bleh...,We had been wanting to visit the aquarium for quite a while now. We finally decided to go and we left feeling very thoughtful. Was this really the aquarium? Why was it so small? Seriously this place is nicely taken care of but it is very small. Not as as big as I thought it would be.I don't recommend coming here either,Disneymommy09
40,Nice Aquarium,"Even though it was Spring Break for children and there were a million kids there, I felt that the aquarium provided an educational and informative insight into both the local Pacific Ocean and the farther realms. It also addressed how California gets its fresh water supply which is so relevant to the on-going drought. I saw crabs I'd never seen before and learned about ""whale falls."" Even though there were many exhibits catering to children, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit there.",Jeanne M
40,Good,"This was a fun trip to the Aquarium. We enjoyed all of the exhibits. We did vacation here during spring break for florida but there was a LOT of kids here. We didn't mind since my wife is a Kindergarten teacher, which helped with the price of admission! I think it's awesome that they do that.",Ryan P
40,Good family fun,"I always take friends and family here, there are so many fish and underwater species.It is a good value ,for a day of entertainment. Also many good restraunt choices close in the area, Or just walking and looking at the boats by the water, beautiful location.",RObrae2014
40,Nice Variety,The Aquarium of the Pacific had a nice diverse collection of marine life. It seemed to me that most of the employees educating us were volunteers and only had some general knowledge. The Aquarium could use some employees with more expertise. Overall the displays were incredible and we enjoyed our time.,Sespetroy
50,Lovely exhibits! Fun day or night!,My Dad came out from Michigan for a visit. We were going to go on a whale watching tour but he didn't feel like being on a boat for hours so we opted to take a harbor tour and then go to the Aquarium of the Pacific.Both of us love to take photos. We have fun with the challenges of taking shots in an aquarium. The exhibits were beautiful. I think the highlight of our day was when we went out in the back of the aquarium to the huge cage where you could walk in and feed the birds. My Dad gave me the cup of nectar and I was covered with the most beautifully colored birds all wanting the nectar. I never laughed so hard! We had a blast and so will you!,BJLee399
50,Excellent as usual,We visit here every time we join my husband on a work trip. There is so much to see both inside & out. They have changed a few of their exhibits and it makes for a nice new experience. The only drawback is being there with school groups - definitely takes away from the experience.,jent123
50,Enjoyable visit,"This attraction was fantastic. There were hundreds of different species of sea creatures that I have seen for the first time like leafy sea dragon etc. the corals are so beautiful. Different kinds of anemones, seaweeds and barnacles were there. Saw small, big and different kinds of sharks. It is not too big so 2-3 hours would be good. If you will come here, check online for the discounted price like Goldstar. Great place to see and experience.",AJP242
50,Aquarium of the Pacific Coupons Makes it Well Worth the Price!,This place was amazing. Everything you can imagine that you wouldn't normally want swimming passed you in the ocean this place seems to have. I've never seen so many different water creatures in one place.Normally this place would of cost me $116 for my family of four but being the thrifty person I am I scored an awesome Coupon for the Aquarium of the Pacific from the Local Los Angeles CitySavver.com website. I searched everywhere for a deal for this place but couldn't find anything other than the kids free admission Denny's was offering.I ended up getting my whole family of four admissions to the aquarium for $68 Total with the discount from the CitySavver so I really couldn't have been happier with the whole experience. Make sure to check out the flash light sharks and don't be scared to pet the scary stuff like the sharks and electric eels. Normally I wouldn't talk anything like this but I opened up a little bit and I'm really glad I did. I would highly recommend the Long Beach Aquarium of the Pacific to Anyone especially using a good Coupon or Promo Code.Also make sure to check out the Local LA City Savver paper if you cant get one from the website since they also give out coupons for Aquarium of the Pacific every once in a while. If all else fails you can purchase an entertainment book but it cost $35 so it kind of outweighs the benefits.,Cody H
30,"Probably great for kids, so-so for an adult!","I have been to better aquariums than this. I think the kids would love it, but as an adult I found it a disappointment. Myrtle Beach & even Denver have WAY better aquariums!! Not that much to see compared to the high price to get in!",rowdygirl i
50,Fun,"Took my mom here for a day of just something different to do. We had such fun time watching and learning about different sea creatures. It was my bad that I didn't find out that it was the same day that 8 different schools were having their field trip there. Regardless of the added foot traffic, it was fun to see the awe in the faces of the kids and parents alike.",LisaDandSebastian
50,A Must See in Long Beach,"Without a doubt, the Aquarium is a must see! Take the time to walk through each room and look closely at the sealife. It is breathtaking and surprising!",Kim M
50,Impressive Exhibits - Get the App for Shows,"This aquarium is impressive. If you visit once, you might as well join, because you get a hefty discount on the behind-the-scenes tour. They also have free WIFI and their own APP, which you download/install. Other than the aquarium layout, they give you a list of demonstrations and shows that occur during the day. It is a bit frenetic, but it is possible to attend show after show after show ... from feeding sharks, to dive shows, to otter/sea lions. There are plenty of outdoor exhibits to go with all the indoor exhibits. Membership also saved us $$ on the movie offerings. The parking is $8, simple and right across the street. I need to come back to visit all the exhibits I did not reach the first time.",nygnyr
50,Excellent Aquarium,"We love this aquarium, it provides great education, many hands-in experiences and has ""Animal Encounters"" for members. It is a magical place!",independentthinker54
50,Wonderful Aquarium,Great Aquarium. Wonderful group classes and opportunity to interact and touch some of the marine life. Both indoor and outdoor exhibits. Loved the birds in the walk thru environment. Very clean and maintained. Great gift shop and friendly staff.,Disney4us4
50,"Beautiful, lots to see!","I don't know why it took so long for me to go there with the kids. The kids loved it and we bought the annual pass for a family of 4 in the same household. The pass is $125. When you walk in, you'll see a ceiling to floor aquarium. The kids are all over that, but there are more tanks as you walk through the place. There was a sting ray tank where you can touch and pet the sting rays. They looooove to be touched and pet. One just swam up to me and let me rubbed its head for a good 30 seconds before it swam away! My little 3 year old acted like she wanted to pet it, but when it got closer, she didn't want to touch it.It's totally worth buying the pass if you have nothing to do because one day admission for a family of 4 is half the annual pass price! The only day they don't open is Christmas and during the Grand Prix in April.",Janetsplanet
50,A must do in Long Beach,"Right on the harbor sits this very good aquarium. Lots of jellies, sea horses, anemone, with things for children to enjoy and experience. We saw many small children discovering the wonders of the sea with squeals of delight. A must-visit attraction in Long Beach.",Janet L
50,Great for Families,We spent the morning visiting the aquarium....very impressive. Judging from the number of families and children it is a popular venue. A wonderful addition to the city.,skychaserCalgary
30,Check your calendar first,"Should check their calendar before going. We went on a day that was extremely busy. Had my 3 year old nephew and had a hard time getting to see everything. Although given a map, was still a little confusing. Only found the outside by accident. Parking was also difficult as it shared with the restaurants etc. in the general area. If you weren't paying attention, you wouldn't see the sign that had instructions on how to pay the aquarium for the parking instead of the general parking. Membership desk girl was nice but still didn't get our cards right. It wasn't a big deal but inconvenient. We got a transferable card and she put the wrong last name on the card. We had to ask about parking, she should have told us about any parking deals. Also, did not mention anything about any cards for the cafe in the aquarium. Would like more information re membership benefits when signing up.",mooki x
40,A Great Place for Kids,"If you are staying in Long Beach and need something to excite the kids other than the beach, then this is it. The shows are fantastic, especially the sea lion/seal show. There are many interactive displays for kids to get their hands wet and touch the critters. The shark tank is pretty neat; there is a sawtooth shark that is quite a sight if you haven't seen one up close before. The overall place is not very large so you could plan on a couple of hours to see a show and walk the entire place. There is a large gift shop and small snack area if you need a quick bite.",mtngirl37
50,HUGE DISPLAYS,I don't really like seeing sea creatures being kept contained but I must say that all the displays seemed to be set up both for the people and animal FRIENDLY. Beautiful displays and set-ups; even had a very active (almost violent water action) sea creation for some of the sea life living there!!!Loved it;),GAMBEE4
50,Great sea creature exhibits,"I was very impressed by the exhibits in the aquarium. The variety of sea creatures is amazing!Being able to actually touch some of the fish, with plenty of washing stations around was very cool!",Dave S.
50,Family Friendly!,"Went here as a back up to going to Catalina for a day. There is Validated parking in the structure for $8 if you visit the Aquarium. They had quite a few sharks and large rays. Went on a Saturday which was full of small children, but that was what we expected. It is not huge, but a good size. They also have an out door area with birds and tanks and exhibits out doors. Overall really fun, only complaint is the flow around through the exhibits and tanks. Some of the halls seems small for the traffic, and there was a lot of chaos of moving through the halls.",Moto_Alyel
40,Nice place to visit,I enjoyed the aquarium and it's a great place to bring kids too. I enjoyed my stay in Long Beach and the aquarium is a great attraction for singles or families.,Lindy M
50,Great Aquarium,"Went to this aquarium and had a great day the older grandchild loved it lots of buttons to press. You could touch some of the exhibits although he was not to keen. There is a play area where you can let the kids let off a bit of steamWe found it very informative. The food court is what you would expect, suited our need with children.",DecerningLondon
30,Ordinary,"Expected something special in city like LA, but this aquarium is created for small children no adults. You can tuch jellyfish, small sharks and rays, but except this , nothing really interesting. Some kind of very small aqua zoo. Surrounding is nice, and opposite anchore Queen Marry.",Dudka14
40,Very hands on,"Ill start off by saying, its a bit overpriced, and a little small. Other than that Ive been a few times and it is very fun. Very informative and pretty awesome to be able to pet baby sharks, rays, and other sea animals. Location is awesome! lots to do around there. You can walk to Shorline village, and there are plenty of places to eat and have a few drinks.",onree317
40,Touch and experience,"They have lots of touch exhibits- sting ray, jellyfish, star fish. The coral and selection of fish are beautiful. The penguins and mammals are cool too.",Melissa-Sue J
40,Nice exhibits,"The aquarium is beautiful and a must see for visitors to the area, especially if you are traveling with children. There are hands on exhibits and shows that run several times each day. The penguins were my favorite.",MBart
40,Wonderful 4 hours,"I took my two year old expecting to spend 1-2 hours with his short attention span, but he loved it! First off, parking was $8 in a covered garage a short walk from the entrance. Be sure to take your ticket with you. Perhaps he was still waking up, but my son didn't seem too interested in the first couple tanks with very large and interesting fish. He livened up when we went outside and fed nectar to the lorikeets, beautiful multi-colored birds about the size of a standard blue jay that land right on your hand to drink the nectar. My son just lit up with delight over this and we hung around well after our nectar was long gone. We then went to the shark and ray pools where they allow you to gently touch the fish. This again was a big delight for my son until one of the rays splashed right in front of him. He got a little scared but quickly recovered and wanted to go back. You can also touch horseshoe crabs, which aren't nearly as interesting but still nice to do. I can't say enough about how great their tanks are. Very well done with nice lighting and beautiful fish and invertebrates. Some truly amazing creatures here. The mammal displays are very good too and my son probably got his biggest thrill out of watching the sea lions play. They were coming right up to the glass and he just laughed out loud. Priceless. We went on a Saturday and it was a bit crowded, but not terrible. Had I been alone I would have loved to have read the information on all the tanks. I would say you can comfortably do it as an adult in three or four hours. Food is available on site and it appeared to be the standard amusement park fare, though the fried chicken fingers and fries looked pretty good. Overall it was a great day and since we are local we will likely return in a month or two. I paid $29 as an adult and kids under 3 are free. Not cheap but not bad either and they do good work there as well so your money is going to a good organization. I've been to the Monterey Bay Aquarium in Northern CA, which is probably the gold standard for US aquariums and I would put this one right up there with it.",HeathCalabasas_CA
50,Gem in Long Beach but a little pricey!,"We drove to the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach from Newport Beach. It took about 30 minutes.We enjoyed the Aquarium. Our group consisted of two seniors, three adults and 2 toddlers. The cost was $138.00. That is a little pricey!! There is a parking facility there and parking is $8.00.There are a lot of great exhibits and hands on things for children. Our 15-month old granddaughter was frightened of the displays of large fish. She couldn't understand that they wouldn't get out!It makes for a wonderful outing. Many other things in the area to do but we didn't do anything else because it was nap time!Aquarium was nice but a little expensive!",Margaret B
50,One of my favorite things to do,"I LOVE this aquarium.They have beautiful fish and marine animals.I recommend actually reading about the animals and fish, some great facts.The whole aquarium is not huge so it won't be an all day event, but you will see a lot of neat things.They have students go there during the morning hours as field trips so it might be a little crowded then.They do have a food court kind of area where they sell corn dogs and hamburgers I believe, but I would double check on that.The best part is that its right by the beach. If you cross the street you will see a number of restaurants and the ocean!Its perfect for a date or with your kids. I feel a certain connection to the ocean every time I go there.Kids and adults love it",Margarita S
50,Always Something New,"This is a fantastic outing for a family, a group or just you! Much to see and learn. You can have a snack at the snack bar or a full meal at the restaurant inside. There is a great gift shop with merchandise for all ages.",Judy H
50,Fun quick trip,"This is a really fun aquarium that doesn't take a lot of time. There's plenty to see and it only takes a few hours (as long as you're not reading everything at the exhibits). Lots of hands-on experiences with lines that aren't too long are fun for folks of all ages. I've come here with small children, teens, and on a date. Every trip was exciting and enjoyable. Come later in the afternoon as there are lots of school trips and small children during the day. Staff is friendly and the whole place is really clean. Parking is a pain and there's a bit of a walk, but the area is really nice to walk around anyways!",EqLiu
50,Good Job,"When we heard that we were getting an aquarium here in Long Beach, we were excited and apprehensive at the same time. Being big fans of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, we weren't sure they could pull it off. But they have done a wonderful job. It is smaller than Monterey's, but only in size. The place has a heart and soul as big as the ocean they share. Get there as soon as the doors open and you can usually spend an hour or two relatively uncrowded. If you like aquariums, I urge you to check it out.",Ron D
50,Great for kids of all ages,They offer free classes in gardening and local plants. The aquarium is pretty good sized and you can sit outside and enjoy the sunshine. Right on the ocean! Just avoid the times when kids are out on break!,Lora R
50,An important asset for Long Beach,"For the most part, after living in Long Beach for four years, we have learned that this city is nothing more than a collection of bars and restaurants--and not much more. Except for their aquarium. I have been to many of the weekly scientific presentations sponsored by the aquarium. They are always well-presented and well-documented. This is a first class facility supporting some serious researchers. Everyone should to visit the aquarium. You can skip the rest of the city.",Andy H
50,2nd Only to Monterey Bay Aquarium,"We've been to this aquarium many times and still enjoy it! altho Monterey Bay Aquarium is larger and possibly more prestigious, I think you're able to enjoy this aquarium more as it's smaller and can lilnger over the exhibits without feeling rushed. both staff and docents are great and can really make a difference in your visit. This really is a ""don't miss attraction"" when in Long Beach.P.S. : Parking structure is very close to attraction.",SoCalRetired

40,Nice Little Aquarium,"The Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach is a good place to take young children. We have taken our grandchildren there several times. The aquarium is smaller than other aquariums. Admission is pricey, if you can get a discount to get in, then it makes it worth the money. Definitely a fun place for children.",t100baker
50,Fun few hours for a date,There are some great exhibits and unique sea life. The outdoor and indoor exhibits are laid out nice but get the map as some areas are tucked away.,shipdad
40,Nice way to spend a few hours in Long Beach,"Even though this aquarium isn't huge, they have done a very nice job with exhibits, touch tanks, and educational outreach. Theirs shows/talks are informative and fairly brief. While it is not a place to spend the whole day, it is a great place to spend some time. The surrounding area has a lot of good restaurant options and a nice harbor/marina area to walk around.",kurin
50,Educational and fun,"The place is not as big as sea world. However, there are a lot of cool underwater creatures. Very good learning opportunities for adults and kids.",coolden
50,"Enjoyable for any age, especially the sharks","The Aquarium was a great way to spend the afternoon. I was there for about 3 hours and throughly enjoyed it. The tanks are beautiful with a wide variety of specimens. They jellyfish were incredible. So relaxing to watch them and the rest of the collection. The sharks and rays are a real crowd pleaser. The Lorikeet Forest is a lot of fun to see the birds play, chatter and to feed them. There are a lot of interactive activities and hands on things for any age. The 3 story aquarium is stunning to see.",William T

50,Amazing for a free night!,"On fridays from 6pm-9pm the aquarium has a free shark and manta ray petting! It's great, I actually had one shark spun around my hand. There's other things to pet but those are the least shy. Great places to take pictures to. And when you leave they actually give you a 5 dollar off coupon to come back to the inside of the aquarium!",Mmmmm_13
50,Hall of Echoes,"This is an amazing facility with tremendous attractions/exhibits. You can tell that careful consideration went into every aspect of the aquarium. The only slightly negative thing I could say is that there is quite an echo throughout. So, if there are school groups or it is very crowded, you might not like the noise. But it would be a shame to miss the Aquarium of the Pacific due some anticipated noise. I keep going back to see favorites and ones I haven't seen before. It's a treat.",Tammy A
50,A great place for families.,My grandchildren love this place. The 7 yr. and under children love touching the Sharks. The sea lions are also fun to watch. There is a wide variety of aquatic animals to amuse most people. A beautiful kelp forest tank about two stories high is the centerpiece of the exhibit hall.

The exhibits are beautifully chosen, well presented and the whole facility is wel lmaintained and , well fun !Even the cafe sells freshly made food at good prices.The little children attending at the same time as us seemed thrilled by the excellent facilities.Strongly recommend the optional Whale watching boat cruise too. Amazing value and yes we saw whales !A wonderful value half day exchibit.",Ormstein
30,Mediocre yet available...,"Small, well-organized, though certainly not a destination aquarium. (By comparison, the aquarium in Monterey, CA is a worthy destination, plus is state of the art and extremely impressive!) Back to The Aquarium of the Pacific...If you are desperate for wildlife, more specifically, sea life, do come, especially if you have limited aquarium experience. They do try hard and there is some variety of critters (including birds) and ample learning experiences. It is, however, all Long Beach has to offer.",Dorbaja
50,Afternoon fun,We bought with our Queen Mary tickets. It is a very well run and entertaining facility. Worth the admission. A great afternoon!,DonMcKay
40,Nice visit,"We visit this place because a friend recommend to us, it was very good and all the areas are organize and very good information of all the small details",Ginavm7
40,Amazing aquarium - horrible crowds,This aquarium is beyond amazing. The variety of fish and exhibits are some of the best I’ve ever seen. It’s much bigger on the inside then it appears from the outside. I went on a Sunday afternoon and it was uncomfortably crowded. I have been there once before on a weekday and it was much less crowded. This aquarium should not be missed just be sure to go on a weekday.,bradygalpal
50,Love the accessibility!,"I was in Long Beach visiting my uncle with my mom and grandma in December. We decided to go to the Aquarium of the Pacific one day because I read on their website that they had wheelchairs at the information desk. I love that they do that! My grandmother doesn't go many places because she gets exhausted easily (and is too stubborn to have her own wheelchair). She was already tired when we reached the info desk, but once she got in the wheelchair she was fine. She had such a good time, especially looking at all of the colorful tropical fish. Everyone really liked lorikeet forest. Prices were reasonable too. We got the Queen Mary package and I thought it was a good deal. Overall, everyone had a great time, the exhibits were great, and it didn't cost a fortune. I recommend the gift shop there as well. There's a big selection of nice souvenirs.",AnaOceanState
40,Wasn't expecting such a great aquarium!,"We loved our visit. Saw such a variety of colorful and quite strange sealife. Great for kids, petting stations for starfish, stingrays and sharks. The lorikeets were neat to interact with.",bfh195
50,Place for the kids,"I've been to this aquarium few times and I love it.Kids were very excited to see all the sea creatures.We got late nights during holidays. Next time I would come earlier in the morning instead. We hardly could see sharks in a big tank.Touch tanks are very cool(rays and bamboo sharks, jellyfish). Now kids know how slimy they are!",ArtRussianMom
50,Wonderful Aquarium,"Displays of different Ecosystems. Loads of hands-on. Pacific oriented. Large fish tanks with varieties of fishes, sharks.",Judyb19
40,Pretty neat!,"There were 5 of us that went to the aquarium; 2 adults, 1 teen and 2 seniors. The parking was really nice, right across the street from the aquarium. They validate your ticket so it's 8 bucks to park. We went the Tuesday after Christmas and boy was it crowded! I am thinking over crowded. I really appreciated them having ample wheel chairs to check out for free as I needed one for my father. It is a different experience pushing someone in a wheel chair around a crowded aquarium! There were a lot of people that were very respectful and gave my dad some room to see but there were an equal amount that didn't. Parents would allow kids to stand right in front of my dad, even though we had gotten the space. Kids would literally climb over his feet... So that was disappointing and something handicapped people should be aware of.Overall, I thought the amount of fish to see was impressive. I live in Seattle and our aquarium is quaint compared to this one. They had several areas that you can touch and feel. I thought that was neat. All the displays were sparkling, clear and very clean. I liked that, shows a pride in the facility. Would I go again, probably not. I did think it was pricey but if I lived in the area and had small kids I would most definitely do a membership. There is a lot of learning to be had here. (I home schooled so that is one thing I always think about)",DianeRenee
50,Interactive fun for little kids and adults,"Love this aquarium. Loved it before I had a kid and love it even more now that I have a toddler. This aquarium has many exhibits where kids can touch sharks, anemone, sting rays, fish, and see all kinds of critters up close and personal. We love the lorikeet forest, when you purchase the bird food ($3), they perch on your hands as soon as you enter! I love the different kinds of jelly fish. I think the aquarium is run really well and the staff is always knowledgeable and friendly. The membership options are great deals if you can frequent this aquarium. In the last year, we have visited 5 times.",hgmadventure
30,Should be half the price,"While there are a couple of items worth a few minutes of your time, the aquarium as a whole is underwhelming. Save your money for something else.",GreatTraveltime
40,Great place for the kids!,"My older daughter and I have had an annual pass here for many years. We loved this place. Lots of stuff to see indoors and outdoors. My daughters favorite part is watching the scuba divers feed the Sharks and the touch tanks. Very educational. The only bad thing I'd have to add is that it's hard to find a day when it isn't overly crowded. Very stroller friendly. And I love that once we're done with the aquarium, there are tons of things to do in walking distance... Restaurants, whale watching tours, etc.",CAtoTXFamOf4
40,Couple of hours worth of fun,"Christmas Eve we visited with a range of ages from 3 to over 70's. Something for everyone including a 4D cinema though my 10 yr old niece states it was only 3D!! There is plenty of space both indoor and out, there are touch pools including touch jelly fish. The bird enclosure was fun with the birds landing on heads/shoulders etc. the sealion show was the only let down with half of our party being seated facing an empty dry section whilst the 'show' was obviously done in the pool area.",Ozziebd
50,Excellent aquarium...,"Just 20 minutes from Disneyland, this aquarium is worth a visit. This has the greatest group of touch tanks we have seen, including small hammerhead sharks, spotted sting rays, horseshoe crabs and moon jellyfish. There is a Lorakeet exhibit where you can feed the birds ($3 per person) as well as a shark exhibit, penguins and seals/sea lions. The ""deep ocean"" section is particularly interesting. All in all, one of our favorite aquariums to visit. This is in a nice location near a harbor and restaurants and shops as well. My kids, ages 14 and 11, really enjoy coming here when we are in town for Disneyland.",Carla G
50,Great aquarium and whale watching tour combo,"We purchased advanced online tickets for a combination aquarium entrance and 3pm whale watching boat cruise. The aquarium was fascinating, with lots of interactive exhibits and touch tanks. The staff supervising the touch tanks were friendly and enthusiastic with the kids, and extraordinarily patient. We would skip the bird-feeding next time - the lorikeet nectar is $3 for a tiny amount, and the lorikeet's are pretty aggressive (flying into my daughters' hair or shoulder and not leaving) and they poop on people. But everything else about the aquarium is really well-done.The whale-watching cruise was terrific. You may want to line up for it early (even a half hour before the scheduled departure, there was already a line), but regardless, the boat had plenty of room. Everyone tried to get as seat outside, and although there wasn't room for us outside, we sat indoors (which turned out great since it was chilly) and went outside to stand near the front railings when we were near the whales, or enjoyed a great view from inside. They allow you to bring a stroller onboard, but it must be left indoors. Bring a warm sweater our jacket, because it gets chilly. The boat is large and it was a pretty calm ride. The announcer was friendly and very receptive to whale questions from my kids.",Familytravel12
10,Waste of time,"I am SHOCKED at the other reviews of this ""attraction"". What a rip-off! This aquarium sits ON the Pacific Ocean and manages to be boring.......the building is built int he shape of a fish.. The architect clearly didn't think about how people would USE it.. There is so much useless space. There are only a few real attractions --- the penguins are always fun. I spent $100 for a family of 4 and we spent only 2 hours there......,There are much better aquariums around. This one doesn't deserve to align itself with an entire ocean!Try the New Jersey Aquarium in Camden, NJ. It is better laid out, has more things to see AND is cheaper!!!",adobin
50,WOW!!!,Touch the sharks and jellyfish explore different marine ecosystems explore 1000 feet down on the bottom of the ocean while you are standing on dry land. This place has got it going,Rick. S
40,Fun interactive day,The aquarium of the pacific is a very nice aquarium and is a great place to spend 3-4 hours seeing a good variety of sea life. The staff has a lot going on while we were there. The interview of the scuba divers and diver interaction with the fish and the visitors was very entertaining. Get you parking validated for the aquarium rate and stay around afterwards to enjoy the many other sights and eating options within walking distance.,Keith74006
50,A-maz-ing Aquarium!,"Me and my husband visited the Aquarium on our honeymoon. We noticed it was a very popular place to visit so on the last day of our honeymoon; we decided to visit! We paid just under £20 each - by that I mean in GBP. Very good value for money we both thought! We arrived about 930am and we could have honestly stayed here all day! We made our way to see the Sea Lions first - there are various shows you can see whereby you can get more information on the different animals and fishes. The best thing for us both were the touching pools - they were ace! The touching pools had sea urchins, sting rays, sharks and sea anemones! Whilst the majority of people there the day we visited were kids; the Aquarium is fun for adults too! Make sure you can spend a good 3 hours there - there is so much to see! Me and my husband would have liked to have spent more time there - we spent a little over two hours there but then we had to leave due to our flight home! All in all; I would definitely recommend a visit to the Aquarium!",EmstarManchester
50,Under the sea,"I love this aquarium. I am a nature lover so I could go here monthly and be just as thrilled every time. It is quite pricey, at $25 for an adult. If you buy your tickets online in advanced you can save $5. When you walk in they'll hand you a booklet, make sure to look through it. There is a guide and also spots to stamp when you get to certain locations. Very entertaining for kids, but I love it as well. They have tanks to pet sharks and stingrays. There are inside shows and also shows with the animals. Don't miss a great photo opt while feeding the Lorikeets.",Melissa Salazar
50,Good family fun!,This was the second time I've visited the Aquarium of the Pacific. It's in a convenient location with ample parking. It's perfect for the whole family.The staff and volunteers are knowledgeable and personable. They eagerly shared what they know in a down-to-earth way. I can feel and hear their passion for their work. I particularly enjoyed visiting the lorikeet forest. It's quite fun to watch the divers feed the sharks as well.,Monkeyed
40,It was ok,It was ok. Nothing too spectacular. Busy as heck. The sea lions and otters we're really cool to see but that's about it. All the other animals looked miserable.,Steelerspgh
20,If you have been to other aquariums you have seen this one.,Was very disappointed in the displays. Nothing truly focused on the special sea life of Southern California. I could have seen much of the same and more at the Atlanta Aquarium. Price for admission was very high compared to what you saw. If you have children they will enjoy the trip - if you are an adult and have been to other aquariums - forget it.,Hicks3456
50,Very impressive aquarium,I was visiting with my son and his family in Southern California and he suggested that we go to the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach. I had been by it before but this was the first time I actually visited it. I thought it was very nice. There are a lot of things to do there. You can see all the exhibits and watch divers in a big tank with the fish. There are hands on activities and shows at different times. If you have a family it is a good family activity.,Happyvacationer49
30,Really average,"We arrived here at 4pm and it closed at 6 we were hoping to rush it and finish in two hours but should have taken warning from a father who asked if it was still worth going in and the staff said plenty of time, Well we were out by 5pm. it really was not worth the trip from central LA if you have been to a half decent aquarium before (Melbourne for example), however this would be great for kids who have not ever been to an aquarium.We really expected to be blown away but while the displays were great that were there we felt it was much to small.",Rori M
40,Medium sized but complete value,We visited the aquarium late in the afternoon and enjoyed it without spending the entire day there. All in all. A good experience and value for the money,MinicooperIII
40,Fun & Exciting for Adults and Kids,Lots of cool displays of fish and sea creatures. Many 'hands on' pools so you can touch and feel what some of the sea creatures/fish feel like. Staff was very knowledgeable and courteous. You can spend almost a whole day there or just breeze through.,lhwashere

50,A Well Kept Ocean Treasure..............,"We have read in detail, about getting there when it opens up, or after 3 p,m,, and we chose to be there at 9 a.m. We had purchased tickets at AAA, which made our entry that much easier.Greeted by 2 Aquarium workers, who thanked us for coming (we told them that we were from Pennsylvania), and they kindly pointed us in the right direction.Easy parking lot location, and a short walk to the entrance. And that is where the fun begins. Our suggestion is to first walk straight ahead to the 2 story tank, and eye all of the fish first.Then, go back to the main entrance, turn around, and walk to the tanks at the right.By the time you get through the first walkway, and into the next one (while taking lots of photos), the grade school/high school kids are starting to arrive.Around 10:00 to 10:30 a.m., the group of kids are sitting around the 2 story tank. At that time, 3 divers drop into the tank, 2 cleaning the sides, and one talking to the kids.It is interesting looking at the divers coexisting in the same environment with the fish, and the kids looked like they were thinking the same thing. Take the time to watch and listen to this program from either the first or second floor.I have never seen a more enthusiastic, yet composed group of kids, like I have seen in California. From the 3 groups of school kids that arrived before noon, every one of them rates higher than the same kids from our home state. That also reflects on the teachers.Lots of fish to see on both floors, along with several areas where touching is allowed.In the time that I was there, taking movies were much better than trying to catch the elusive fish. I took some great vids, but I don’t think that TripAdvisor has the ability for that format or placement.We didn’t make it into the 3d or other theater, because of availability, but what we had seen in the 3 hours was wonderful.Keep In mind that you have outdoor areas on both the upper and main floors, with lots to see.In Allentown, PA, we have what they call a Trout Rearing Farm. I never understood using a term of child development in association with growing trout for sporting needs. In a way, it reduces man’s dominant attributes, and belittles the terms of our achievements, into an ordinary fish catching ritual.As for the Aquarium of the Pacific, we found it to be a land of wonder. For us, 9 a.m. was the perfect time to go, and our noon time lunch was just a block away.Hope that you have as much fun as we did.Jerryandbarb8",gerard a
50,Amazing Afternoon at the Aquarium!,"Great aquarium - the afternoon I spent there was my favourite part of my whole trip to Long Beach. The volunteers were extremely knowledgeable and helpful, which really enriched my experience, as they were so happy to talk about the animals, and share their love for them. Many different exhibits from various parts of the ocean, which was very interesting to see. Even got to see flash light fish which I have never seen before! And, of course the penguins brought a smile to everyone's face",AlbertaBound0

50,Beautiful. Educational. Friendly Helpful Staff.,"We visited the museum on a Tuesday in December and it was bustling with school groups. Its an incredible collection of sea life that one can not only look at but some exhibits include animals one can touch! They have cow head Rays, Bonnet head sharks and horseshoe crabs you can touch as well as sea stars and sea cucumbers, etc. The huge fish tank in the main gallery is fascinating and watching the sardines ""school"" is, in a word, shimmering. Parking is 8$ at the aquarium's own garage. There is a coupon that saves quite a bit of money off of your entrance fee in the 2014 Entertainment book.",OhSugarrush

10,Don't waste your time or money.,"My wife,Teacher, wanted to visit this place. We were disappointed. The facility was dirty with unruly children who apparently had no parents or guardians; and a few adults too. Food/drink prices ridiculous. Exhibits were average. Won't be back here!",foodcritic010
40,A really great place with great exhibits.,"They have added a number of attractions and species since our last visit a few years ago. If you have not been there for a while it is time to return. It just seems like there is a lot more to see here now, My wife is enamored with the jellyfish exhibit and they have one of the best displays.I would give this attraction an excellent rating, but the only ""manned"" stations are the petting areas and it is difficult to find anyone if you have a question. (Some of the displays are not documented well.) And, while I guess there is some environmental reason for dimming the lights in certain exhibits, they are really difficult to view when you are 75 years old. (Something the youngsters who work there would not appreciate.)We will definitely return, probably with our granddaughter.",Bob S
40,Great Aquarium,My daughters loved this aquarium when we lived in Long beach and we would frequently spend the afternoon there. The membership is a great value. It can be crowded in the summer time with camp programs and with tourists. The best days to attend are Monday-Friday in the day. there is a lot to do around the Aquarium as well so it is a great day trip. A variety of fish and sea creatures. Nice water play features outside as well,kadieliz
40,Really Nice Aquarium!,"We went to the aquarium on a whim one late afternoon. Walking into the building, you're completely unaware of the exhibits available to see. There are a few on the first floor, but you have to go to the backside of the aquarium and the upper floors to see the majority of them. You need to explore as the signage pointing you to the other areas is not readily visible, if it even exists. There's an outdoor area with touch pools and an animal hospital that I would have never known existed had we not explored every path. You miss the HILARIOUS sea lions if you don't make it outside!In short, explore! There are some really fantastic things to see here...you don't want to miss any of them!",Tgaitan

30,aquarium and kid zoo,"since i just moved across country i have been doing everything i can around the la area. the aquarium was recommended so we checked it out on a rainy sunday afternoon. parking is easily found in the deck next to the aquarium. there was no line for tickets, and it didn't seem crowded but it was really loud from screaming kids everywhere we went. definitely a place for families. the exhibits were educational, but we were more interested in just looking at pretty fish and tanks. the touch tanks were a lot of fun, you get to pet jelly fish, horse shoe crabs, sharks, rays, and skates. that was the best part of the trip, and almost made the $30 ticket worth it, almost. the exhibits are really pretty and well taken care of. there is even an outside bird area that is fun if you buy the bird nectar, otherwise they don't pay much attention to you. we saw the sea lion/seal and sea otter presentations and they were neat. there are places to eat inside and a gift shop with lots of knick knacks. the workers there are pretty nice, but the people visiting are pretty rude and will step on your feet, run into you, and let their kids run wild basically without a care. overall, not a bad trip, i'd recommend a weekday for a quieter and more painless trip for your ears and toes. make sure to get your parking validated so you only pay $8 instead of $15.",J S
40,Great Aquarium of Long Beach,You have to come visit this incredible aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach. Tucked down by the Rainbow Lagoon across from the Queen Mary.

50,Fun time at the aquarium!,"I enjoy going to museums, aquariums, and zoos but they can sometimes be exhausting because they're so big. Aquarium of the Pacific was just the right size! My wife and I visited on Thanksgiving Day and it was fairly busy but not overcrowded. There's lots to do and see, they have plenty of ""touch"" exhibits, and plenty to learn about. There's an outdoor portion, too, which is really awesome because we got to enjoy the aquarium while enjoying the beautiful SoCal weather, too. It was something we were both able to enjoy - it's not just for kids! Would absolutely go back.",Ana S

Spent a long afternoon here one day attending some of the staff presentations, looking at exhibits -- some interesting sea dragons -- soaking in knowledge about the oceans. There is a very nice cafeteria with excellent food and enough variety at the aquarium store to satisfy most people.I liked the fact the aquarium has very few parrot fish as these fish need to stay on the coral reefs for the safety of the reefs which made me think the aquarium valued sustainability more than their own remarks about valuing sustainability.",arazi1991

Of these major aquariums, I would rank it third which isn't bad. It's just competing against some of the top facilities in the US. So in the Los Angeles area, this is the one to go to. It's well laid out and they have very good exhibits. If you know that you're going, look around especially online. It's usually less expensive to buy tickets that way than at the aquarium.",am08540

Cool shows with some trained sea animals. Enjoyable for wide range of ages. Handicap prepped! Only reason I face, 4 stars is because of one of the restaurants. After watching all of the sea creatures, I developed an appetite for the catfish on the menu and it was the worst I'd ever had. My teen says the sandwiches/salads are better.and they did seem to be. Also some additional organizing of the presentation overall would be a smoother visit, but otherwise, I recommend this place, if for nothing else, just the experience of touching some of the animals there.

Their seminars and special events are worth the time and I always learn something. Purchasing a membership is cost effective and tax deductible.",562MarcyS
40,Aquarium of the pacific,Nice aquarium for families. Lost of programs and fun things for kids to do. Not travelling with kids. Go early!,kskkgd
50,always fun & educational,"We live a few miles away and love to go to the aquarium. We've been members since my son was 15 months old. He's 4 now and has a 2-year old sister. Both kids have their favorite fish that they like to visit. If you want to avoid the crowds (schools on weekday mornings and tourists on weekends) go on a weekday afternoon and you'll have the place to yourself. The gift shop always has something new, too, and pretty reasonably priced; members get a 10% discount. The restaurant is also good. You can't go wrong with an annual pass if you live within easy driving distance. Don't forget to buy discounted parking passes at the membership desk; you'll pay only $4 per visit.",DKmom2013
40,"Aquarium of the Pacific, Long Beach","Having visited a number of Aquariums around the world, they are all pretty much the same, except they do have 'localised"" displays but many are almost the same - tropic, arctic, etc. How differently can you display penguins and tropical reef fish - ""Nemo""?",IJtraveller
50,Excellent Exhibits,"Beautiful museum with a number of different exhibits, some hands on. Enjoyable for adults and children alike.",Doris F
40,"Fun, Educational and Worth a Visit","A great day outing for thw whole family. Very popular with families with young children and school field trips.Extensive collection, lots of activities for the kids. It a wonderful educational outing for the day. Its large enough to offer a wide variety of exhibits, but small enough to tackle in half a day. You can feed lorakeet by hand. The shark water play areas were great photo op.The aquarium is in walking distance to several restaurants across the street. Convenient parking as well.",Russ Lacuata
50,A great place to learn and see beautiful animals,I love the Aquarium of the Pacific. The aquariums are nicely displayed and the animals are gorgeous!,Jason B
40,"Impressive, Beautiful, Enjoyable, But Inadequate Organization","The is an impressive aquarium with excellent facilities and courteous and knowledgeable staff. Many of the exhibits are beautiful and creative. The hands-on stuff for kids and the art station for kids to draw and color were big hits with the children we brought. But, as others have commented, there is no clear pattern or path to follow, and anyone who wants to do more than ooh! and aah! at the pretty fish will wonder why so often the signs on various tanks don't include all the species, and why there was so little information about the fish and other creatures, like where they came from, their habits, etc. The educational aspects of this facility, which has many impressive scientific achievements to its credit, and does a wonderful job of maintaining its exhibits, were anemic at best. Too impressive to miss, but boy, could it be better!",Richard K
40,"fun, fun, fun",had fun with the family in the aquarium. you can interact with some of the shark and ray species. we enjoyed it so much. kind a small though.,Shayne79
50,Aquarium of the pacific,"loved all the hands on ... touching the sea ife.Loved the sea horses, and all the colorful sea life.",Marsha H
30,Pricey and crowded,"We had a lot of fun. However, as another reviewer pointed out, there was not clear path to follow, not enough educational programs going on, to point out the most important features, or to offer hands on experience for the kids. When somebody was explaining something, the audio quality was so poor that over the noise made by so many people it was almost impossible to see/hear. I would suggest they would call the shows overhead, we missed one of the little shows (there were not too many). On site, Jamba juice smoothie $4.75, starbucks latte $4.75. We paid over $50.00 for 2 adults admission - we had $3.00 off for adults, and kids free, but it still seem expensive for me. We had just 2.5 hours until the closing time, and we thought we are not going to have enough time, but we were pretty much done after 1.5 hours. I would also suggest trying it during the week, not in week-end. It was very crowded.",iloredana
40,a day to watch kids playing with the fish,school groups were well handled. There wasn't a clear path to follow to visit the various exhibits. The 5 minute show warning about global warming only had one viewpoint and struck me as an advertisement rather than a learning experience.,egbggill
50,Amazing!,"I loved it!! it was fantastic! A bit pricey (look for coupons in Long Beach - We saw $8 off coupons.... after we paid full price) - But after the experience and the amazing facility they have there, it was worth every penny.",Michelle M
40,A nice day,"This is a managable place to visit with kids. Not too big, but enough exhibits to keep them interested. The cafeteria is not realy fabulous - but it is fine for a quick nibble and soda. Altogether a nice day.",Heather2917
40,Nice Aquarium,This aquarium is nice in that it has lots of touching pools and things to do with children. The cafe is a little pricy but that is to be expected. It has the largest gift shop I've seen for a zoo or an Aquarium.,TheTravelingKitchen
40,Fun if you can find it.,"This was the hardest place to find. The signage is very bad. We kept driving around the block and missing the street it was on. We saw a big round blue building with whales and other fish on it and thought oh good we found it. We parked and walked two blocks to this building only to find out that this was an auditorium. I thought that it was the aquarium, how wrong was I, but there was no signage telling you what it was either. A nice couple came by and told us to follow them, three blocks away and down another street was the Aquarium. I think they should repaint that big blue building, it is very misleading. It cost $28.00 per adult and $18.00 for kids 3 and up. If you are smart you will get discount tickets. I had some for $10.00 off the original price. Most of the exhibits are up stairs on the second floor, divided into sections. One section you have Coral and small fish, another section you have sea horses, jellyfish, they also have a small pool that you and the kids can put your hands in and feel the coral, and plants, which is very educational.The next section is your larger fish and also has a pool for you to touch sting rays and small sharks. They feel like black olives. The exciting part is when you go outside and see the Otters, they are the cutest things ever, makes you want one of your own. The penguins have a really great exhibit with penguin statues you can take your picture next to. They are fun to watch. You can also put your hand in the baby shark tank and feel them. This Aquarium has a lot of great areas for educational purposes. I think that everyone should bring their children and grandchildren just so they can have the opportunity to feel these creatures. They have a small seal show which is entertaining and very educational as well. Even though I had a very hard time finding this attraction, I would definitely go back. Itu is very enjoyable for everyone of all ages, just make sure you keep in mind that the big blue building with whales, sharks etc. on the side of it is not the Aquarium and make sure you look for the discount tickets. Remember the Aquarium is three blocks to the right of the big blue building and down a street called Aquarium Way.",zenakitty1
50,best attraction in Long Beach,I am a charter member of the LB Aquarium plus I paid to have a plack with my name and my wifes name engraved near the shark tank I don't think that I could have spent the money more wisely as this aquaruim is one of the best in the USThe aquarium is open and airy unlike many others that are totally indoors and darkAmple parking is across the street,Capt_Tom
50,Nice aquarium.,We go several times a year with guests with children. They are pretty much in awe of the large aquariums with divers.,CAJoetraveler
50,Fun,"Enjoyed the aquarium, large and varied with inside and outside exhibits. A worth while two hours spent.",ladaz79
50,Breathtaking,The price of under $30 was reasonable. They also have a military discount.Wanted a larger selection of postcards in the gift shop. I use them in my scrapbooks because the photos are better. I post people pictures by the postcards.,Sarah F
40,Locals: Buy the Annual Pass,"This is a great half-day attraction. You can touch sharks, get up close to jellyfish, and have a bird land on you (If you are into that sort of thing. I am not.). This is a well-kept, modern aquarium that is definitely worth a visit. In fact, the annual passes are tax deductible, so well worth it if you are a local!",marciaink
50,The No.1 thing to visit in Long Beach,"I think you can get discounts if you book online but at the kiosk it was $28.95 for adults ($25.95 for Seniors ie over 62).We were there on a Sunday morning. Allow a minimum of 90 minutes - 2 hours if with children! Some very educational exhibits that very well thought out (my wife used to be a teacher of under 9's, and was impressed).Also do take a look at the Lorikeet forest, especially if you’re with children.Slight quibble : the initial wall displays on “ocean exploration” and “technological advances” were very US-centric. Apart from Eriksson, Columbus, Magellan, Cook and Darwin, no-one else ever discovered anything. So no mention of the Portuguese such as Bartolomeu Dias or Vasco de Gama, and how Brazil, Angola, Mozambique, Goa or Timor got colonised. Map didn’t even show that Cook had ever reached Hawaii (where he was killed). Likewise the technology : apart from the invention of Scuba & Aqualung, everything to do with ocean exploration after 1900 was American. They do include James Cameron descending the Mariana Trench in 2012 but they probably think he’s American (he’s actually Canadian).",kapple999
50,Wonderfull experience - MUST if you are near,"We spent several hours in the aquarium and had great times there. It's one of the best places to learn something about sea life and how we all can protect it! Little fishes and big fishes can be seen here ! Also sharks, sea lions, pinguins and even colorfull birds steal the show in this park ! A must visit if you are near !",CoffeeSeekingKing
40,Beautiful!,"Definetely was worth a trip from L.A.Very beautiful and organized. It was awesome to see all those amazing creatures!Tip: try to buy your tickets online, sometimes there is a discont.",CarolPrado
40,Amazing time!!,There are so many things to see at this aquarium! My kids loved feeding the lorikeets and petting the sharks. It's definitely worth the price to get in. The only drawback is that it gets really really crowded - so unbearably crowded that actually seeing inside many of the tanks is practically impossible. We got there early enough that we had just finished seeing everything as it was becoming crowded. I would recommend getting there early and leaving around lunchtime.,NotthatMelB
50,One of the best aquariums in the country,"I've been to many around the country, and this is one of the best. Many different exhibits, with lots of opportunities to touch various sea creatures. I particularly like the ray pool and the Northern Pacific touch tank. Food and drink are available on site, plus it is ideally located near restaurants in Long Beach. A great place to visit before you board a Carnival Cruise, which docks by the nearby Queen Mary.I would recommend getting there first thing on a Saturday, as it can get really busy in the afternoon. Another good time to visit is in the summer when they have evening hours. We are members so we visit frequently.",misterjohnny
50,Perfect for toddlers & grandparents!,"There is lots to see and touch, but it's not huge like seaworld so you don't have to spend the whole day walking...which made it a perfect trip for our 20 month old and her grandmother. It was stroller friendly, there were plenty of places to take a seat and the staff members were very engaging.There's a little tunnel at the penguin exhibit just the right size for toddlers to walk in and be incased in the penguin swimming area. There were some baby chicks that were showing off for the kids.There are hands on exhibits where you can touch jellyfish, horseshoe crabs, sharks, and rays.Sea otters playing is a site to see & a harbor seal kept coming up to the glass with what looked like a big smile giving kisses to our tot.",SereneEcho

40,Aquarium Great Fun! Pack Lunch!,"This is my second visit to the aquarium. First time taking my 4 yr old. He loved it. Plenty to see and do. My only issue would be the food. It cost like $50 bucks for a couple corn dogs...that weren't good. Still scratching my head trying to figure out why this cost me as much as a dinner at the Doubletree hotel( which included beer). Anyway, I recommend packing lunch!",RS1990

40,Pleasantly surprised at the multi-cultural entertainment,"I went here mainly because I had time to kill before a red-eye flight, a discount voucher, and it was close to the water. I wasn't really expecting to be too excited about it. What I loved turned out to be the Asian festival going on in the foyer. It was wonderful...the displays, the dancers, the energy of the visitors. I didn't see a lot of fish but that was my choice. They also had a nice gift shop.",hildegard2011
40,Good value - educational and fun,"This is a very educational and informative aquarium. Well laid out and amply staffed by people who will answer your questions. It is the only aquarium I have been in where you can actually touch the sharks and rays. There is a wide variety of fish on display and they are accompanied by excellent descriptions. The habitats are beautifully recreated. Some of the jellyfish displays are amazing. In addition to fish there is a penguin exhibit and a lorikeet gallery. The lorikeets are colorful Australian birds and you can go in and feed them. Have your camera ready as they will land on you. The aquarium is organized into galleries - make sure you visit each one. The guide book (free) has places where you can put embossed stamps from the galleries as you visit them (there are embossing machines throughout) and by the end of the visit you have a nice souvenir booklet. A very good and reasonably priced gift store is on site. There is a restaurant available that offers a limited but reasonable selection of items for lunch. If you are a tourist, do not confuse the aquarium with the arena that has whales painted on it - no fish in the arena!",trainfan2000
40,Great Place...a little pricey...but great deal,Over all it was a great experience! I did like it...by the way if you pay for the aquarium and the whale ride...at the same time...you save BIG time money...I would definitely go back again!,jasonk7777
50,Must see if visiting LA.,The aquarium was outstanding. Need at least 3-4 hours. If spending the day you can see the Queen Mary anchored near by with a combo ticket.,Ralph G
50,Fun and informative,We loved visiting the Aquarium and thought it was well worth the price of admission ($24 prepaid online) plus the $8 parking. The tanks had a great variety of fish with signs to tell you the names. The aquarium is divided into regional sections. We saw everything in about 2 1/2 hours and it wasn't crowded on a Monday afternoon. Prices in the gift shop are reasonable as well.,TAtruth

30,a little over priced!,usually I give 4-5 stars to most places but this aquarium was a little over priced and I expected a better collection. I think the jelly fish and seals were the most amazing part. It was really crowded the day I went so you had to wait in line to see the fish. They also have a bundle for aquarium ticket and LA zoo ticket which is worth it.make sure you buy your ticket online beforehand to avoid wasting your time in entrance line.,Raihaneh A
50,Educational,"We live in Atlanta, home to the largest aquarium in the world. We were skeptical going to this venue. Would we see anything new and different? My husband and I were pleasantly surprised at the difference! Much information on the Pacific Ocean and its sea life. I especially liked the video on the environmental impact we are having on the oceans of the world.",gapeach1027
50,Delightful way to spend an afternoon,"Though I never did find the Humuhumunukunukuapua`a (that's Hawaii's official state fish) I thoroughly enjoyed my visit. I loved watching the otters the most. They look cuddly and cute but from what I learned from the VIP tour of the facilities, they are among the most territorial mammals around. Easily accessible for all includingsmall children in strollers and fpeople in wheelchairs, this aquarium is comfortable, clean, and entertaining.",MBiblis
50,Fun for the family,"This is a great place to visit, especially with the family. Have fun and learn a lot. Part indoor/part outdoor. There's a tropical bird dome, where the birds fly around in the open and there's an out door water area where you can touch rays and some fish.",Fernando J

30,Great Lorikeet exhibit,"The lorikeet exhibit was excellent, the touch pools were very cool, and the sea lion and harbor seal training session was very informative. The entire venue is only 2 floors- very small compared to other aquariums I've visited.",gwen450
50,Love this Aquarium!,"As a resident of Long Beach within walking distance and a SCUBA diver, I absolutely love the Aquarium of the Pacific. It's fun to see and point out to others, not only the local fish I see diving, but also tropical fish I've either seen or want to see diving. Watching the big sharks being fed is still fun for me and I also like to give the friendly rays a pet as they seem to enjoy their interactions with patrons. I've always loved the ocean and when I can't be underwater, the AOP is the next best thing. I would recommend going on weekdays and certainly not on holidays if you can avoid it as it can get quite packed with people and strollers, but this is a great place for friends, family and certainly kids. It's also worth mentionting that AOP has a ""Divers Day"" where SCUBA divers get in free along with other promotional events around the year.",Katie F
50,No tricks! But it's a treat!,"I have been to this Aquarium many times and at one point I was a supporting member. This is a traditional Aquarium in every sense of the word and not an ocean theme park where animals are forced to do trained behaviors for a fish. This campus is truly lovely and the exhibits are truly amazing. Long Beach did it right and there is no arguing with that. This is a great day of fun for Adults or Children! The lines can get a little long on the weekends especially in the early to mid afternoon. My advice is to arrive early before it gets too crazy busy and you will be fine! Parking is right next door in the parking structor and again, to get the best parking you will want to come earlier in the day! If you love Seals, Sea Lions, Sharks, Birds, and all sorts of Amazing Fish from the Pacific Ocean and around the world you will be fascinated and in awe of the wonderful creatures who call the aquarium home! My favorites are The Weedy and Leafy Sea Dragons! You won't want to miss them. See the website for hours as well as parking and admission fees! You will love the Aquarium of The Pacific!",rodvilencia
40,"Love the aquarium, hate the queues",I go to this aquarium every time I visit LA. The tanks and attractions are amazing and I highly recommend the behind the scenes tour. Be warned not to go on a busy day as it can get so crowded and you end up waiting for ever to get to see into the tanks.,EFowler7563
50,Worth every penny,The family spent the entire day here. Watching the kids touch a sting ray and a shark was worth the price of admittance in and of itself. There is so much to look at and enjoy it really is a full day experience.,sasnks
50,Touch a Stingray,"The exhibits are great. Childlren can touch stingrays, anemone, starfish (with hand sanitizer near the stations). The jellyfish exhibits were amazing and they had special lighting so you can see the lights undulating within the jelly fish. Sharks, of course, and they swim right up to the glass. The web site will give you further information but I thought it was well worth admission.",60Diana

I would call it a medium sized aquarium; great for kids.We had an enjoyable time looking at all of the tanks, and then ate next door at Bubba Gump Shrimp Co (yum).You can buy tickets online if you don't want to wait to get them at the aquarium. We bought tickets online as a combination with the USS Iowa battleship, which is about 10 mins away from the aquarium. Were able to pick up the tickets outside at the automated kiosk - was simple and didn't have to wait in line.Convenient parking is right across the street in the form of a parking deck.

30,Interesting but not memorable,"My wife and I visited this aquarium because it's fairly close to where we live. Since I am primarily interested in photography, my primary reason for going was getting some great photos. I did get some decent photos, but this place doesn't come near the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and has similar admission prices. The highlights were a nice variety displays, but the layout is pretty confusing with food and gift shops being much more visible that the displays. Overall it was an okay day, but I probably won't go again. On the other side of the coin, I can't wait to visit Monterey again.",Michael E
40,"Nice aquarium, close parking","Love this aquarium. Park in the structure n walk a very short distance to get inside. Buy tickets online to save a little.The aquarium has a lot of inside exhibits as well as a lot of stuff outdoors. There are several opportunities to actually touch the sealift: rays, jelly fish, sharks, to name a few. There is a tank where you can watch divers go in and feed the inhabitants, but there was technical difficulty and the divers and the man outside were unable to communicate with each other.Was a nice visit however. Lot of people as it was a Saturday and we got there late morning. Probably arrive early in the day to avoid crowds.",wannaseetheworldlt

40,"Fun time, just not the best","I guess I had my hopes a little higher for this aquarium as it is right on the ocean. I was expecting some big stuff. However, it was still very enjoyable. The best parts were all of their touch and feel tanks. How often do you get to pet a jellyfish? It was amazing.",MissRAD
50,Fun day at the aquarium + whale watching tour,"I bought the aquarium + whale watching tour combo, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The aquarium has several different galleries of exhibits that are all very interesting. My personal favorites were the deep sea exhibits (had a jellyfish touch tank!), the kelp forest, and the seal and sea lion exhibit. I spent about 2 hours touring the aquarium. They offered 2 whale watching tours per day, on at noon, the other at 3:30. I went on the later one. The advantage of that is that if they see whales on the early cruise, they can return to the same area on the second cruise, and save time looking. On our cruise, we saw 3 blue whales, a pod of common dolphins, a pod of bottlenose dolphins, and sea lions. There was plenty of viewing area on the boat, and everyone (including children) were able to get good views. The cruise is staffed by biologists from the aquarium, who give a lot of information throughout the cruise on whale, dolphins, and marine ecology. They were very knowledgeable and were happy to answer questions from the group. I highly recommend taking a day to do the aquarium and whale watching cruise.",Utley
50,Great way to spend an afternoon.,"What was supposed to be a means of filling in the time before our trip home, turned out to be a wonderful way to spend the afternoon. Although the layout is a bit convoluted the exhibits were very informative and easily viewed. From hands-on exhibits, to live shows, to a vast array of specimens, there is something for everybody. The aquarium appears to be a favorite of families and camps, so be prepared to encounter a multitude of children - less so as the day goes on.Parking is conveniently located across the street and, with validation, is reasonably priced. Having dined at similar attractions in the past I was a bit skeptical on what I may find. Although not a bargain, the food and selection is very good.To save some money on admission, I recommend purchasing tickets prior to arrival. I did so on my smart phone while in the parking garage and found the process easy to do.",Robert D
50,great aquarium in a good location,This aquarium has an amazing number of exhibits in a good sized area. The fact that it is right on the beach is a plus also. You can make a day of it.,Eli E
50,Fascinating experience,Beautiful displays of fish and so much to see and explore. Worthwhile for adults and of course for kids,Amey L
50,Nice outting,"We went on a weekday to not have to wait in long lines and to have more space. Price was ok. Many rooms for seen different types of sea animals. Loved petting the sharks, manta rays and other. Bird sanctuary was nice.",Yeddie_go
50,A wonderful experience for all,"This is a wonderful place to visit, with or without children. I took my 3 1/2 year old grandson with me and we both enjoyed it. His favorite thing to do was pet the sharks and rays. There are many hands-on exhibits, as well as shows. Be sure to make plans to stop by the Aquarium of the Pacific and make a day of it. There is quite a bit to see and you won't want to miss any of it. The exhibits are wonderful and the staff is very helpful. Don't forget to check out the feeding schedule in the main building. You never know what you might see. If you live close enough to visit a few times a year, look into a membership. It's well worth the price and then you don't have to try to cram everything into one day! I've been several times and STILL haven't seen it all.",Patti T
50,Fantastic place to visit for the entire family,We recently went to California to visit my daughter and this was a suggestion from her co-workers. At first arrival the location is so breathtaking it sets the right tone for the rest of the day. As soon as we arrived we bought our tickets for the cruise around the harbor as well which was just terrific to say the least. All the exhibits were fantastic as well as the hands on activities. I couldn't believe my son was willing to touch the sting ray it was fantastic. The shark feeding was phenomenal wow I thought I would be grossed out but I was instead in just complete awe of it what amazing creatures. One of my favorite parts was going around to the stamp stations we made sure to complete the stamps in our book what a great memory to have forever. Would definitely recommend any family or couple to visit. Oh yeah the sea lions sleeping on the buoys awesome!,Cambymom
40,"Fun to Watch the Fishes, World Class Aquarium","We like to visit the aquarium of the Pacific and have visited a couple of times. It is a world class level aquarium with good exhibits. The focus of the museum is on Southern California and Baja area, Northern Pacific, and the Tropical Pacific. There are a number of very good main galleries as well as outdoor fish areas.We like the sea otter habitat.Also, the movie is good to see.Given the quality of the aquarium, the cost of admission is high to support the aquarium. One time we were able to find a goldstar discount which helped a lot in price. As such, one might want to check for discounts when considering going to this world class aquarium.We went once on the week-end and once mid week and the fewer people really helped us see the fishes better.We have gone to numerous aquariums and I like this one as the 2nd best in California. The one that I like just a little bit (and I mean just a little bit better) is the aquarium in Monterey.'",mini
50,Our Favorite,"Okay, we haven't been to a ton of aquariums, but still, we love the Long Beach aquarium enough to have visit it the last four times we've been in California. And we are NOT a drive away. We like that there is so much to see. My son and I enjoyed the semi-private shark tour. Other times, we've just enjoyed the self-guided tour. This last time, we fed nectar to birds in the bird atrium. Our kids and our friends loved it. My kids also never get tired of petting the baby sharks and rays, and watching the otters play.",luv2plan44
50,A wonderful Aquarium,"This Aquarium is very well laid out. Different sections for different types of sea creatures. There is a large outdoor area where there are several fish and rays which you can pat as they swim past. Delightful sea birds also such as penguins, and puffins. Lots of staff on hand. Great place for families to visit.",Noelene B
50,Very cool aquariums!,"I like aquarium tanks that are like walls, so this place is cool. Food is fine. Not personally a fan of shows, so I skip those kinds of things. Beautiful, exotic sea life in big, settings... they all seem happy and active.",Joey C
50,Fantastic aquarium,"This was our first visit, and based on our experience, we converted our daily tickets to Members/Grandparents Plan tickets. With 2yr old grandkids, we'll definitely be back. Lots of every well designed and maintained exhibits. Very engaging staff. Easy highway access, and ample parking. We started our visit mid-morning on a Saturday, with minimal crowds; by the time we left, after lunch, the crowd was more substantial, and there was a line of cars waiting for parking. Solution: arrive early!",JimW_VI
50,Wonderful,"What a great place, my grand daughter loved the seals. Well worth visiting. Plenty for all ages to see and enjoy, from 2 to 62, well that the age range of my party.",iwells6
50,fascinating waterlife,"Lots of interesting and beautiful sealife. Did not need the whole day to enjoy the living displays, therefore took advantage of discount evening admission.",FussySusie
50,Sea Animals,"Visited here with grandchildren. Bought tickets online. Lots to see petting area was interesting for all, including me. You can be hand stamped to go out and come back. Lots of food service outside. Very good explanation on various areas. Good place for kids, some adults may be boared. Ample parking available .",Perkadventures
50,Amazing place for kids,"This was a great visit. The exhibits were well planned and maintained and the staff and volunteers were fabulous. A bit crowded, but well worth the effort.",Seracha
30,"Good for Younger Children, not so for Teens","We visited the aquarium with a combo ticket from the Queen Mary. It's clear that the staff who work here put a lot into the aquarium, and for children under 12 it's probably a great attraction. Our teens found the aquarium a little uninspiring, albeit that's perhaps as much about their age as the aquarium, together with the fact that it was extremely busy with both school trips and senior citizens organised trips when we visited. A couple of hours is probably as long as you could spend in the aquarium, less with teenagers.",vsu419
40,Smaller than expected,"Bought discount tickets online so could only enter aquarium after 3pm. No problem as this is not a very big aquarium and I doubt anyone would need more than two hours here. Exhibits are great, good learning stations for kids and adults. Fun watching the animals. Don't know if they have any animal shows, if they do there weren't any after 3pm or we just didn't know about it. Didn't eat/drink there so can't comment on price of food/drinks. The Lorikeet exhibit was fun for the kids. Fun place to spend a couple of hours.",SpokieTexas
40,My Teenagers Loved It!!,"We visited the Aquarium of the Pacific with a 16,15 and 13 year old not sure if they would like it or not but they ALL enjoyed!! They had many exhibits in which you were able to touch different sea creatures which everyone liked. The aquarium was busy but didn't feel overcrowded. The exhibits were all easy to see and move through. The one draw back I would say was the food - very expensive!! Not sure of what you are allowed to take inside since my kids are past the age of needing to carry a bag of stuff everywhere we go but if you can take snacks I would suggest it. We had lunch while there and it was probably our most expensive meal of the trip, especially considering what we actually ate. Otherwise a very enjoyable visit to the Aquarium of the Pacific.",ana_chia11
50,Great Aquarium,"Aquarium of the Pacific(AOP) is a great aquarium. Very do-able in a day. The AOP sticks to the Pacific Ocean and does not try to cover and showcase all Oceans of the world, and this is a good thing as Long Beach, California sits right on the Pacific Ocean. The AOP does an excellent job. Very hands on for the younger crowd, but keeps the interest and awe for all ages to experience Ocean life.",JAR411
40,Fun family outing,"I've had a membership to this Aquarium on and off for 13 years. It's an amazing place to take the family. I'd highly recommend going early in the morning close to opening before it gets too crowded. It's got great indoor and outdoor exhibits. There are lots of hands on stations for the kids and/or adults where one can touch anemones, rays, starfish, etc. I'd say 2 hours is good if you've never been. It's great for all ages.",Califoodlover
50,Great for all the family,"A great interactive aquarium. Being able to get close and touch jelly fish, baby sharks, crabs and rays was a big hit with all the family. Take the 'behind the scenes' tour, its definately worth the extra cost. John (our guide) was very knowledgeable, interesting and really bought the whole aquarium to life. Get there early (opens at 9am), no crowds, and lots of attention from helpful freindly staff and volunteers.",Dawn F
10,Excellent Aquarium With Good Depiction of Local Creatures,"More children friendly than most aquariums and inclusive of birds and other creatures associated with local waters. Clearly loved by local folk with many volunteers. Because our niece is a member, we were able to avoid lines. However, it is best to be there when it opens as parking was full by 1 PM. Also, if one wants to feed nectar to the Rainbow Lorikeets, one should be in line when that exhibit opens. Touch tanks also popular. A new display depicted Rainbow Trout.",2Starbirders
50,Very cool,This place is really cool. love the tunnel of glass so you can watch the fish and sharks swim around. It has been a few years sense i was there last but man i had a great time and i know the kids did to. Recommend a visit.,Joseph B
50,Fantastic,Beautiful exhibits create groupings of various creatures in natural settings. Travel the world's oceans and their inhabitants.,Kathy984
50,Great visit and great value,It was our first trip to the aquarium in long beach. We purchased tickets online and printed them from home. By doing this we did not have to wait in a long line to buy tickets. We were able to walk right in and not have to wait. The aquarium was a busy place but not overcrowded. Exhibits were great. Kids can touch animals in several different areas. We had a great time. We purchased the aquarium tickets with the 45 min harbor cruise and the 4D movie. The adult ticket was $40 and child was $20. Good value for 3 attractions. I think the harbor cruise was lackluster but no big deal. We had a great time. We did lunch across the street at Bubba gumps....parking was reasonable for $8 in the parking garage. I would definitely recommend.,rprasad80
50,Refreshing Exciting Day,"When you walk into the front entrance you are greeted by a huge whale floating in the center of the room. Perfect for the little ones, not to much walking, its all in one place. The kids were very excited to see and touch almost everything. Very soothing watching every living thing in ahhhh! My niece and nephew were memorized at all that nature and marine life. They were so enchanted by the seals, otters, penguins, and a huge variety of fish.",PasadenaDiamonds
40,Nice afternoon,"I was visiting my daughter in the SoCal area and we decided to do a few touristy things that weren't the routine type (Knotts, Disneyland, etc.) After touring the Queen Mary, we drove just a few minutes to the Aquarium of the Pacific. Although it is fairly small by comparison to others like Baltimore and Chicago, it is very nicely laid out and has great exhibits, both inside and out. Our favorite moment was probably feeding the lorikeets their nectar. (See picture) Would recommend to anyone, especially those who truly enjoy aquariums and those with kids.",Cheri S
40,Good,Touching the fish was goodI liked the shows thereOutside the aquaruim there were very nice counsir i enjoed itDjdjdjdjdjsudjdidjdjdijd,Osama O
50,Great Place for Everyone!,"Wondeful place for the whole family. It rivals the aquarium in Monterey, CA. Took an 18 month old, a 7 year old and a 9 year old. They all loved it. What I liked the best was interior exhibits were low enough for hte baby to see.Get there early to avoid the school groups in the summer.",Joan M
50,Very cool place to take a girl on a date,We got there about 225 went over to bubba gumps p.s there are lots of great food choices to choose from before you go in to look at the exhibits. I got a pass for 2 tickets online at goldstar for 37 dollars and we got to see the exhibit from 3 to 6 O clock which was enough time to see everything I actually went an had another look at the exhibits I enjoyed most. This place was very very interesting and funn i would recommend this place to everyone!!!!!!,Derrick S
30,Interesting,Well worth a visit. Benefits are the connections to CA marine life. It stands in the shadow of Oceanario de Lisboa in Portugal.,OdeshogTravelers
40,Great for kids,This is the second time we went here in the past year and both our kids loved itOur son could not get enough of the seals and sea lions and our daughter (both age three) loved collecting the embosser stamps around the place for her mapSo much to see and do!,Eddy L
50,Good Time,"This was a great time for our nine year old grandson. He is always inquisitive about pretty much everything. He had a very good experience and enjoyed looking at all the different exhibits. We learned a lot of things about the different aquatic creatures. The touch tanks were fun, and although he learned a bit about sharks, he still doesn't trust that they don't want to eat him. The docents were all very knowledgeable and helpful. I think that the exhibits were very well done and well worth the visit.",Gail D
40,Fun day for the kids,"Went to the aquarium with a couple other families. Overall we had a good time. The exhibits were nice. There were a few areas that were interactive and allowed the kids the touch some of the sea creatures.All of the kids loved playing in the outdoor water play area. We spent a good portion of our visit there. Good thing they had food vendor that sold beer, lol. Their jalapeño and cheese pretzels were crazy delicious.The kids liked the puppet show, but for me it was the most boring part of my day.Make sure you validate your parking ticket for an all day discount. They have plenty of restaurants within walking distance of the aquarium, and we ended up at CPK.",tygerstile
40,An Enjoyable Couple of Hours,We participated in an evening business reception with full run of the aquarium. It was a very nice time. The displays and exhibits were very nicely done. My wife took dozens of photos. I turned the camera on her when she touched the stingray... We enjoyed our time at the aquarium.,Scotty M
40,Made my son's day,My teenage son wanted to hit an aquarium on our California trip so we stopped here and toured. There were quite a few children's groups there so we toured opposite of them. With the exception of the very large marine animals (orcas etc) this place was very informative and had a huge variety of thing to view. I would definitely recommend this to parents looking for something educational to attend with their kids.,Carol B
40,Super Fun for Sea Creature Enthusiasts,"Well worth every penny! Whale watching tour was excellent. Whale loving sons were able to see grey whales in the middle of the ocean (take sweaters,snacks, drinks, and sunscreen if taking kids). Beer/sodas available for purchase. Museum was amazing. We got to touch stingrays, sharks, jellyfish, and other oceanic creatures. Several displays and a ton of interesting info for adults. Highlight of the trip! Take hand sanitizer and snacks to keep kids clean and fed.",Road_Family915
30,Nothing impressive,"Our last visit to this aquarium was 11 years ago. Very little has changed. It is a ""one and done"" spot for us now. Our 8 year old enjoyed touching the small sharks, and the moon jellyfish. The staff was extremely engaging and helpful. It's an okay place, we spent close to 2 hours here, mostly trying to pet the small sharks deep in the petting tank. The aquarium will validate your parking, so it is $8.00 rather than $15. to park. We purchased a bundle ticket along with the USS Iowa to save money. This can be purchased right at the ticket booth or online.",AmieMo
40,Aquarium,"California tidelands laws require that ports earn and spend their revenues only on activities related to commerce, navigation, marine recreation and fisheries. Long Beach and LA ports generate significant funds, which have to be spent in the Tidelands. So how does the City spend this money -- build and maintain an aquarium and buy the Queen Mary. The ship is an economic disaster as was the first few years at the aquarium; however, great management of the aquarium has created an exciting attraction. We have been members for years and go back often.There are many volunteers explaining items to kids and a never ending list of new features and shows such as cultural dances from different countries, movies, and music. There is a special event every 15 minutes, often dedicated to children. The issue is when do you attend as a crowded facility is not entertaining. During the school year, 6-10 busloads of children are there every school day from 10 am -2:30 pm. On summer weekends, it is even more crowded. There are online discounts if you visit after 3 pm. Be selective on timing, but enjoy it.",edvonlef
30,Glad we didn't pay full price!,"Roomy and modern, we were disappointed that almost all of the aquariums' displays used plastic plants and corals etc. The most fun was playing with the seals in the underwater display late in the day. Make sure to look online for coupons to save yourself some money.",Bigarym
50,Great attraction for sea loving kids!,What a surprise this was. It's a sensational day trip for kids and adults who love sea life. The shark lagoon was best part. Warning-No whales or dolphins ( go to sea world in San Diego for those).,Stacey F
30,Nice aquarium - young kids will enjoy,"I compare all aquariums to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Nothing is as nice, so won't get a 5 star from me. This aquarium is nice....some interesting sea life I hadn't seen before. The don't really have any jaw-dropping exhibits....but it was nicely done and little kids will enjoy it.",DL9022
50,Great time including whale watching tour,"The aquarium was so much fun, just my hubby and me but we can't wait until the grandkiddos are big enough to take! I thought it was a great deal for the money... we did a combo ticket that included the whale watching tour. Although VERY chilly on the tour boat, it was great fun and we did see whales and dolphins. So much fun and the captain and crew were a great source of information.",Fern S
50,Wow!,So many sea creatures to observe and touch. Kids loved it! We loved it! Nature is amazing. We got to touch jellyfish and sea stars and look at creatures we never even knew existed. A great time!Pretty crowded. Be patient and make sure you have a snack before you go in!,SASTMMT89
50,A great afternoon!,"The Aquarium of the Pacific provides a great half - 3/4 day activity while in the Long Beach area. The exhibits vary and can be done either at a quick pace or taking additional time to read up on each animal. There are several ""hands on"" stations for kids with lines that move quicker than they look. I felt that all of the animals were easy to view, which can be difficult at an Aquarium. Certain animals (Sea Lions, Sharks) offered views at different levels, which was also great.The Aquarium staff, in particular the teenage volunteers, were great and added to the experience. This is definitely worth a stop, especially for those with kids in the 4-12 age range.",ElGuru71
50,Great aquarium!,"I went on my own to the evening hours (5-8:30) on a Monday. It was delightful! I was glad I did a bit of research on the exhibits before I went or I wouldn't have known that the Lorikeet forest closes at 5:30. I went there first, bought a cup of nectar and let the fun begin! The birds were great fun (just watch out- they poop a lot!) and I ran in to an off-duty employee who was taking some friends around and she gave me a little extra food to put in my cup. I spent most of my time there with a bird named Midge- so fun! The rest of the aquarium was charming as well! They struck a great balance between education and fun. There were a bunch of touch tanks and the rays encouraged you to pet them by coming to the side of the tank, just out of the water and splashing. Apparently, they're very social creatures and love to be stroked!! The staff was just lovely and I had several conversations with them. I would HIGHLY recommend this aquarium and, if you're like me and went alone, go to the evening hours. The admission is discounted and it wasn't crowded at all.",jennk12312
50,Unique fish and exhibits,"We loved the array of fish at this aquarium. We saw sea horses, octopus, sea dragons and others we had never seen at other US aquariums. Part of the aquarium is outdoors. It is a great family outing! We went with friends and the age range of children was 5-15 and all of them enjoyed our visit. We watched the last otter feeding if the day. It was a great learning experience and the marine biologists were very informative. Who knew otters were so smart!",LG2Pro
30,If you have a couple of hours to spare..,"Decent little aquarium. Parking is in the parking garage. Which is used for the whole area. If you go to the aquarium they will validate, $8.We just did the general admission with the 2 4D movies. Do not get the ""4D"" films. Monsters of the deep, and Turtle vision. ABSOLUTELY not 4d. I don't think the kids would enjoy it. Aquarium is a little on the small side. But its ok. There is a Lorikeet cage, where you can feed the birds. A couple of shallow water pools where you can touch some sharks, rays, jellyfish and horseshoe crabs.",Rob M
40,nice visit,"The kids loved the penguins, sharks, and sting rays.. too afraid to touch them, but was a fun visit.",kawaikatie
50,A great place to go,"I can't believe I waited so long to go here.i thought it would be small and boring,but it wasn't.it was big,there is a lot to do there.and we had a lot of fun. My grandson loved looking at all of the sea life.and watching the seal show. A must do trip if you are in long beach .look online to find discounts on your tickets. They have a little water area so bring a change of clothing if you want to let your child play in it.",DiannaS514
50,"Cheap, easy, fun","Our two year old adores it. Prices are fair, it isn't far, great all around. Perfect for toddlers.!",Amy O
50,Fun day,Was a great day lots to see. Loved the extra things that have been added since I was there when it first opened. Loved the hands on features.,Vicki D
30,Dr,We'll built however could b bigger exhibits. Price is reasonable parking right Across the road. Have persons explains various sea finds.,1DR
40,Fantastic staff and great exhibits,"This aquarium is a real jewel in Long Beach and a great way to spend a morning or afternoon. Our grandchildren were very entertained by the numerous interactive exhibits (touching various sea creatures such as sharks, rays, etc.) and we all learned a lot from the very informative and friendly staff. The aquarium has a cadre of extremely dedicated and passionate volunteers who care deeply about informing the public about the environmental impact we all have on the various residents of the deep blue sea. We highly recommend a visit to this attraction!!",Kwazycanucks
40,Great Place to Visit,Had some time to fill in on a recent business trip to Long Beach so decided to go the the Aquarium and was not disappointed.The day I went was not very busy so did not need to line up for entry nor for any of the exhibits and displays.The facility is well laid out and all displays were presented well with plenty of detailed explanatory notes.Overall a good and very enjoyable facility.,23PeterJ
40,Good Morning Visit,"I echo some of the other reviewers.We had a good time, but I have seen larger aquariums. There are some really neat things there and I am glad we went, but it is not anything that will stay with me. A lot of it is outside and it was a nice day. My 12 year old had a good time and my mom who is 85 also enjoyed her self. We stayed about 2.5 hours and could have stayed longer, but if you just went through it you could do it all in an 1.5 hours. I would suggest to get there right when it opened, it starts to get busy about 11 am. We went on Saturday.It seemed like it was hard to find stuff, like it was pieced together over time. It is not that big, but we kept getting lost/turned around.One thing I would recommend is skip the snacks. They seemed to be overpriced for what you got.",Debbie S
40,small aquarium with nice exhibits,"I bought our tickets online which made it convenient for entering the facility. Parking is just across the street, and we also added a harbor cruise with the dock 50 feet away. They have an interesting collection, especially the variety of seahorses, jellyfish, eels, rays and sharks. On the negative side, there were a great many small children when we visited on a weekday morning which is probably no problem if you're bringing your own but not so swell if you are not. In addition, if you have never been to an aquarium before it's probably a bigger thrill than if you have. I suggest keeping this in mind when planning a visit.",CalifCar
30,Decent Place to spend some time,"Lines were long just to enter this place, prices were a little steep for what was inside. Bottom line, I've been to better aquarium's but if you have a family with small kids, it's a decent place to kill a few hours..",DisneyBeachLasVegas
50,Great Experience!,"We recently visited this wonderful aquarium and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves! The staff is wonderful - many of them volunteers. It is very fun and educational - so many hands-on displays and fun activities. We only had 2 hours to spend, but could have easily stayed longer. I would highly recommend it for people of all ages! Be sure to stop at the Gift Shop - one of the most affordable I've ever visited!",Mimi F
50,Loved It!,"The Aquarium of the Pacific is a wonderful place to visit. The exhibits are beautiful, and most informative. There is lots to see and learn; our group included toddlers to grandparents, and all were enthralled. Feeding the parrots was an exceptional experience. We went early before it got too crowded. We had lunch there which was fairly expensive as we expected, but the food was generously sized and pretty good. All in all a great day!",Sundancekid330
50,Dive Immersion at the Aquarium,"Being avid dive travelers, we decided to go tropical a couple hours from our home in SoCal... WOW! This is a really great opportunity to experience diving with a plethora of tropical fish, work on your fish ID skills and there is a great display of humans on the other side of the glass!When you arrive, you have full (and expedited access) to the Aquarium, so plan on a couple hours before the meeting time. Then you meet your dive-master/buddy (David, in our case) who takes you on a tour and walks you through your dive plan in tennis shoes.Then you get a behind (and above) the tank tour where you get to see the infrastructure that keeps this amazing place thriving, and get to talk with the fish experts and learn stuff in a casual way, like the baby sea-horses (1/4' long) being fed the exact amount of food that would suffice without dirtying-up the tank until the keeper returned the next morning since sea-horses have no stomach, so food becomes waste in no time! Don't get me started on the Leafy Sea Dragons!The actual diving was awesome. There is a team of volunteer divers that maintain the tanks and make you feel very welcome. The gear is all provided (contain contamination) and is top-notch, safety is well covered and there is even a ""dry-eye"" divemaster on the outside of the tank to ensure another level of safety. The fish are very approachable, beautiful and have personalities of their own. From the walk-around, I thought the tank seemed small and we may get bored, but once you are in, it is awesome. The 50 minute dive flew by! So much healthy sealife around you all the time. Any dive site in the tropics may have the same but it will take you multiple dives to see it all. I'm still ID-ing fish from the pictures (they give you a camera to use and you keep the SD card) so I'll be more prepared for our trip in September!Aquariums of this size and expertise are outstanding in educating people about our limited and valuable resources. Being a temporary part of the micro-system display lets you realize the true dynamics and dedication involved in providing a realistic snapshot into a world many may never see, and you get to see it from the inside.",beachfeetSoCal
40,One of my favorites,"I've been to this aquarium four times over the past few years and still love it. It's a little small, but the interactive exhibits are the best. I could spend hours and the stingray touch pool. It's so fun just petting them as they swim by. Feeding the Lorakeets is fun too. It's gets crowded with school groups and tourists during the summer, but if you can put up with the crowds, it's worth it.",EuropeCosmicTravel
30,Nice attraction but can get very crowded,The AOTP does have some very nice exhibits but it's extremely crowded on weekends. Go during the week if you can to have a better experience.,latravelgirl
40,Nice but....,If you have been to one aquarium you have been to the mall. LOL I dop the wife and kids off at the aquarium and then walk over to Outback Steak House (right next door) and have a steak and a few beers.,JFern3
40,"""Informative""","The Aquarium of the Pacific (formerly the Long Beach Aquarium of the Pacific) first opened to the public on June 20, 1998. The aquarium sits on a 5-acre site on Rainbow Harbor in Long Beach, California.It is situated across the water from the Long Beach Convention Center, Shoreline Village, and the Queen Mary Hotel and Attraction.The Aquarium sees 1.5 million visitors a year and has a total staff of over 900 people including more than 300 employees and about 650 volunteers.The land where the Aquarium of the Pacific now sits did not exist back in the early 50s. The Aquarium is actually located in an area that was offshore of the old “Pike amusement park.”From the 1900s to the 1970s, the Long Beach Pike was considered to be the West Coast’s Coney Island. By the time the Pike closed down in the early 70s the area was run down.The Aquarium of the Pacific was built to help revitalize the Long Beach area, especially after the closure of the Naval Station and Shipyard in the 1990s.Today, with the Aquarium as its anchor, the area is a vibrant and attractive tourist destination for visitors of all ages.The Aquarium of the Pacific is one of the largest Aquariums & Zoos in the United States with more than 12,000 ocean animals and nearly 50 exhibits requiring more than a million gallons of Pacific seawater.It is the only aquarium in the world to focus on the Pacific Ocean. Visitors can enjoy more than 500 species, in 19 major habitats and 30 exhibits which take them on a journey throughout the Pacific Ocean's three regions: Southern California/Baja, the Tropical Pacific and Northern Pacific.Ranked as one of the top Family Vacation attractions in Los Angeles and Orange County, Aquarium of the Pacific is the perfect place to take children for educational entertainment.The Aquarium features a collection of over 11,000 animals representing over 500 different species in exhibits ranging in size and capacity from about 5,000 to 350,000 gallons.Our visit:In addition to visiting this attraction, we also toured the Queen Mary Museum which is anchored in Long Beach Harbor and close to the Aquarium of the Pacific.Anytime we visit the many aquariums from Hawaii to the numerous ones here on the “mainland” we are always excited to see the exhibits and its inhabitants.We enriched our children’s curiosity and knowledge base with exhibits to the inhabitants of the Pacific Ocean which comprises of three major permanent galleries, sunny Southern California and Baja, the frigid waters of the Northern Pacific and the colorful reefs of the Tropical Pacific.Our kids were mesmerized at the 142,000 gallon, three-story Blue Cavern tank, which houses animals that live in the waters surrounding nearby Catalina Island.I got a kick out of viewing the “Amber Forest exhibit,” which replicates a Giant kelp forest with Garibaldi, California scorpion fish, and other representative organisms.We were equally fascinated with viewing their 211,000 gallon, Seal and Sea Lion Habitat, Ray Touch Pool, and Shorebird Sanctuary.In the Northern Pacific we observed the Sea Otter Habitat, a giant Pacific octopus tank; and Diving Birds, where puffins and auklets live. Other species on display included the Japanese spider crabs, jellyfish, and sea anemones.At the Tropical Pacific Gallery, which represent animals off the coast of the islands of Palau and has the aquarium's largest tank (350,000 gallon Tropical Reef Habitat). This tank houses the olive Ridley Sea Turtles, Zebra Sharks, Black tip Reef Sharks, to name just a few.I think one of our favorite exhibits was the Shark Lagoon, where there were over 100 sharks and rays. The main tank houses larger species such as rays, white tip reef sharks, nurse sharks, and sand tiger sharks, while the more docile Bamboo and epaulette sharks live in the three touch pools.I’m not sure of the exact order, but after lunch and numerous other exhibits, running in and out of the souvenir shops, cafeteria, etc., I can say that we all enjoyed a great time here at this attraction.",Holdtheair
40,Pleasant way to spend the morning!,We arrived when the gates opened at 9 AM on a Friday. Glad we did! We had the place to ourselves until about 11 AM when the crowds started to build up. Lots to see and learn. You could spend a little or a lot of time at each exhibit depending on much much reading you wanted to do. Both indoor and outdoors displays gave a really good overview of sea life. Very enjoyable!,Vicki K
50,Such a beautiful place.,This aquarium was a great place. It had hands on opportunities and learning activities. I would highly suggest visiting there because I did not want to leave!,Hreiher
50,Amazing sites for the kiddies,"This place is a treasure land for the kids. I have two girls, ages 5 & 6, and they never, ever get tired of visiting this place. The penguin exhibit is so enriching and educational - seeing them swimming and walking around just tickles my little girls pink! The hands-on activities such as touching the various sea creatures drives my girls wild! I really love how frequently things change, as the girls get to experience something new each time we visit.",skystar2
50,wow!!,very enjoyable experience! Amazing displays and very informative.definitely will return. The exhibits were great at promoting the health of the earth and necessity to protect all species of life.,kittymom2011
50,Enjoyed by All Ages,"Our party ranged in age from 4 to 69 and we all had a great experience. There are amazing tanks of fish-some of them huge. I have never seen such colorful species. The sea horse display was special-as well as the penguins, sharks and all the hands-on displays. My 4 and 6 year old grandsons enjoyed building and floating submarines. A large part of the aquarium is outdoors which was ideal on the beautiful, sunny day we were there. There were lots of chairs and benches both inside and out if anyone needed a rest. The building and outdoor areas were beautiful and well kept. I don't have anything negative to say about our visit. It is the best aquarium I have visited.",Barbara T
40,Good for kids & adults,Spent a day here with my husband. The exhibits were really well laid out and very interesting. If you are going without children then it may be a good idea to avoid the weekend as it was very busy. The free bus drops you off right outside an it is well worth a visit.,DrinaG
40,A nice afternon at the aquarium,"My wife, children and I had a nice time at the aquarium during an afternoon outing we had in Long Beach. The aquarium offers a lot of fun activities and sights for all to partake in. The only drawback to the overall experience is how they have it set-up to purchase your entrance tickets. It doesn't seem to be very organized nor is it covered. Be prepared to wait in line and in the sun, which is not great for young children or adults who may forget to bring a hat or cover-up. The manager's of the aquarium could stand to take a few lessons from Disneyland on line and entrance management.This is a definite place to visit again with the family.",SeanO
30,Unimpressionable,Not what I expected. My kids and I walked through the entire aquarium in less than an hour. For the price I was expecting more...,Marimar501
40,Very interesting Marine Life!!,"We really enjoyed the variety of Jelly fish & also all the different Seahorses! Very cool! Only issue is that we were there without children but there were many schools there with LOTS of kids which made it very difficult to see most of the exhibits. But we understand it's for kids too, so we just grinned & bared it!!! Might be nice to maybe have an adult only hour or something like that! Just a thought!",Caroline R
50,Aquarium volunteer diver,"This is the most engaging aquarium because of the staff, volunteers and inhabitants. The educational benefit is that you don't know what you don't know until you see something for the first time. With a volunteer right there to build the experience out with a questioning process that builds wonder, respect and stewardship for the pacific ocean and its inhabitants. If you are there on any Friday afternoon look me up...I could be feeding the fish in the Tropical Reef or Blue Cavern tanks. I hope to see you there.",Shunt0
50,One of the best aquariums you will ever see,"Amazing display of Pacific ocean life. The jellyfish displays are the best I have ever seen and make for a good photo op if you play with the lighting and patterns a bit. Really a great place to visit, one not to be missed!!",JackM62
50,Best Aquarium Ever,"This was the best aquarium I've ever been to. It's smaller than some, but has plenty of areas for you to view fish and water animals. The best part is that you can touch many of the animals in specific locations in the aquarium. We spent about 3 hours there, just my husband and I. Plan more time if you are taking children. And wear sunscreen! Much of it is outside.",Melissa M
50,"Fun, hands on, different","We have been to a few different aquariums and this one is by far the best. It has touch pools with certain animals so you can actually touch manta rays, small sharks, starfish, anemone, moon jellies and more! We went with our 2 teenage girls & we all had a lot of fun!",Heather F
40,Fun!,Lots to see. There's a mini spray park in the middle of the area for the kids to cool down. Great place to visit for a few hours,Bits58
40,Fun outing!,"The conference had a special rate for us and we only had a few hours, but it was fun! The penguins were very cute and the birds wery vwery funny!",ToniLerch
50,"Fish, feathers and other mammals","A gorgeous compound, well-staffed with knowledgeable folks, clean and most especially, wonderfully eco-friendly for the many inhabitants. Please do share in the beauty of the Lorikeet exhibit, the petting pool and other charming critters!",Michelle P
50,Wonderful way to spend an afternoon,"We went there on a Saturday afternoon, so it was very crowded. The exhibits are well laid out; you don't have to double back to see everything. Not as comprehensive as the Monterey Bay Aquarium, in my (uninformed) opinion, but still a great deal of visually very pleasing exhibits.",jde1953
40,Nice aquarium,"My husband and I love aquariums and thought we would visit here on our vacation. The aquarium was nice and had some great features. Highlights were the sea lions, penguins and the shark touch tank. This aquarium seemed on the smaller side but we had a nice time.",stephb6
50,"Lots of fun, hands-on experiences","The only thing wrong with the aquarium was way toooo many rude visitors, but that is not the aquariums fault and is partly ours since we went on a Saturday in the summer. But, despite that, we (myself, husband, 2 older sons) had an absolutely wonderful time. The exhibits are really well done, well kept, and there are a lot of opportunities for ""hands on"". I can't believe I ever managed to extract my son from the shark tank!The staff is excellent, really knowledgeable and very eager to answer any and all questions.We have been to many aquariums, all over the world, and are regular visitors at the Monterey Bay aquarium. While I don't think this is quite as good as Monterey, it comes very close.We spent over 3 hours here.",lanamom
40,"Nice aquarium, especially when our feet needed a break from Disney","Lots of great exhibits, both inside and out. Every 30 minutes they have a short movie that is projected on all the wall surfaces in the main hall, which was pretty cool. The touch tanks were great, and we got to pet sharks!!! Especially love the leafy dragons and the jellies. Wonderful gift shop as well. A little spendy, but they do take the AAA discount, and you can often find discount coupons in the area coupon books.",knhdah
40,Nice variety of exhibits,"We visited here while in town for a conference. The aquarium is near the waterfront and many eateries and some shops and a movie complex. the lorakeet exhibit is one of the better ones i have seen. the jellyfish and some of the reef exhibits with anemones, were also very good. while I may be spoiled by our aquarium (Chattanooga), I still think the design leaves something to be desired as it is somewhat challenging to navigate easily to get to see all of the exhibits without backtracking a little. Otherwise, a nice aquarium.",bills83au
50,"Excellent Small Aquarium with Lots of ""Touch"" Exhibits","It's been years since I've been to this Aquarium and took visiting family with young children here and found a completely updated facility. Lots more exhibits and lots of ""touch"" exhibits whether touching the moon jellyfish or feeding the bat rays. Everyone had a great time, adults and kids. If we lived closer to Long Beach, would absolutely join as members and visit often. Highly recommend for anyone with kids. Originally thought we'd only spend 1 hour here, ending up spending 3 hours here given all the different sea life.",LuvtoSafari
40,Nice little aquarium,"This is a nice little aquarium in downtown Long Beach. You can see everything in a couple of hours. It does get a little busy with field trips but if you go early you can avoid them by heading into different sections of the aquarium. There are touch tanks for the kids and the otters, sea lions, and penguins are quite adorable.",Daisy
40,Well done.,"We went on Father's Day. So, it was very crowded. But, they were well staffed, well trained and organized. The aquarium itself is gorgeous, really something you must experience.",Michael G
50,Beautiful Aquarium!,"This is definately worth seeing, the aquarium has lots to see and do. If you have children or grandkids take them there, that will make it a day to remember for both of you.",Paul O
50,Fun for Adults 2,"Really enjoyed a recent visit here.Been awhilethe programs have greatly expandedLIKE the Lobster feed time and when divers are in main Shark Tank""Otters still cuteView Deck Bar nicehighly recommend",P-and-A-Belmont
50,Aquarium of the Pacific - the Most Fascinating in the World,"From the tiniest to the largest, forms of sea life I never saw before are here. To see everything one can half a day here. The sea horse and sea dragon tanks are awesome. From sea birds to sea lions and penguins outside to huge sea tanks and small exhibits inside. Within walking distance there are fine restaurants. Besides the Aquarium there are other attractions, hotels and bars close by. Long Beach is wonderful.",bollbar
50,Best Aquarium,"I have seen Monterrey, Dallas, and other aquariums. This is hands down the best. Children and adults love the interaction and the exhibits are spectacular. The petting zoo was unbelievable. Plan half day minimum.",Bob S
50,Worth the visit to see the life in the Pacific,"This is a large facility with a lot of animal life to see. There are sea birds, sea lions and penguins outside. Inside there are large and small exhibits of all of the life in the pacific. I especially liked the sea horse and sea dragon tanks. The sea otters were in a huge indoor tank that one could see below the water. The aquarium was a great visit.",Martin C
40,Good place for kids,This place is a great place for kids to learn about the Pacific. Lots of hands on exhibits. Go early as it can get crowded. The jelly fish exhibits are really cool. Make sure to see all the weird types of sea dragons. Only takes a couple of hours so you can check out the other attractions in the area.,petiedogtravels
50,I love this aquarium,I had not been to this aquarium since I was a child and it was as good as I remember it. They have many wonderful exhibits and it is a great way to spend half your day. It leaves you with an impression from the moment you enter and see the huge blue whale hanging from the ceiling. They have a wide variety of marine life and seem to take care of them well. I definitely recommend this attraction if you are in the Long Beach area!,AshleySchulte
40,Worth the visit,"The Aquarium of the Pacific was one of the reasons we went to long beach for a long weekend, and we had a great time spending most of the day there. There are a lot of exhibits and sea life on display, most of which you'd expect at an aquarium but this one seemed to have all of them there. All in all, a great diversion to enjoy and appreciate the ocean.",Travis Schulte
30,Cool place to check out,"This aquarium was ok. It definitely had a few unique exhibits but overall it was a lot like others that I've been to. I did especially like the moon jelly fish exhibit, because they let you touch them. There are also a couple of other hands on exhibits. It would be a great place to take kids! We must have chosen a day when a lot of schools or day cares went because there were a ton ok kids there, which was a little annoying because they were running and yelling all over the place. make sure u take your parking garage ticket and they will validate it for you and then it's only 8 dollars.",Paula0478
50,So much more then we thought!,This place is so cool we want to take our family their. They let you be very hands on. Super clean and nice. They have a snack bar and restaurant with lots of bathrooms throughout the aquarium. Right off the beach and a nice walk to a lighthouse!,Rosemary T
50,Excelent place to visit!,If you enjoy nature and marine life then this is a place for you! There were lots of new sea creatures that I had not seen before. I have a 6 year old daughter and it had enough attraction for us to spend about 4-5 hours there.,Katy Y
40,Lots of touch tanks and mammals!,"We missed our ferry to Catalina Island and had an hour to kill before the next one so we headed over to the Aquarium of the Pacific and arrived just before they opened. My husband and I visited the Monterey Bay Aquarium a few months before and we really didn't expect much from a much smaller and less famous place, but we love these kinds of things and ended up pleasantly surprised. Of course there are tons of fish, but my favorite part of aquariums like this is seeing the mammals up close and having the chance to touch things. There were seals, sea lions and an awesome otter exhibit (plus cool shark and penguin exhibits)! The seals stop by the windows to play with you (track your finger in circles) and generally look like they're having a good time. However, my favorite part had to be the touch tanks. I've pet sharks and rays before at various aquariums (and in the wild!), but I'd never had the chance to touch jellyfish and it was pretty cool. It's a small place, because it wasn't crowded when we arrived we saw the whole thing in about 40 minutes, as we were leaving it started to get crowded and I can imagine we wouldn't have enjoyed it as much if we hadn't arrived when we did. Definitely a cool place, but arrive as early as possible for the best experience. Monterey Bay Aquarium is worth braving the crowds for, this place not quite as much hence the 4 and not 5 stars.",Joy M
50,Absolutely amazing!,"The place is absolutely fabulous, and the species of fish shown is amazing. Its a place where one would want to spend the entire day, with several informative shows being showcased in a round robin fashion. Nicely done and maintained. The volunteers are so dedicated and are successful in getting across valuable message to save the ocean, and fish. Very educative and beautiful.",BeduinMon
40,Better Than Expected!,"We had a wonderful family outing at the aquarium. I was pleasantly surprised at the exhibits that they had. My favorite by far were the jellyfish! I've never seen so many at any aquarium before and in so many sizes! There is also a shark lagoon with a wide variety of species, penguins,and two touch tanks that have horseshoe crabs, sea anemones and even small sharks! Kids big & small and parents will love this place! The staff was friendly and they have a very nice gift shop as well.Tips: Parking was easy and convenient in the parking garage across the street ($8 if you validate inside the aquarium). Best time to go is weekday late afternoon (you avoid the weekend crowd and field trips). Easy to navigate with a stroller (and they can see a lot without you taking them out of the stroller!) Buy and print tickets online to avoid lines when you arrive. (You can also buy a discounted ticket online if you plan to go to the aquarium and the zoo in the same year!)",MayaD888
40,Nice Aquarium!,"We took a 3 year old here. He had a great time especially with the option of touching the sharks, and sting rays. They are very child friendly and there were shows going on constantly.",savanhub .
40,Worth a Visit,"Well worth a visit if you are in the area, some nice tanks and they have sea otters as well. There is also a section outside with birds and a shark/ray tank.",Mark W
50,Amazing Sea Lion Encounter!!!,My partner took me here whilst we were down Long Beach and as a surprise I had a Sea Lion Experience where we were able to Feed/Train the Sea Lion called Parker. This was an amazing experience and would highly recommend to do it as it may be once in a life time to be kissed by a 360lbs Sea Lion! The rest of the Aquarium itself has areas where you are able to touch certain Fishes/Rays which is also really good!,RoxyJade
40,family fun,We had a really fun time at the Aquarium of the Pacific. it only takes about 3 hours to see the entire aquarium so I suggest getting there when they open to avoid the crowds. Otters and sea lions we very active and entertaining. Loved the Lorikeet Forrest and feeding the birds. Don't miss out on petting the sting rays and sharks!,Jessica K
50,Wow- world of wonder,"Learn about sea creatures of the Pacific. This Aquarium is hands down, one of the best Aquariums I have visited. It features indoor and outdoor exhibits, multiple touch tanks, multiple and varied show choices throughout the day, super friendly and knowledgeable staff. This is a great educational experience for all ages!",SMJ46
40,Well Done Exhibits,"Worth the visit, lots of kids. But hey, you can touch sharks and rays. We enjoyed it. Easy walk from out hotel, nice surroundings. Take a coupon with you to save money...",RCuevas
40,A small fish in big aquarium,I enjoyed it even though it was pretty crowded. I enjoyed the variety of species and the way the aquarium was laid out.,Jim M
40,Very entertaining,"Whenever I'm in the area, I try to make it a point to visit the Aquarium. It is a relaxing yet informative place to go; I learn something new every time I go. It's well worth the trip.",Lddogg
40,A quick distraction,If you have to kill an hour or 2 and you happen to be in the Long Beach area then this might be a good distraction for you. It's located by shoreline village which offers a great view of the Queen Mary. There's plenty of parking and food around the area.You place offers a variety of exhibits and recently they started to have more hands on displays. The curators are very knowledgeable and encourages everyone to ask as much questions as they have. The goal is to really educate everyone about the ocean and how to help save it. Most of the displays are indoor which makes it nice if you're not a big fan of the outdoor scene. It's a bit pricey but then again it's not something you do everyday.,RickInOC
50,Very nice indoor/outdoor experience!,"And a great deal! Buying a family membership paid off for us because we got 6 people admission plus it was tax-deductible! Bring your sunscreen because some of it is outdoors. Beautiful aquariums, nice hands-on features, and an enjoyable time for all ages. Free wheelchairs also.",BBH314
40,Great Experience for the Whole Family!,"The ticket prices are a little high, in my opinion, but you do get a pretty enjoyable experience from this aquarium. I've been twice now and the exhibits are very enjoyable. My four year old son is enthralled with almost all of the displays. They have a good amount of hands on activities as well.This place is very good for families with kids. Adults without kids might want to pass on this experience.",MeisterTibbs
40,great for the kids,"Took our three year old grandson last week he was captivated by all the fish, this is a great place and attraction for all ages, they have a huge selection of fish and other animals, it is well laid out and easy to get to well sign posted. Good value for money especially if you book on line and get one of the offers we got the Aquarium and Zoo packege, hope the Zoo is as good as the Aquarium.",john h
40,Nice Place to Take Visiting Friends and Family,"If you want to take out-of-town visitors to a nice, California attraction without paying a fortune or having to spend all day at an amusement park, check out the Aquarium of the Pacific. If you get there early in the morning, you will have lots of space to enjoy all of the exhibits and be able to see everything by noon. If you go later in the day, there are lots and lots of people.When you are done with the museum, check out the Harbour Cruise next door. It takes you on a nice, 45-minute boat ride around Long Beach. You can buy tickets for both on the Aquarium's website. It makes for a nice outing where people can see CA's famous sea lions, sharks and fish AND get to actually go on a boat.",FemaleTraveler902
30,Smaller than expected,"I was pretty disappointed, to be honest. It was just OK, and only took about 1.5 hours to see everything. The best part was the interactive session with one of the divers while they were feeding the sharks.",yashinfan
20,Adults can see everything in less than one hour,Lots of small kids and strollers made it hard for our group of 4 adults to move through the venue. Seals and penguins were neat but the viewing glass was dirty meaning no pictures. Lots of crowded hands on areas for small kids but not many large viewing areas for adults. Was overpriced for time we spent here (about 45 mins).,Stacy W
50,Magical aquarium for all ages.,I go to a lot of aquariums and this is by far one of the best I've been to. Great exhibits. The highlights for us were the shark touch pools and the sea otter feeding. The only downside is that it's a popular destination and it gets very very busy!,mrboldies
40,"Interactive Aquarium, our family really enjoyed it!","There seems to be frequent complaints on the price of admission. Considering we just paid $53 for our family of 4 to go in the Soviet Submarine at Queen Mary for 15 minutes (very cool by the way), spending $100 for our family got us over 3 1/2 hours of education and entertainment seems like quite the value.So many exhibits are interactive...shark pools, jelly fish, starfish....I think there are 4 or 5 touch areas. My 12 year old son was beyond thrilled with the entire place...my 18 year old Biology freak girl loved it too. The walk in aviary is awesome. Be prepared for birds to want to come up and play with you! Penguins and sea otters are more favorites.There is a cafe, a gift shop and a coffee area...plenty of bathrooms. Very clean. There are plenty of ramps and elevators if you have a guest that need it.For $8 we parked in the adjacent structure, and we road the free big red bus across the bridge to sight see Queen Mary and The Scorpion Sub. The bus runs almost constantly in a loop...Shoreline Village , the aquarium, Queen Mary. Pleasant way to spend the day!",Michelle_Haley
40,Interacting with nature,"From petting Jelly Fish and sharks to feeding birds, this aquarium is full of fun and educational exhibits. The staff are vary knowledgeable and friendly. The cost of admission is well worth the 3 to 4 hrs you will spend there.",Kevin F
40,Great Aquarium,"We went to the Aquarium after an unsuccessful whale watching trip.Overall a really nice place, pretty informative and a huge variety of sealife. We got to pet little sharks and watch bigger sharks and other fish being hand-fed by divers. The place was however full of kids, which was pretty annoying and made it really loud.I wasnt overly impressed with the place though...then again i have been to the aquarium in Baltimore which is like 4 times the size.But you sould definitely stop by when you're in Long Beach.",Norm T
50,Enjoyed it,"The seals were adorable, could have played with them for hours. They follow your hands like a cat chasing a feather. Very nice place. Close to the ferry for Catalina too. We have been to a lot of aquariums and found this to be quite different and entertaining. It also didn't feel crammed with people the flow was quite good!",deltadwn27
40,Great aquarium to spend a few hours in.,"I'd definitely recommend the Aquarium of the Pacific (Long Beach Aquarium) to anyone in the area who appreciate sealife and want to burn a few hours. It can get busy, so weekdays and non-holidays are probably best.",chutrain
50,One of the better aquariums I've been to,"This is one of the best aquariums I've been to. Not the biggest but they have some very cool stuff to see. Lots of interaction... You can touch many of the rays, sharks, starfish, etc... The bird area was a lot of fun too! We even got to see penguins up close! So much fun!",runningtravelers
40,The Pacific Oceans Marine Life seems so much more colourful!,This place was packed! Very popular! Everyone had fun seeing the marine life exhibits! Very Informative! They also have touch tanks which allows kids to be kids! A nice small bird attraction as well! Parking is available and remember to validate your ticket at the Marina gate!,Cliff P
50,Marvelous aquarium,This is one of the best aquariums in the country -- be sure to catch as many of their shows as you can!,Karen K
30,Great little Aquarium,"This Aquarium is a great stop roof you in long beach. I too 2 twin 4 year olds and the had a great time tuning around looking at all to see, only down side was that the aquarium is small, guess I'm just spoiled after visiting Monterey bay aquarium several times, but still if you have not been to a aquarium in a while this one is worth a shot.",Salaamus
40,Well Worth The Visit,"Lots and lots of Pacific aquatic life to view. Very child friendly. Gift shop is mostly geared to children. Seals, sharks, rays abound. Strongly recommend.",jrjojo
50,Fun for the whole family,"A great attraction in the Los Angeles area. You could spend as little as a few hours or spend the entire day here and will still have things to see. Kids will love the giant tank at the entrance, as well as exploring all the different rooms. Outside are fun petting tanks and bird houses.",Janice N
50,Fun especially for kids!,My daughter and I had a great bonding time at the Aquarium of the Pacific. The 4D movie was awesome! Great location.,welovetotravel20
50,Excellent Value,Loved this aquarium in Long Beach. Staff were very informative and enjoyed watching the fish being fed. Well stocked shop. Spent 3 hours here.,Penny E
50,Hours of fun an Learning,"My husband and I have been to a few different aquariums both on the west and east coasts. We really enjoyed our time here finding out about and seeing creatures and fish that we have never seen before. There are interactive stations where you can touch Jelly Fish, Sting Ray, sharks, Etc. the Sea Otter exhibit and Sea Lions are my personal favorites. This is a good activity for young and old alike. I did notice that there is a cafe, Jamba Juice, etc. If you want to eat at the Aquarium.",KRL32
50,Small but worth it,"The aquarium itself was small,but so much fun.It was such a different venue, I was surprised to be able to touch jellyfish, and hammerhead sharks. It is a great way to spend the day. It was informative and everybody that worked at the aquarium was so pleasant. I would go back again",amand l
40,Gorgeous place!,"This is a wonderful little aquarium located on the beautiful harbor of Long Beach. I particularly like the jellyfish exhibits and the wonders of the deep exhibits. Although it is not that big, it is very well presented. Go to the back also to see the colorful lorikeets and the shark exhibits. If you are hands-on type of person, there are areas where you can touch the animals. You can also enjoy boat tours near by. I had the 45-minute tour of the harbor. Really enjoy that also.",RainbowCowboy
30,Do the behind the scenes tour!,"If you decide to go you have to try the behind the scenes tour. It is absolutely worth the extra money. We even got to feed some of the fish seaweed and watch the stingrays eat lunch. There are a lot of ""please touch"" exhibits including sharks, stingrays, and starfish. The aquarium was really crowded on a Saturday and I think expensive. Try going early in the morning to avoid more of the crowds. Not the best aquarium I've been to but not the worst. Check out my blog for a full review and more photos at http://msvaleriesmith.blogspot.com",vjs5031
50,The setting is gorgeous,The fish and other creatures have a wonderful home at the LB Aquarium. There are so many things to look at and yet the entire enterprise is manageable. It's great for kids of all ages!,Anne P
50,Love this place!,"This aquarium has so many different things there is something everyone will like: tropical fish, jellies, sharks (you can touch!), birds (you can feed!), otters, and best of all... Leafy Sea Dragons. Even the fast food cafe has decent food and the spacious gift shop has all kinds of wonderful things.",yaloobloo
50,Excellent manageable aquarium,"I have taken my grandchildren to this aquarium, and they have always loved it. I recommend going immediately after the aquarium opens or on a weekday afternoon. Then you will miss the big school crowds and have a peaceful environment. The docents are very friendly, patient with the children and very knowledgeable.",Carol K
50,Awesome! Everyone should take this tour.,Love love love this place!!! On a date or with the kids (grandkids too!). There's lots of other places to eat and sites to see around the aquarium.,Ingrid M
40,My daughter loved it!,We went early in the morning just as the doors opened. This allowed us to fully enjoy the aquariums and exhibits without the large crowds. That had a large variety of unique species. This is not an all day activity. 3 hours and we were done.,missmargoann
40,Great family day,"We had a great visit here. There is a big enough variety for young kids as well as older children and adults. There are plenty of touch exhibits as well as a variety of sea life. We also ate lunch at the cafe Nd it was quite good. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The only glitch was the parking. Normally the garage is right there and easy to access. However,they were prepping for the Long Beach Grand Prix and they had closed off the roads. We found. Parking and they provided a shuttle bus but added extra steps. Check the dates before you go! Price was reasonable and they do. Give discounts of various kinds.",sueajp
10,Not worth it,"For nearly $30 per adult you'd think this place would be spectacular. Unfortunately, this was one of the worst I've been to. We went on a Sunday during international children's day, which I thought would be great for my 1 year old. NOPE. Terribly overcrowded and understaffed. Parents thought this was a daycare and let their kids run around like crazy with zero supervision. The aquarium itself is terribly designed, I would hate it even if there were no other people as you cannot see to move around, the decor is so outdated and worn and the outdoor water area is falling apart. Definitely skip this one and go to the LA Zoo instead!!!",Esayed84
50,One of the Best,"This aquarium located in Long Beach is really one of the finest I have seen. It has three concentrations, South Pacific, North Pacific and the tropical pacific. I especially loved the sea horses and sea dragons. They have various special shows throughout the day. I went back a second time to do one of the twice daily behind the scene tours. This should be done by adults or older teens for full benefit. I love the full 88 foot,true to,size blue,whale in the main hall. The gift shop offers varied price items to fit all budgets. They have a movie,shown for,extra cost. They also,have a food,service,option at 2 locations. This should be given at least 3 hours. Touch a shark,hold birds, play in water spurt areas. All in all a great place for,the family.",101NDTraveler2013
20,Definitely not worth a visit!,"Poorly designed, understaffed, overcrowded and overpriced!Many years after the Long Beach Aquarium was built, after devastating reviews from our teenage daughter (who is a marine biology nut), we finally visited. A group I belong to arranged cut-rate admission -- I am very glad we didn't pay the full price!The aquarium is set in a good location -- plenty of parking (although the day were were there it took 30 minutes to go from the freeway off-ramp to the lot due to come kind of construction), lots of restaurants, other attractions nearby. But, both the designer and the current management need to rethink their goals.Many (too many) of the exhibits have viewing windows not much larger than modern day televisions (and I am not talking the giant ones). If one person stands in front of the exhibit, then no one can see anything. During our visit the problem was exacerbated by guests photographing the exhibit with their cameras or tablets, making the only way to see the exhibit to watch what was happening on the other guest's screen! Unlike many museums, there are not extensive informational displays. Most museum goers have become used to interactive stations where one can gain additional information. Most of the tanks have little more than the name of the fish contained, with one poster for a group of displays/tanks. Some of the tanks were placed so that one had to stand on tiptoes to see anything -- I don't know how a child could have seen the specimens without a parental lift. I am not short (5'6"") but had trouble with some.The larger, indoor tanks had aisles with ropes guiding guests to walk in front of them, almost single file when strollers are in the mix. Talk about bad traffic control! One fussy toddler, who chose that moment to sit on the floor, blocked everyone from approaching for at least 5 minutes. Additionally, the signs that identify fish are placed so that one has to go back and forth in front of the exhibit to read them, further affecting traffic flow.The large tanks are quite small by Sea World or Monterrey Bay Aquarium standards. and, they seem overcrowded by fish. The overcrowding, both in numbers and types of fish, may please some guests, but seems quite unnatural. Having dived and snorkeled in many of the environments presented, the density of fish was several orders of magnitude larger than in the wild, and far more dense than is found in most aquariums. I felt sorry for one of the sharks who could not move its tail without disturbing multiple schools of fish and could not swim for 10 feet without having to turn.Then there is the staff, or lack there of. There is a troop of youngsters (like you would find in your local multiplex movie theater) who perform such tasks as collecting tickets, but not much beyond that. Getting our group's tickets, although they had been pre-ordered, took over 20 minutes. Lines were ridiculous.As for professional staff, we didn't see any. There was a purported talk at one of the tanks, but the only content was the diver talking with the moderator (another ""theater type"" staff member) about how to become a volunteer! Questions about the fish went, largely, unanswered. Guests were encouraged to ""high five"" the diver, further affecting congestion!There are a few outdoor exhibits, including a ray petting tank, but, again, the only staff was a ""life guard"" (complete with a whistle and a guard tower) to keep people out of the pool. The penguins were cute, but the viewing window was so splashed with salt water and the resulting crystals that the birds were hard to see.We went to one ""movie"", the only free one, and found the documentary to be dry and without interest, even to our educated minds. We like almost anything that has some content, but this video was empty, beyond the names of a few famous oceanographers encouraging exploration.In general, the building is poorly designed, has low, dark hallways that are far too small for the number of guests present, and ridiculously loud, making conversation difficult. (Think of a grotto that would have been best explored by a couple, but was packed, wall to wall, by a football crowd!) The day we were there it was almost impossible to walk through any of the exhibits at our pace (slow). Most areas were wall to wall people, with strollers fighting for space as well. We came close to tripping, several times, on tired children who sprawled on the floor. The ""great hall"", which could be a lovely large open space, is crowded by restaurants, with tables and chairs surrounded by a chain. Simply navigating to the restrooms (off the hall) was difficult. To make the congestion worse, there were face painting and origami stations in the hall the day we went.The Aquarium needs to rethink its purpose. It offers neither the entertainment of Sea World (which, contrary to expectations, has more educational content than does the Aquarium) nor the strongly science-based and educational exhibits of the Monterrey Bay Aquarium. We have a choice --- drive 1.5 hours, spend 30 minutes in a traffic jam parking, or drive 4 hours to Monterrey and spend the night in a hotel. In future, we will do the latter.",Sarita
40,friendly lorikeets,"We took our daughters to the aquarium on a Thursday during their spring break. There was no line at 10am.TIP: You can save 10% by showing your AAA card at the ticket window. If you want to save more, go to http://www.aquariumofpacific.org/web_coupon/information/visaspecialYou will save $6 off an adult admission of $28.95 and $2 off a children's admission of $14.95. This offer expires 12/31/14.We enjoyed all the different displays of fish. My long-time favorites, jellyfish, are still beautiful, fluorescent, and mesmerizing. We enjoyed the penguins, seals, and the petting area, with bonnethead sharks and rays.I highly recommend the lorikeets. We paid $3 for a cup of nectar, which is a small price for a lot of entertainment. As soon as we entered the sanctuary, two lorikeets landed on my daughter, who was holding the nectar. The lorikeets are fearless and right at home on your arm or shoulder. The lorikeets lapped up the nectar with their long tongue. Even after the nectar was gone, one friendly lorikeet stayed on my shoulder, exploring my hat and hood. It was quite ticklish!It was a day of fun with the family. Don't miss the lorikeets if you go. The reason why it received 4 stars was the price, but aquariums are pricey in every city we have visited.",Matthew J
40,Nice Aquarium,"Pretty nice aquarium with several locations where you could actually touch some of the wildlife. The shows are short presentations to inform people about the animals in question. I thought the price was a little high, but it is to preserve the wildlife so I guess it's ok.",Cory G
40,"A bit pricey, but a great aquarium!","This is a great aquarium, lots of wonderful exhibits and animals. The ""shows"" aren't really ""shows"" if you are comparing them to something like Sea World shows, but are more like presentations. We enjoyed the shark feeding one and the seals/sea lions one. They are informative, but won't really keep young kids interested for too long. The price of admission is pretty steep, but we had a coupon which made it more reasonable. I just googled ""aquarium of pacific coupon"" and found several printable ones easily. Add on paying parking and food and gift shop and all the extras and it can be a pretty expensive day, but it was fun to do once. We went in the afternoon on a school day and all the field trip groups were leaving so we pretty much had the place to ourselves. We spent about 3 hours there.",DCP75
50,Fun spot for free Friday evening events,"We were only in the area one night after flying into Long Beach, and had read about the aquarium's free Friday night programs. This particular Friday event allowed visitors into the shark petting area. The tanks have a variety of small, young sharks and skates, as well as other sea life. It was quite well attended, and still our 4 young children ages 2-6 were able to find spots where they could touch and observe these amazing creatures. They did not want to leave when it was over, even though their clothes were wet and they were starting to shiver as it got cooler when the sun went down. Our 6 yr old grandson fell into the tank with baby hammerhead sharks and skates!! He did not heed the staff warnings to keep his feet on the floor while reaching to touch the fish. He was not hurt, nor were the fish, and the staff were very kind and understanding toward him about the incident. They brought towels to dry him off. We all had lots of laughs over it later!!",Daniel S
30,Average Aquarium,"Cost: $28 per adultLocation: great, easy to access, the free passport bus goes there, near restaurantsCons: over run with 100's of child strollers. So many block and clog the aisles and aquarium tank areas so it makes it hard to get up close and move through the facility. Lots of bottleneck areas. Tons of very, very loud kids. If you have ever been to a Ripleys Aquarium this is about the same.Pros: enjoyed the sea otters, sea lions, and outside bird exhibit.",ShortBuckle
40,Great Aquarium in manageable package,"As compared to other Aquariums (at last count I've been to 19, in 4 countries) thisone a bit larger than the median, which makes it easy to do in one visit.There's a lot of variety for it's size. It is educationally based, rather than ""Disney-like"".And there are lots of kid-friendlyactivities and extras.There are tons of restaraunt choices in the immediate area.And look for discount couponsin the usual places.",Trent W
40,Lots to see,"On the public transportation route. many indoor and outdoor exhibits to explore. Narrated shows occur at different exhibits all day. Food and restrooms on site. Photography is encouraged. Try to avoid visiting when school field trips are there, as it gets nooisy and crowded.",Wanderingwindsorite
50,Great affordable museum visit,"A very clean and lovely aquarium. Very specific to the types of sea life of the Pacific Ocean. One can touch stingrays, small sharks, and jellyfish. A lot of fun was had in the lorikeet bird exhibit, where the birds can land on your arm and drink nectar from your hand (available for purchase). Didn't get a chance to see any scheduled presentations. Decent food available. Discount coupons are easy to acquire from the local hotels and Long Beach tourism center.",Ponyboy_chicago
40,Fun and educational outing,"My two girls and I have visited the Aquarium numerous times as we live somewhat nearby. It is one of the nicest Aquariums in the state with sealife arranged by area (e.g. Baja California), educational talks (e.g. on otters or seals) with demonstrations, and frequent festivals with fun crafts--so lots to see and do. There is a cool touch tank where you can touch stingrays (stingers removed) and (small) sharks. There's also a nice gift shop and reasonable cafeteria on the premises. Weekends, however, are fairly crowded so get there early or go on the weekdays. Very highly recommended for a children's activity.",OCfoodie92648
50,Between rain drops,"We were in California for a short time and of course it rained the whole time we were there. Thank God we found out about the aquarium because we had 4 kids with us. It was fun for all the kids. We had 2 teenagers and 2 toddlers and they all enjoyed it very much. We even got to interact with a penguin, it was very cool and educational. Having so many kids with us we thought it would be expensive and it turned out to be pretty reasonable. Great memories for all.",Evelyn B
50,The place for plaice!,"Not cheap, but an excellent aquarium. A wide variety of creatures in good tanks. Lots of schoolchildren, but on the whole well controlled and well behaved. We are retired teachers so try to avoid school trips now! Saw things we've not seen before. We were other for about 2 hours which was about right.",Rutlandlass
30,Nice Aquarium,"This is a very nice aquarium with many opportunities for petting the animals. The large tank when you first enter the building is impressive and there are often volunteer divers in there to show you certain fish. They can talk to an MC through a microphone system so you can ask them questions and they can explain things.The seals are also fun to watch as are the otters. A lot of the aquarium is outside, so try to go on a nice day.",Kate0206
30,Not the best aquarium I've visited but still entertaining,"We are a family of 2 adults and a 6 yo. We went with a BOGO from the Entertainment book and 10% off of the kids ticket with AAA. If we paid full price my review may not have been as positive but we had a great time. There are plenty of unusual species to see especially since we are East Coasters. The touch tank was a big hit too, my son like touching the bonnet-head(?) shark the most. We also enjoyed feeding the Lorikeets even though it was extra. We went at a very leisurely pace, watched a couple of show and even repeated some of the exhibits and we were there for about 4 hours. I would say I may be slightly disappointed after visiting but overall we enjoyed ourselves. I just thought they'd have a little more. The other issue I had was there were (under-chaperoned) kids field trips going on so it was very crowded and a bit loud. If you have any trepidation about visiting Long Beach due to the what you've heard about gang activity I can assure you the aquarium is in a very safe area with it's own parking garage with security on every floor.",OlympicMike
50,A top notch attraction.,It is very easy to get around. At the information desk they can let you know when the different events are happening. In the main hall the 3 story tank is amazing. As the diver is in the tank he talks to the observers. Out the rear doors they have a shallow area where you can touch some of the fish. Way cool. Plan to spend some time in the giftshop.,articusblue
50,"Large, diverse and well worth it","We decided to go to the aquarium on our trip long before reading any reviews, and were slightly apprehensive going into it seeing mentions of it being a short trip, light on exhibits, etc. What we found is that could not be further from the truth!! From numerous fish displays grouped to major categories, to multiple touch tanks, outdoor exhibits of birds, sharks penguins and sea lions and seals (with a show) we were entertained for nearly two hours before even checking what time it was, and still spent almost an additional hour. Had our 3 year old not been ready for a nap, we could have easily spent another 2-3 hours. It is somewhat expensive, but caring for marine life in a responsible way is an expensive pursuit, so well worth it. The diversity of displays was incredible. I've been to a lot of aquariums and there were a number of species there I had never seen live before. Two thumbs way up for this one!!",basst82
50,Awesome place!,My family had spent three days at Disneyland and I was looking to relax and enjoy the ocean! This place was on the way and loked awesome from the pamphlet in our hotel. We all had a great time! There was plenty of things to see and do out whole group was entertained (ranging in age from 1-60). My only complaint is we didn't plan enough time there! That was our fault because we wanted to spend time at the beach too. The staff was even helpful in directing us to a good place to go. Thank you!,lytzhyk
50,A Must See!,"Like sharks? Whales? Jellyfish? Want to learn more than you can anywhere else about the ocean? Then a trip to the Aquarium of the Pacific is a must! One can spend hours wandering around the big Aquarium building, viewing everything from huge sharks to nearly microscopic creatures that dwell miles below the ocean's surface. Be advised: this location hosts bus loads of school children every day! If you don't enjoy the noise and commotion they bring, plan your trip for after lunch.",Genius09
40,Nice Aquarium; Small and crowded,"This is the nicest aquarium in the LA area but it is on the small side and you can see everything in less than 2 hours. If you have young kids its a good short day trip. If you don't have kids you will feel crowded and want to get out of the sea of people.If you can do it, the Aquarium in Monterey, CA is better and bigger but it too gets very crowded so best to get there when it opens.Take the family on a boat trip (Harbor Breeze) across the path from the aquarium - more time and less money and a better natural experience.",ItchyFeet
30,"Small, crowded and overpriced",The aquarium can be completely covered in about an hour. This makes it a poor value when considering the price of parking and admission. Food is rather expensive so bring your own or visit some of the others places nearby.,wosli3
40,Kids will like it!,Good for a family! Maybe two or three hours if you have little ones. Parking is $8 per car with validation. You must see the sea otter exhibit! Food is a bit pricey but descent.,travelcrazy_365
50,Sealife to See and Enjoy,"The Aquarium of the Pacific is a fun-filled, enjoyable, informative place to visit. It is packed with educational materials presented in an attractive aquatic showcase of marine sealife. Hands-on and please touch exhibits are great for both adults and children and the tanks and exhibits are meticulously maintained to provide a realistic view of the environment in which the creatures can be found. Playful sea otters, seals and sea lions will enchant while tanks of sharks, rays and colorful fish attract children and adults to touch and feel their bodies. Plenty of docents are on hand to answer questions and provide direction when needed.Excellent signage off the 405 and 710 freeways makes finding the museum easy while ample parking in the parking garage and a museum validation allow one to park all day for 8.00--a real bargain.We spent an easy 3 hours in the exhibits and since it was such a beautiful day, we decided to amble around the waterfront area taking in the various sights including the lighthouse and theQueen Mary which is permanent drydock there. Overall, it was a great day enjoying these Long Beach offerings.",PAAbee
40,Better than I expected!,"Definitely not your average aquarium! With both indoor and outdoor areas, we saw everything from the smallest jellyfish to sharks and giant sting rays. Parking is easily situated right next to the aquarium and nearby restaurants are also a plus if you're not interested in the aquariums small cafe.",Chelsey B
40,Must visit for aficionados of our Natural History !,"I was on a business trip to Long Beach and I had a full morning at my disposal. I have stayed at Downtown Long Beach before and never had the opportunity before to visit this wonderful place. As my title says Aquarium of the Pacific is a must visit for people who appreciate our Natural History, especially for children - who will have a great time here indeed.The aquarium in my opinion is one of the best in this part of the world and they have a humungous collection of species from all over the pacific. The aquarium is divided into North Pacific, Southern California, Tropical Pacific, etc. I initially planned to spend about an hour at the aquarium, but ended up spending close to 3+ hrs and was still hesitant to come out !I really loved the exhibits where they allowed us to feel the Starfishes, Sea Snails and other aquatic animals. I also got to touch the jelly fishes and some sharks in their exclusive and amazing touch pools ! They also have a wide variety of other amazing collections of Abalones, Spider Crabs (really huge ones), Sea Crabs, Sea Horses, etc. They also have a great collection of Rays, Sharks and Sea lions where you can spend hours. There are highly motivated group of volunteers who will explain several exhibits in great detail and you can interact with them if you have the time.I loved every bit of it would love to go back again with my family and I am confident that the kids will surely enjoy it.",Aditya R
50,Fun and Interesting Visit,"I attended a catered business conference dinner at the aquarium just over a week ago. This turned out to be a wonderful venue for the event and it was truly enjoyed by all. Yes, it is a comparatively small aquarium complex but it has a large variety of fish and is jam packed with very well done tank displays and exhibits. Members of our conference came from about 25 states and all those I spoke with expressed their very positive impression of the aquarium.I've been to bigger, and maybe slightly better, aquariums in Calif. and other states but must give the Aquarium of the Pacific high marks for what they have put together in Long Beach. This is a top notch experience and well worth a visit. It's outright fun and It's a fantastic venue for an event dinner !",O2006
50,Great for the Children!,"I took my fourth grade class several years and I was never disappointed. Super facility with a wonderful staff that kept the children engaged and excited. Very hands-on! Still go back to see the jellies. As good as Monterey, which I think is the best in the world.",klondikespal
50,Excellent array of Pacific fish,This is a must visit if one is in or near Long Beach. The amount of fish & mammals is well worth a look. We especially enjoyed the interactions with the divers in the tanks feeding the fish & sting rays. This is a world class aquarium & the Rainbow Harbor it is located near has many other attractions & restaurants.,Chester D
50,Great for families - combined ticket with whalewatching tour a must!,"WOW! We had a fabulous day here and bought a combined ticket with a whale-watching tour - not must extra but three hours out in the Pacific during whale migration season was priceless. The children were amazed as were we. Grey whales, seals, and dozens of dolphins spotted and the boat's staff were very informative.",Planethayley
30,Nice smaller aquarium,Convenient location and worth a visit. But the California coast has some world-class aquariums such as Monterey and Scripps within a weekend drive.,David R
40,Great Aquarium to learn at,"Lots of hands on experiences; our 4 year old touched a jelly fish, sting ray, a few sharks and many inverts that were in the petting pools. From the outside you can't really tell how big the aquarium is, and I was shocked once we left the main building to find more exhibits outside.The shark tank was pretty cool and one shark had its mouth open where you could see all the teeth, scared my son, but very cool!Lots of friendly staff and videos and knowledge factoids scattered throughout.",Trevor S
50,"OUTSTANDING AQUARIUM, LARGE, MANY LIVE PRESENTATIONS","My wife and I spent a good part of a day at the aquarium. We have been to numerous aquariums around the world (Barcelona, several in Florida, Baltimore, San Diego, several Sea Worlds etc.)and we were pleasantly surprised as how extensive the collection of animals was here and how informative the presentations were by docents through out the facility. We would suggest you budget at least 3 hours here. There are various programs that are scheduled each day and you want to take these in. Most of the presentations of course involve the animals (manta rays, sharks, penguins, etc) but one of the more interesting ones involved the vet hospital and operations done on sick mammals, etc. The exhibits are well presented through out, the speakers are knowledgeable and the variety of sea life presented was good. There are no whales or orcas but that is just about all that is missing.",cmschw@comcast.net
50,Fantastic Educational place,"I could have stayed here another couple hours... I was with a group that kinda had limited time available and they all hurried through the exhibits. There is so much to see and do here I would say 3 hours is a minimum. They have informative shows, dive feeds in the big tanks, and more than one touch tank area. You can also feed necktor to lorikeets an just enjoy the beautiful surroundings. They also have a bat ray feeding if you get there early enough to sign up for it. Also think the behinds the scenes tours would be time well spent too. I'll have to visit again someday and stay longer! :)",TinyTuff
50,delightful!,"Very clean and well-kept Aquarium. Easy to manuever around a group or crowd in that areas were open, so there was no congestion even though we were there on a busy morning. Views were clearly marked and well-staged. Lovely facility.",HuskerFan010

40,"Oh, Those Penguins","The AAA book recommended one hour minimum, we had no trouble spending over three hours here. We took advantage of nearly all the demonstrations, watched videos, took photos. We especially enjoyed the sharks and loved watching the the penquins settle down on their sleeping mats. Most of the exhibits remind us of man's deleterious effect on oceans and their inhabitants; for us this was a bit too much after a while.",Devorah33851
40,Very nice aquarium!,The aquarium was a short drive from the Hollywood area and a fun day trip. We were able to secure a coupon that gave us a significant savings on our tickets. The aquarium was interactive and the employees were friendly. Loved the outdoor penguin area and the jellyfish collection. The gift shop was large and bright with a large selection of items.,pennepasta
50,Glad We Stopped,"didn't even plan this but it was close to the RV park we chose - there is so much to do and see there. Professional presentations on the order of Sea World but much more personable. Really enjoyed it, and it's close to Harbor Tours and Whale Watching Tours and many restaurants.",Sue A

50,Great Aquarium,This is a great aquarium in a beautiful spot. My family really enjoyed our day at the aquarium. There are some good exhibits highlighting different parts of the California coast and the varied sea life. Be sure to take a walk outside and see the lighthouse a water - a really beautiful spot for a walk or picnic.,ebusby

50,very nice day,"we had figured 2-3 hours for this attraction, but we ended up spending closer to 5 hours here. plenty to see and do. great outside area with 'touch' ponds. very interactive, both inside and out. inside displays were well lit and well signed. only thing we didn't like was the 'guide' who talked for two of our 'shows'. she really didn't know much, and was a poor speaker. she got one or two facts incorrect as well. otherwise, it was a great day!",loves2camp
50,Nautilus!,"Live nautilus at the ocean exploration along was worth the visit, not to mention the other exhibits such as the shark lagoon, watershed park, and the penguin and otter lake! Spacious and well-out, with an giant tank at the end of the entrance hall. Will definitely return.",Charlie
40,Loved the Lorikeets and Behind-The-Scenes Tour!,"My husband and I had time between our disembarkation from our cruise and our flight home so we decided to spend it at the aquarium. The aquarium is beautiful and has many different exhibits, both indoors and out. Our favorite was the Lorikeets! For just $3 you can purchase nectar for the lorikeets and boy do they love it! At times we had three birds on our arm at once :D. We decided to add the behind-the-scenes tour which we loved! The tour was an additional $ 14 pp (when purchased at the same time as general admission) and worth the cost! Our guide gave us a wonderful tour complete with a free manicure by cleaner shrimp! It was amazing to stand above the 350,000 gallon tank and feed the fish! A great way to see the aquarium and learn about the animals.",Janice M
50,Great for Kids and Adults,"I went out with a couple of friends and their 3-year old son for an afternoon, and absolutely loved the experience! The exhibits were huge, accessible, and beautifully presented. This is definitely an attraction that both adults and children will enjoy.",Michael L
40,SoCal Sea Life at it's best,An enjoyable afternoon exploring the various sea life in and around the southern California beaches. Reasonably priced tickets for all ages and tour plans.

Food is available along with a gift shop for all your needs,Bill L
50,Great experience for kids and adults,"High quality aquarium with great experiences for kids. The tank to gently touch rays and young Hammerhead sharks is very memorable for kids.

50,Extremely well done,"The sea dragon and jellyfish exhibits were huge, and so many sea horses! Penguins, sea lions, otters and tons of all kinds of sea life displayed in immaculate, sometimes interactive, but always educational settings. A great place for kids or anyone that loves animals and the diversity of life.",vetvet1234
50,Amazing even for Big Kids (adults),"My husband and I ventured here on a Sunday, taking the advice to arrive early. Parking was $8 across the street. We arrived about 9:30 and had a short wait for tix. We were able to navigate quite well this time of day. They offer several programs and all were nice and short which let us hop from one to another. We watched the sea otters, penguins & sea lion programs. I enjoyed being able to touch the rays, sharks and other sea life (like the sea cucumber). The sea dragons, sea turtle and sawtooth shark were some of my favorites. Several exhibits and programs including the touch areas for small sharks are outside so you may want sunscreen. If you exit, you can get a stamp to enter again. We did this and came back after lunch and decided we didn't need a second look as it was packed by then (2:45ish). They do offer a souvenir photo of you from your visit for purchase.",DaisyLu

40,"Interactive, fun and great for all ages","Our 6 year old son seemed to like the Long Beach Aquarium more than the Monterey Aquarium! I think it is because there are many more kid friendly interactive displays at Long Beach such as the Manta Rays, baby shark exhibits (where they can touch the fish!) and all of the water based activities outside too.",LetsPack!
50,Wonderful Place for All Ages,"I have been to the Aquarium of the Pacific twice and plan on visiting every time I get back to Southern California. The layout of the Aquarium is modern, and delightful. The tanks are gorgeous. There are a variety of activities for kids, but the adults enjoy them too. You can feed the lorikeets, pet a shark or a manta ray. As you wind through the exhibits there are volunteers with smaller exhibits where you can touch a starfish or a sea anemone. There are also other activities available for a combined price. I have taken the harbor tour and the whale watching boat. Both were fun. The exhibits and activities change with the seasons so there is always something new to see.",Manatee27

40,Just fun.,"I went with a group of friends all between 21 & 25. We thought it would be a lot of fun to go look around, and it was. However, it was crowded, and there were kids running around everywhere, screaming, making it difficult to hear the exhibits and enjoy ourselves.",travelfreak903
50,fish wonderland,"This place is great for children, I visit several times a year. They always have different attractions and great seasonal activities.",Jennifer F
50,Amazing Way to Spend the Day,My family and I had annual passes to this aquarium. It is very easy to get to and the parking is close to the venue. This aquarium is not huge but it is well done. Many great displays filled with a variety of different sea life. There is an outdoor touch tank that is great for the kids and a shark tank area. I would say that if you want a great way to spend the day you really should put this attraction on the short list of places to see in Los Angeles. Great for the kids and adults alike.,ceez1
50,Favorite aquarium,"I love this aquarium. When you arrive, there is a scale model of a blue whale suspended from the ceiling. The shear size of this animal is quite extraordinary. Breathtaking. My favorite attraction is the sea otters. They are so cute and comical. They entertained us for quite some time. Just love this place.",Lorri A
30,Not for the elderly,"It was my first visit to the Aquarium of the Pacific and my very young 93 year old mother was along in tow. The venue was very crowded with youngsters below the age of 12, which made it very difficult to accommodate space for my mom to get her wheelchair up to any of the enclosed view windows to see the fish. I don't recommend this park to anyone wishing to take elderly individuals.",destinieschild
50,Way good,"Brought my little brother here during his summer break. Only reason was because I felt bad because he wasn't really doing anything fun his whole summer, I was busy with school and work, so i took a day off from school and decided to bring him here so he'd enjoy the marine life and try to learn something new. Well the learning didn't really work because he was more excited in seeing the variety of tanks that were there, whilst I tried to read the descriptions/information he would look at the tank and be ""Ok, let's go the the next"".I just laughed at it and thought it was funny that he didn't want to ""learn"" during his summer break.Lot's of good things here though, I can't remember much from it because it was a while back that I came here(summer 2010). Highly recommend though",Flyguy05
50,Love this Aquarium!,"This place is amazing! It was actually an afternoon date and I'm so glad we went! The aquarium is in the downtown area close to the shops, restaurants and the preforming arts center. We got there and it wasn't crazy with lots of people or schools. The exhibits are so nicely done and I loved all the in-depth descriptions next to the tanks, and viewing stations. It's actually great for a date! The fish were beautiful,and it is a VERY clean facility.The staff was very friendly too. The layout is easy and had nice flow and the gift shop was ubercute! I can't wait to go back! Not just because its got special meaning to me, but its educational, well organized,clean, and parking was not a pain. Can't wait to return, such a great place!",Elizabeth P
40,Bigger and better than expected,"Took a chance on visiting this aquarium based on reviews and I was pleasantly surprised by how much my kids and I enjoyed this place. Compared to the Monterey Bay aquarium, Monterey has more tank displays and is much bigger in size. This aquarium though offers so much more for the kids to do, like the many open touching pools with baby hammerhead sharks, sting rays and even a small tank where you can touch jellyfish! There is also a bird sanctuary where you can purchase a cup of nectar and feed the parrots, who often sit on your hand while drinking out of the nectar cup. I liked the themed fish areas in this facility and there is a guide book for kids telling about the fish in each area of the aquarium. Once you have finished an area, you can stamp your guide book at an embossing station? My kids had a great time here. Be prepared to spend about 3-5 hours here, but it's well worth the trip and price.",sharka_boy
50,Somewhat small but Very pleasant,This is not a really huge aquarium but I thought the size was perfect for me. My daughter and I walked through the entire aquarium and enjoyed every bit of it. The area where you can feed the birds was very funny and just a lot of fun and laughter. We really did have a blast!!! My favorite attraction was the penquins!!,M V
40,A fun outing for all ages,The Aquarium of the Pacific has something for everyone. I spent about 5 hours there of which 2 were spent in the facility and 3 were on their Dolphin watching cruise. The aquarium itself is well laid out by Pacific marine ecosystems. The collection is vast. On top of this there are regular presentations such as feeding the sharks and a seal/sea lion show.The dolphin cruise was awesome. We came across 6 different pods of dolphins. Make sure you dress warmly for this as you go out to see almost as far as Catalina Island. It gets windy and cold out past the sea wall. The boat is big and comfortable.,Geoffrey B
40,Sea life beneath the waves,We took some overseas visitors there during the summer and found it difficult to drag them away as closing time caught up with us at the end of the afternoon. A wonderful collection of seascapes well presented and a great educational tool.,Taran H
40,Long Beach Aquarium,Always a million kids there on field trips who are usually badly behaved. Parking is outrageous and admission fee is ridiculous. The rating is based on the aquarium itself.,FGard
10,Pass on this one,"Very sad to report this, I am a big supporter of ANY aquarium to teach conservation. This place is the worst. Parking fees are outrageous, like 1.40 every 15 minutes. Half of the tanks are empty, and sadly the staff walks around like they are high and mighty because they volunteer. To top it off, the schools bring THOUSANDS of kids there, no supervision, and they run around screaming. When I was a student in the 60s and 70s the teacher took care of rude children and this did not happen. AVOID!!!!!!",paul b
50,Aquarium of the Pacific is a great place to go in LB and I enjoy taking family and friends when they visit.,"The first time I went to Aquarium of the Pacific I was kind of disappointed, but I think thats because I had just recently been to a much larger aquarium. I also didn't have very good company that day:-) But on my visit a few years later, I thoroughly enjoyed myself and had a really great time! There is a really great tank near the entrance with some really awesome fish, including the black sea bass and the sunfish (just about the weirdest-looking fish ever). I think I could stand gazing into that tank for an hour, it is beautiful. I highly recommend this aquarium to anyone visiting Long Beach. I do feel the prices are a little steep, but its a great place and a lot of fun so I will still go again.",hollym506
40,Great family venue - lots of interesting things 4 kids,"Very interesting and educational venue for young and old. Crowded on weekends & pricey, but, worth it.",RoyboyIII
20,More of a museum than an aquarium,"There are mostly exhibits and few live animals. I've been to aquariums all around this country, and this one was a great big disappointment.Not worth the price of admission.",Stuart L
50,feed the fishes,we were lucky enough to get a behind the scenes tour and feed the fish. excellent displays and easy to get around. Great place for out of towners.,georgia b
40,A great place,"This marks the second time I have visited the Aquarium of the Pacific and unlike last time, I left a bit dissapointed. My disdain had absolutely nothing to do with the great exhibits, outdoor Lorakeet enclosure and the stunning life that lives within. My issue was with the extremely large amount (literally hundreds) of children visiting from several schools on the day we went, guess we picked the wrong day. While this was mildly disturbing, I must say the school kids were pretty well behaved. Unfortunately, one mother that brought several of her own, or others, kids were ruining it for everyone. They ran about screaming and hollering, pushing others out of the way, photo-bombing whomever they could and generally making it miserable for everyone, including the school kids, We took as much as we could and unfortunately could not stand it any longer and so we left because of this one reason.My suggestion to the staff would be if you are expecting so many kids, close the place to the public for the few hours they are going to be there.Also...a little policing of the exhibits would be nice, then unruly people like the ones that literally followed us everywhere and ruined our experience can be swiftly dealt with.Otherwise, make sure you go and see this attraction, we bought combo tickets for the Queen Mary as well. There is a free shuttle back and forth that picks up and drops off right outside the door. Parking was $8 I think and there is a massive structure to park in. Easily accessed and signs pointing the way are everywhere.Don't miss it!!",David M
40,Under The Sea,"Been wanting to visit this attraction since moving to L.A., but distance to Long Beach & limited hours (9-5) have proven challenging. We joined as a member because it was just slightly more than daily senior fee and we plan to go back again within the year. Family, couple and individual memberships available too.Facility is visitor-friendly, right on the water in Long Beach, with lots of nearby garage parking ($8 for the day if you validate). Get a map at admissions that lays out the three-storied main building, plus the new outside exhibits. There are location themes to the displays, from the Pacific to the Antarctic. Not just sea creatures, but several animals as well, like penguins, sea lions and tropical birds.There are several ""shows"" daily, with divers underwater in the big tanks talking about the different creatures, while they are being fed. Fun for the kids (and adults) with the ""please touch"" stations, where you can pet a sting ray or a shark or a sea slug. There is also a live TV connection to a live-in facility where divers are studying undersea volcanoes.We paid extra for the ""behind the scenes"" tour which literally took us into the employee/volunteer areas to see how they maintain all those tanks, feed the creatures, and talk with the cadre of volunteer divers. A bit expensive for what you get, but interesting.My wife and I are both SCUBA divers, so we probably appreciated the Aquarium of the Pacific more than most, but this attraction is better than most aquariums (we've been to several), and well worth your time. Food, Drinks, Snacks, Gift Shop all on premise, plus several nice restaurants within walking distance with views of the water.Rich Allan is the author of ""Drafted,"" a comic/adventure novel.",Rich A
50,Family Fun!,great selection of marine life...plus touch and feel stations! The food was good too! Don't forget to shop at the store before leaving.,ADelabellaA
50,Love this place,"This is a really nice aquarium, and they do a good job with special exhibitions, events, and education. It's not the largest you will ever see, but size doesn't always matter! It's the kind of place you can visit often and enjoy it every time.",Ken M
50,So Much to See and Do,"I love penguins, so that was a huge draw for me, but there's so much more to this aquarium. There's a lorikeet aviary (which was closed when I visited, but normally would allow you to walk through.) I bought my tickets in advance and coupled with a ticket to tour the Queen Mary. There's a free downtown shuttle between the two attractions. I spend a couple of hours seeing everything at the aquarium.",sactokaren
40,Fun with fish,"We enjoyed the aquarium for the second time and took many photos with the fish. This is a smaller aquarium similar to Salt Lake and Seattle aquariums. The shows were fun and we cheered with the school children (we are in our 50's). There is an excellent restaurant on the 2nd floor, also.",timeoffagain
50,Truly spectacular even for a jaded adult,"I cannot imagine how much fun did I had at this place two weekends ago. Despite having just two hours before dinner, we rushed through all the exhibitions. Boy! I was very impressed.The aquarium has all its tanks filled with colorful displays unlike the overrated New England Aquarium(absolutely dirty and packed) and the Monterey Aquarium(most tanks empty and dark). The outdoor exhibits involving the sea lions, penguins, stingrays, sharks and starfishes are truly varied.The animal moved around eagerly.The staff was very encouraging, even adults couldn't resist touching some of the exhibits.So much fun!",Kyle92131
40,Cool Visit!,"Is not the first time we go to the Aquarium of the Pacific, and it will not be the last one. My four year old LOVES IT, is a really good place for toddlers and older kids also. We had a lot of fun petting the manta rays and got splashed by one of them it was surprising. The restrooms are clean and I'm glad they have a kid station and a place were I was able to breast feed my little one in privacy, that was awesome.Always look for coupons, I've never payed full admission price.",Gloria V
50,Awesome Aquarium,"On my 5th trip to the Long Beach area since 2009, I finally had the opportunity to visit the Aquarium of the Pacific. I wish I had visited it sooner. This is a very informative, educational and beautiful aquarium. There are many ""hands-on"" opportunities, engaging presentations, and unique displays. I didn't have the opportunity to eat at either cafeteria so I can't comment on the food or pricing. I enjoyed the gift shop which offered a variety of unique souvenirs. I found the price reasonable and parking in the structure across the street was easy. I was fortunate to visit on a weekday afternoon and the aquarium was not busy at all. That was very nice. I spent 2 1/2 hours at the aquarium and could have spent more time, but it was closing. I will definitely go back if I visit Long Beach again. I highly recommended this attraction.",GoingSomewhereAgain
50,Fun for all!,"I have been to many lovely aquariums, but this might be my favorite. I visited with my 8 year old grand daughter and we had a fantastic time. The displays are engaging and interesting for all ages. There are many opportunities for hands on experiences. The facility is laid out in way that is not overwhelming yet is spacious. We loved it!",Linda R
40,Nice aquarium and we go to all of them ....,"A good visit and we go to all the local aquariums when we travel. I find it oddly calming watching the fish swim by. As usual, it attracts all the kids and it was busy with families and school groups. We are two newly attained Seniors but we've been visiting aquariums worldwide for many years. Everyone will enjoy this well maintained undersea life place.",contheroad
50,Extraordinary aquarium experience!,"My husband and I are aquarium members. This is an exceptional aquarium focusing on the fish and creatures of the pacific oceans. We were amazed to see so many of the fish that we had seen while snorkeling the reefs around Maui and Lanai. The tanks are well cared for and beautiful. Weekends are crowded so it's better to plan a trip there on a weekday but a lot of schools take field trips there so just be aware. Most of the field trips are over by 2:00. The Scuba Café has some of the best clam chowder we've ever had along with a nice selection of other menu items for a quick lunch. We love the touch pools where we were able to actually touch sharks, rays, horseshoe crabs and anemones. The aquarium is educational and relaxing too! Plan to spend a day there and then go over to Shoreline Village for dinner. It's well worth it!!",luvnlife60_12
50,Got to pet Bat Ray and baby Tiger Shark,"Really enjoyed my visit, wasn't expecting much but it was so much more and the hands on was awesome...got to pet bat ray, baby shark, jelly fish and sea urchin, fantastic. Watched sea otters play, penguins swim and the coolest types of sea horses ever. Lots to see and interact with. Definitely worth the visit.",gwendolyn66
40,Great for kids,"The wife and I went here yesterday to check out the elephant in the room we were ignoring for the past two years. I love aquariums because I love watching fish. (that's not TMI, is it?)They have two levels of exhibits here but what astonished me was the really cool species of fish they had populating the place. The outdoor exhibits had fish and sharks you can touch while reaching into the water. You can touch some moon jellys and other neat things. This is a decent sized aquarium to spend approx 3 hours in.We didn't get to see any shows or presentations but they had several throughout the day.I enjoyed the penguin exhibit.I feel a lot of the enclosures were a bit small for some of the larger animals, but I assume many are rescue animals which I hope will be released back soon.A great experience to see some REALLY cool species",SonicSpringBok
40,Even fun when it's raining,We were living and needed somewhere to go. Luckily we decided to visit our local aquarium.Beautiful and very informative. Loved watching the animals in their habitats and would advise all parents to take their kids.,Cindy5221
50,Bring the Sea!,"My little girl, wife, and I visited in October 2013 and had a wonderful time due to the well laid out building, the many different exhibits, and the outstanding staff. Watching them feed the sea lions was a highlight as was the many environments inside. They didn't over do it with the environmental protectionism, but they did get the message across. Well done! We will be back!",Mark G
40,Loved it,"great facility, excellent exhibits, very informative...the hanging whale was the highlight for her. She loved the entire visit and she wants to see more.",JoJeJohn34
40,Good family outing,"I took my young son here and it was a good family outing. He wasn't really into the aquarium after about 10 minutes, but my wife and I also enjoyed the experience. Lots of interactive exibits and history. Many thing to see, and lots for kids to do. The location is busy but a really nice part of the city. The food onsite had many options but prepare to spend. More dining options are within a walking distance if preferred. This place is great for locals and tourists. We will be back.",Hellsumz
40,Good fun,"Loved the outdoor pools outside where kids (and brave adults) could touch the rays and baby sharks. We watched the seals and loved the penguins. There is also the Lorikeet forest where you can buy nectar and have them feed from your hands.There wear loads of interactive shows and divers would give talks from inside the exhibits.It's not huge and you can get round it quite quickly, but it's so interactive that parents and kids could probably spend a lot longer there,",BlueWoman
50,Fun Family Day!!!,"I visited the aquarium with my parents that were visiting from the east coast and we were all thoroughly impressed. I loved the hands on exhibits that allowed you to touch starfish, stingrays, sharks, and a variety of other sea creatures. I highly recommend for children and adults.I even signed up for an annual membership so i cant wait to go back.",katharding
40,More then just fish!,"Not huge... but perfect to see fairly new and modern aquarium displays. They also have a bird cage that you walk in like the Wild Animal Park in San Diego area. Think they are called Laurakeets. Cute, frendly, colorful birds that will eat right out of your hand.I have sold products to the Aquarium, and everyone I have dealt with has been very helpful and understanding so far. Not that that matters to most, but it does say a lot about the atmosphere being genuine. I liked it... my kids liked it, and even my Aunt and Mother loved it! Plus the area has been very fixed up the last few years now. Not very busy this time of year...if your not a crowd person Like I am not!... Sorry Disneyland! :-(",jeff R
50,a great couple of hours,Much nicer and more interesting than I expected. Well worth seeing. Educational and entertaining. I imagine young kids would really like this.,gbramson
40,Great party,We were here for a Holiday business party and combined this with a trip to the aquarium. Due to the late arrangement in the pm we were able to have the aquarium almost to ourselves and enjoyed the exhibits tremendously. I highly recommend it and will be back.,Ingrid651
50,A great feel good place,I took my family for an afternoon and it was a beautiful day. The otters were my favorite. We stayed there watching them for almost an hour. Really worth the money and I have been there a few times now. I will go back!,4minuu
50,Awesome museum,the main tank in the atrium is breathtaking. The walkway carries you through the various exhibits ending at the atrium. We had event there and had a great experience.,Rempt2
50,Best Aquarium on the west coast...,"We were able to walk here from our hotel. This is an amazing Aquarium, even on a Saturday when full of little kids. The Aquarium is exceptionally well-designed and curated. Every tank has a gorgeous exhibit within, mesmerizing. The focus is the Pacific in all its glory, and well-achieved. There is much to learn. We saw things we have not seen since a visit to Australia. This is a fun and educational place to visit, way above average, the aquatic life looked very well cared for...we highly recommend!",SallyCalifornia
50,Great for Teens,"A great place for the whole family to learn and interact with marine animals, focusing on marine life of over 12,500 species from the Pacific Ocean. Enjoyed the Fish feeding exhibitions. Go in the afternoon to avoid the crowds.",Steph K
50,Great Experience,"A well laid out aquarium. It seemed they went out of their way to make the exhibits approachable and to allow you to view them from different angles and heights. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. A solid family experience.",VenturaTraveler13
50,Totally awesome place to bring the kids,This is a very nice and well done aquarium. Very interesting exhibits. I especially like the large saltwater tank that is in the main hall area. They have a great outdoor exhibit for kids that has tidepool areas where they are encouraged to 'touch and feel the animals'. Very cool.,Andy B
40,Great for Families and grandma,We were on vacation and decided to visit the Aquarium of the Pacific. We traveled with our grandma and she's nearly 90 years old and the facilities were great for wheelchair access. My daughter loved the penguins and the otters. It made for a fun afternoon out before dinner.,Michael Yeh
50,Very interesting,"Amazing displays and some incredible creatures! The best ones were the deep sea creatures, and I really enjoyed the fish feeding. I loved seeing a Nautilus for the first time also.",nicklamport
50,Very interesting! Wonderful place to visit!,"I enjoyed my visit to this Aquarium. Here is a tip for folks who may want to avoid the crowds of kids - COME at about 2-3 p.m.! We came on a Thursday from 3-6 pm and there were only a few visitors. The school kids have gone home and you still have enough time to see everything. (You might not get all the lectures in though.) Most interesting are the Jellyfish displays and the Dragon-like/leafy sea horses from Australia! The otters, sharks and everything else are also interesting. It was not cheap to go in. So have avout 22 dollars for seniors and a little over 25 dollars for other adults. (Sorry I don't remember the prices for kids.) There were lots of hands-on displays and many workers to answer questions and give short lectures. The place is both stoller and wheelchair friendly. Very helpful and kind staff. We enjoyed putting watermarks on our guide books. Very fun and great for kids and adults alike! This is recommended for everyone.",HappyNorwegians
50,"If you like fish, this is a good one!","The Aquarium of the Pacific was a nice diversion during the relatively warm weekend that we were in Long Beach. There are multiple floors with different ""ecosystems"" on display with various indigenous species in each.Upon entry they'll take your picture to try and sell you on a picture package later. It's optional, so it doesn't hurt to pause for a pic whether you decide to buy or not.If you continue straight through towards the back, you'll reach a large, high tank that has large fish and sharks and there are different daily feeding times. They're fun to watch, but it can get crowded. It might be good to watch a feeding, then return in between so you can actually see.Upstairs and outside there are ""petting tanks"" where you can actually touch some small sharks, rays, and horseshoe crabs! Additionally, there's a larger shark tank, penguin area, and seal/sea lion display.Returning inside on the upper level, you'll see even more tanks.It was a good two hours and there's a slightly overpriced cafe upstairs as well. Since your donations do help maintain the Aquarium I didn't feel bad about spending a bit more than usual on the food/drinks.",BearAndTheCat
50,A must see--kids loved it!,"This is a beautiful aquarium with good parking and eating close by. The grand kids loved it! You can actually touch some of the more ""exotic"" marine life and see sharks up close and personal.",QuiltDiva03
30,Good for kids,Kids are allowed to touch some sea animals. Kids also get to learn about sealife. Walking through the aciary and feeding the lorikeets was fun for us and our kid.,Jeanina Santiago
50,Great learning experience,"There are many hands-on exhibits. You can touch rays and sharks! Also, they have an anemone table where you can touch these creatures as well. We did the behind-the-scenes tour and felt it was well worth it. Workers took time to explain everything they were doing. My daughter really wants to be a marine biologist and this helped to confirm her passion for sea life!",HammerJ R
50,Affordable Family Fun,We took our grandchildren with us and had a Wonderful day. They offer great prices for year round passes. We bought the Grand parents year round package. Very informative reading throughout the aquarium. Lots of employees and volunteers around to answer questions. Lots of hands on exhibits and touch tanks. We brought a lunch and sat outside and enjoyed the beautiful weather and scenery. We cant wait to Bring the whole family back.,gccamp
50,Extremely interactive and educational fun,"Upon entering the aquarium I was almost overwhelmed by just how much there was to see and do. We started off in the wonders of the deep exhibit where I was immediately oooing and ahhing over the nautiluses and deep sea critters. Then we reached the first interactive exhibit: You can pet moon jelly fish! I have a special fondness for jellies and rays, so this was a really special treat for me.The aquarium has a bunch more interactive exhibits where you can touch animals and speak with staff about the different animals in each exhibit. There are guides to each exhibit and they give you a program that provides even more interaction. The guidebook gives more information on the exhibits and animals and also serves as a free souvenir as you go around the aquarium and collect embossed stamps from each location.",Echolynn
40,"Great Aquarium, But Very Heavy Weekend Traffic","Visiting the aquarium on a sunday afternoon while visiting in Irvine, it's only about a 20 minute drive or so and lots of people said the aquarium was fantastic. Our daughter loves fish so we though this would be the perfect place.The place was a complete zoo, people everywhere, it made it very difficult to get to see in detail any of the attractions or exhibits. They did have a lot to see though, with additional movies and special attractions listed at particular times. Overall it was a very fun place to see. I would recommend it for sure however an afternoon trip in the middle of the week to allow better time to see the attractions/exhibits in detail.you can also purchase additional things with your tickets like harbor cruises and so forth which we did, the harbor cruise was about 45 minutes to an hour and was a great tour of the Long Beach Harbor.",AZTraveler94

50,Water Is My New Favorite Place,"Watching the dolphins and sea lions swim underwater with such grace in a beautiful environment makes me want to live in the water. This is a fab family outing or relaxing date night. It's not necessarily the biggest or the best aquarium we've seen, but it's quaint and friendly while still being up-to-date and environmentally friendly. The interactive elements are enjoyable for kids and adults alike.",EllieRKay
40,had an enjoyable time,"I went with my 7 year old twin girls, my 70+ mother on a weekday in August. This was my 2nd visit, but my kids and mom's first. The 1st time I went was when it was brand spanking new. I had a behind the scenes tour hosted by a friend who happened to be one of the sea life educators. Our peers called him ""the professor"" due to his expertise. Back then, it was much smaller with fewer attractions and I was single with no kids and a lot of free time. I recall that we went thru the whole aquarium in a couple hours and we were done. Fast forward to 2013 and wow, what a dramatic change. First, prices went up quite a bit, the facility has expanded and now has far more exhibits inside and out. I arrived close to noon and didn't leave until almost 6pm because there was so much to do and see.The whole facility is well kept and clean. I didn't feel it was crowded during the time we were there. We ALL especially enjoyed the hand's on experiences where you got to touch sea creatures. My kids wanted to read/see/do/experience everything they had at the aquarium and they certainly learned a lot. The staff is friendly & informative and happily answered any questions we all had. My kids read well and love learning about every subject. So I felt the money and time was well spent. Bring a light sweater if you plan on being there in the evening as the ocean breeze makes for quite a chill even in August. Before we went, I found a online discount that helped with the high price, but they also offer AAA and senior citizen discounts as well. We have visited the Seattle Aquarium, Maui Ocean Center and California Science Center in L.A., but this aquarium definitely beats out those any day! They had a few snack shacks onsite for any muchies you or your kids will inevitably have. After our visit, we ate dinner at one of the many nearby restaurants within 5-10 minutes walking distance and spent some time strolling and taking pictures around the beautiful areas outside the aquarium. If I lived nearby, I would get an annual membership so I could visit multiple times during the year. My kids and I live in Oregon, so it was great entire day of fun for us.",1twinsmom
50,Very Education & Visually Stimulating,"My family and I went here for my son's 11th birthday! I also have a 5 year old girl and an 8 year old boy. Each and everyone of us had a great time! I love how the marine life is categorized by the different regions of the ocean where you can locate them. What we really enjoyed were all the areas where everyone can have the opportunity to touch some of the marine life such as the jellyfish and the sharks. We also enjoyed the presentation of the scuba divers speaking to us from inside the tanks. The scuba divers even took pictures with the kids through the tank glass and gave the kids high-fives. My kids were so amazed and engaged during their entire visit, there was never a moment that they were ""bored""! They were so curious and had so many questions! Definitely worth what we paid!",iNa_MeAnA
50,"Aquarium @ Long Beach, CA",We went while they were still doing the night admission. It is from 5:30 pm - 8:30 pm for 1/2 the cost of regular admission. It is not packed so you can enjoy all the exhibits. They have a nice assortment of marine life. Make sure to see the sea horses and jelly fish. Everyone in your party will enjoy God's creations!,Michellee67
30,Interactive Aquarium in SO. CAL,"A great way to spend a few hours this aquarium has by far the most “touch” pools of any aquarium I have been. It has great exhibits that pertain to the pacific as well as other areas of the ocean, like the deep ocean that are not often displayed. There were of course the usual sea lion shows and diver shows as well that ran at very regular intervals. My favorite part was the moon jelly touch pool! Very cool.While I would recommend this to anyone visiting the area I would say that it is not the best aquarium that I have been to, however it is by far the most interactive. I also thought it was a bit pricey for what it was. If you can use an AAA discount, AARP, or other I would suggest looking into that before your visit. Overall I would say that this a great place to visit and a must see for ocean lovers and families or those who love aquariums.",Katie L
50,Great fun for the whole family!,"this is a nice aquairuim! we have even paid the extra and fed the sharks 3 times!!! pet the sting rays and birds, check out the animals- great fun time at a clean fun aquiruim!!! best one around!!",Tammy R

40,"Large, Diverse Aquarium","We like to visit aquariums everywhere we go, and this was one of the better ones. It is well-maintained and has a good variety of exhibits. The shark touch-tank was novel, at least for us, and there was a reasonable diversity of fish and mammals on display. It wasn't as locally-centered as I might have expected, and as a result it sometimes felt a bit generic. However, we enjoyed our visit. One problem, perhaps unique to the day we were there, is the number of small children, unruly small children at that. That isn't the aquarium's fault, unless they were running a special promotion that we weren't aware of.",Stuart G
40,nice,"great Aquarium good interactive activities and a good variety of things and areas to see, Very informative and helpful staff",tracyandsteve
40,Cute aquarium but way crowded!,"We went on Easter Sunday so we mistakenly thought it would be lighter crowds....not so and very hard to move around some of the exhibits. Nonetheless, a cute aquarium and my young children loved it....especially the aviary where you could hold a cup of liquid bird food and they would land right on you. What a great experience!",megasaurus
30,Good for kids,Kids will surely enjoy this place. Ambience is really good. Very affordable packages as well. Make sure to take their harbor tour its very enjoyable.,MsOracle
40,Pretty Darn Good,"A relatively new aquarium, but worth the admission, I was amazed by the different types of seahorses and jellyfish, and the diving show, for lack of a better name was very nice. There's a good outdoor part, too, with penguins. Nice for everyone, but probably really nice for families",DesertDuck
50,Lovely family outing,"Great for kids and adults. Fabulous exhibits, shows and ""petting zoos"" we were able to pet jelly fish, stingrays and sharks! big hit with my 7 year old.",Zoe A
40,Interesting,"It's not as big as I thought but still very interesting. There are lots of different and unique marine creatures. I especially liked the Japanese spider crab. It was HUGE! Kids would surely have a good time. Aside from going to the aquarium, you can also take a 45 minute harbour cruise or a 3 hour whale watching cruise. We took the harbour cruise and enjoyed it.",WinterWhite13
50,Amazing Behind the Scenes Tour,"My wife and I took the behind the scenes tour of the aquarium and it gave us a vantage point we never have seen of the many aquariums we previously visited. Maura was our guide and she did a great time of taking us where normal visitors never got to see. We saw incubation tanks and saw how divers entered the tanks and got to feed the fish as well. We then were able to walk through the aquarium as normal visitors and found an amazing, beautiful and a terrific representation of local fish and aquatic animals from around the world. Wonderful place for kids of all ages.",srobby
50,A must see for all ages,"An amazing aquarium, loved the penguins and watching the divers feeding their hugely varied selection of sea creatures. It is informative and colourful at the same time. The staff clearly love their work and the animals that they look after. Even the casual visitor gets a sense of the fun, enthusiasm, incredible professionalism and energy of the place. Great day out",Janette1993
10,Never ever been moved to write a review until now...,"This was the most poorly organized excursion I have ever seen! There was no indication that harbor breeze cruise is the same as the aquarium of the pacific cruises. I reserved the tickets online the night before and was directed to 'the kiosk' at the aquarium. The was absolutelyno label on the sad-looking kiosk and wasn't even displaying a screen. I only discovered I was in the right place after pushing the screen in desperation and it came to life. Not that getting the tickets did us any good. There was no signage at the harbor. We arrived an hour early and could easily have been the first in line.... IF there had been any way to know that a line would be forming at a particular location. It's now 9:20 we have not left and no one has spoken to us and we have not set sail. Terrible, terrible, terrible organization!",geneb16
50,Brilliant - especially loved the jelly fish!,Was really good with many displays of fish we had never even heard of - the jelly fish were great and there are some interactive displays where you can touch some of the different species. Very educational throughout and any 'shows' were educational and interesting to view. A good day out - you could spend a while if you wished but we didnt have much time so flew around in the morning. Very helpful and happy staff too :D,EmmalucyB
50,Many sea animals to see,We visited the aquarium in the early hours of operation. The exhibits were not crowded. Many docents to explain exhibits and there were audio/ and signage to provide more information. The touching pools were popular and the animals came up to the edge of the pool to be touched. The on-site vet has treatment rooms that are glass enclosed so it was interesting to see him working on animals. Bird enclosure was also cool. Very good way to enjoy a morning,Carolyn G
40,Good for kids and adults,"Great hands on/touch tank opportunities, and very nicely laid out with plenty to see and do. There are shows, feeding times for public participation, educational info etc.",Ladyfngers
50,Stunning Displays of Marine Life,"After a Port of Long Beach tour, we visited the Aquarium in Long Beach. BTW, the POLB offers free 1 1/2 hour harbor tours four times a month but act quickly because the seats are limited and they go fast. See www.polb.com for details. I was astonished at the variety and quality of marine life at the aquarium, both inside and out. We spent about 5 hours there but could easily have stayed all day. There are all kinds of interactive things for kids to do, from the touch tanks to feeding the lorikeets. What really stood out for me were the exhibits in which divers were in the tank with the fish and sting rays. In one exhibit, the diver talked to the kids in the audience with the large sea bass and zebra sharks swimming around him. They were spellbound. Me too. The Aquarium exceeded my expectations.",winsomelosesum
30,Better aquariums are around,We have been to both the Atlanta and Baltimore aquariums and they are far superior to this one. It seemed I'm teractice for yoyng children but not for anyone else. We took our 1 year old son because the fish entertain him. Not worth the price when you have seen better already.,del3315
30,Good time to spend the evening,"I took my 3 yr old son this evening to the aquarium and he had a nice time. My wife suggested to use the Late night discounted ticket (after 5 pm) for $15 and it was a wise decision. We covered the entire aquarium within 2 hrs and spent time outside. I had a lot of expectations for this aquarium, however I am bit disappointed that AOP doesnt have dolphins or Whales. There is a shark lagoon and my son had the opportunity to touch the baby ones. The merchandise were decently priced. Not worth a second trip though..Overall, it was an OK evening..",sgmkjsekar
50,The interactive aquarium,"Not only beautiful displays and information on the creatures that live in the sea, you can also touch big manta rays, sharks and other fish in this aquarium. Not to be missed ! If you have the time, there a 3 whale watching trips a day and the round trip time is around 3 hours. You get a discounted aquarium and whale watch cruise ticket as well",kapurkk
50,Ocean Creatures!,There was plenty of ocean critters too keep you interested. It was a little on the expensive side but interesting. It would be great if you had kids.,trustme58
40,Great way if you have a couple of hours when visiting Long Beach,It's a great aquarium and the highlights are my favorite watching the Otters! Also wonderful jellyfish displays and petting area.,Mary Helen C
50,Excellent aquarium! Best attraction in Long Beach,"This aquarium is maybe even one of the most enjoyable attractions in the LA area. We've been to the Monterey, CA aquarium several times, touted as one of the best in the world. It's great, but surprisingly the Long Beach aquarium was just as good! So many species of sea life, so many expansive areas to explore, many things to let kids actually pet (small sharks, bat rays, starfish, etc.) I've never seen so many unique and colorful creatures, even in books. The reviews were mixed but we ended up being given a coupon. With what we know now we would've went even if we had to pay full price.",lovelyjamilew
50,We loved this place!,"Great hands-on, interactive experience. There is a lot to see without it being overwhelming. The touch tanks were impressive. My kids had so much fun petting different sharks. The staff brought them closer when my daughter had trouble reaching different ones. Petting the rays was fun too. They were splashing out of the water and fiesty. We saw several shows. The sea otters doing tricks for food were great. The sea lions (and their trainers) were impressive too. It was fun watching penguins darting around in their area. There are discounts available. I think we got a percentage off through AAA.",DLOWENT
50,Great Experience!,"It is a very nice aquarium, well tended,very good exhibits and it has species I hadn't seen in other aquariums, Good explanions by keepers and volunteers too. We bought the ticket that included the Harbour Tour , 45 minutes, and it was worth because we saw some sea lions and pelicans in the harbour.",ariana60
40,Nice collection,"Great exhibits, lots of variety and pretty fish. The outdoor area and touch tanks are nice. There are animal talks/shows all day. The cafe was excellent! Skip the movies though-- the free one and paid 4D one were low-budget and terrible.",nita999
40,Got to touch a shark ...and it was shark week,"I got to touch a Shark . I wandered this place with my 16 and 20 yr old in tow .We all loved this place .The displays are wonderfully presented .You get up close and personal with Penguins ,Otters and Sharks .The ""touch tanks "" are impressive .Sharks and rays fluttering about .You get to touch the creatures under the watchful eye of aquarium staff . It truely is educational and entertaining .The admission fee is $ 25 ( included with GO LA card ) .Highly recommended .",tomchuck19
30,Nothing spectacular!,The aquarium is just alright & doesn't worth paying $25/adult. It's good for kids but not my 14-year-old. I would rather spend the time on the beach.,Melanie Y
40,Sea Otters and more,Wonderful place to take the family or just go on your own. Love the sea otters and the jelly fish. Great place to bike down too.,MHJC55
50,Family entertainment braided together with education. ...,We spent the entire day at the aquarium. There are several petting and touching stations including jellyfish!!!! I have been to many aquariums and zoos and never has there been this much hands on for all ages. It is not as big as Shed Aquarium or the one in Atlanta but it is worth the visit. The tanks are clean. There are lots of educators teaching about the exhibits. I would recommend looking on line for coupons...,hutchens74
50,Nothing like the Aquarium!!!,"We have been to many an aquarium & love them all, but when Long Beach proposed an aquarium (which is where we live), we were so thrilled. The City of Long Beach have done a fabulous job at improving & expanding the exhibits for all to enjoy. A definite must for children to see & us older kids as well. The location alone is worth the trip as the Long Beach waterfront is a visual & dining experience for all.",Bebe44
50,Great place for all the family,"I visited with my 18 month old son who loved the hands on aspect of this Aquarium, and the fact that he could press his face against the glass to see the marine life beyond. Staff were very friendly and helpful, especially when my little on cut his head on a sign (which needs to be made a little safer I think). Our favourite bit was stroking the tiny sharks and the staff member on duty noticed that my son could not quite reach, so lifted a shark up to his level (imagine the excitement!). A fabulous day out.",BilboKMB
30,Nice Aquarium in SoCal,I think the activity my kids liked best was the paper imprinting stations placed around the aquarium. The imprints could be made on the paper program that was provided upon entrance. The outdoor exhibits such as the shark tank and the lorikeet cage were intriguing.,anchi123
30,Aquatic afternoon,"I enjoyed my afternoon at the aquarium, but if I'd paid the full $25 entry fee I think I would have felt ripped off. (Conventioneers get $8 admission with a flyer and their badge.) The exhibits were awesome - especially the hands-on ones: jellyfish, manta rays, sharks, and anemones. The otters were fun to watch, and tanks like the nautilus were unexpectedly neat to see.The huge tank at the end of the main building was closed for maintenance - and was so cloudy you couldn't hardly see anything.Many others who came with me commented on other aquariums (Baltimore and Atlanta especially) being far better than this one, but for an afternoon - especially with discounted tickets, it was a lovely diversion. I'm sure my 3-year-old son would have loved it.",Sarah G
50,One of the Best Attractions in Long Beach,"Whether you are looking for family fun, are interested in marine biology or love incredible visual beauty, there is something interesting for any age or walk of life. The Long Beach Aquarium is so much more than a fish tank! The exhibits are fresh and interesting; there are sea mammals such as seals and otters, a petting tank, a closer-than-I-ever-wanted-to-be shark viewing station and a wonderful walk-through aviary.The best part is that while you are having fun and being entertained, you are learning so much abut the sea and it's crucial importance to each of us.Allow most of the day to see the Aquarium of the Pacific, you will get your money's worth! (Free shuttle busses will get you there from the downtown hotels and other parts of Long Beach.)",FlowerPower68
40,Well done and educating,Nice acquaria and a surprise: petting sharks! never done that before. We spend a nice 3 hours inside. Come early to avoid the crowd.,Toemaarjongens
50,great family fun,"this is a great place to take your family with kids of all ages. Easy to get around, plenty to see and lots of interaction",Toni M
40,Fun Time,"Inexpensive, fun time. Have gone two times now, always alot of kids, but week day was much less. Neither time have we stayed very long, but saw what we wanted to atleast.",Christina S
50,Even the Locals Enjoy a Day at the Aquarium!,"As a local of Long Beach I had the pleasure of watching our entire waterside area and downtown area go through a revitalization - the cornerstone of this revival is the Aquarium of the Pacific. I hope that anyone that is planning to visit the Los Angeles and Long Beach area makes the effort to visit our Aquarium.Not only will you get one of the best examples of Pacific Ocean life you can enjoy our Lorikeet Forest, a 3,200-square-foot outdoor aviary, the Shark Lagoon which features more than 150 sharks, some of which you can touch! This expansive indoor and outdoor Aquarium which is celebrating it's 15th anniversary this year is a great afternoon or day for any and all visitors!As locals we are lucky to have this excellent Aquarium to visit on a regular basis - I hope that if you are a local and have never made a visit to the Aquarium of the Pacific that you do, and that if you plan on visiting the area you make the time to include the Aquarium in your plans. You'll be glad you came!",JeffreyLB
40,"Really Nice Aquarium~Not Sea World, Chicago or Monterrey Bay but Nice!","This aquarium focuses on Pacific fish, so plan on that being the majority of what you see. They do have a small South Pacific section. Their main tank is nearly three stories tall. Nice hands-on exhibits for kids, so this aquarium is tailored to fit their needs. It did have some huge sea horses and some nice rescued specimens of mammals. Their sea otter section is about half of Monterrey Bay's. If I had to pick between Monterrey Bay and this one it is Monterrey Bay or Sea World in San Diego. It is a nice diversion and having been here last summer, it was still worth going again. They do get new stuff and change their displays. If you get to Las Vegas, check out Mandalay Bay's Aquarium which is really nice too! I liked their display a little better than this one.",airebornranger
50,Great place for young and old,"If you live anywhere near an ocean, or wish you did, you should visit the Aquarium of the Pacific. We live in Long Beach and visit at least annually. The current star attraction is the Magellanic Penguins, but the seals and sea lions and otters are always entertaining as well. The windows to many of the exhibits are lower than usual, making viewing for children and anyone in a wheelchair much more accessible. Children also get to touch lots of sea creatures. The educational programs are terrific and the aquarium is doing a great service by educating visitors on the importance of protecting the oceans.",siddog
40,Kid friendly and fun,"I'll start by saying I am a bit spoiled by the Monterrey Bay Aquarium, which is hands down the best I have ever been to, so keep that in mind as you read this review.Aquarium of the Pacific is an excellent family activity for those visiting downtown Long Beach. Conveniently located for cruise-goers, the aquarium is easily accessed with plenty of parking. As with many port attractions, there is an interesting mix of beautiful Harbor and industrial views from the front of the building. There are often musical performers outside on weekends.The aquarium is fairly large and densly packed with marine life. There are plenty of up close and personal encounters to be had with sharks, fish, anemones, and other animals. There is also a somewhat out of place, but delightful, bird exhibit that allows guests to feed and touch the animals.My only criticism of the aquarium is the layout. Exhibits branch off the main hall, leading guests to concentrate in certain areas. This makes the aquarium a bit more difficult to navigate with large groups or families.Overall, there are more impressive aquariums out there, but the Aquarium of the Pacific is well worth a visit, particularly with small children.",John A
50,The Aquarium of the Pacific is first class!,"I am a charter member of the Aquarium, and am thrilled with how the aquarium has continued to improve over time. The exhibits are first rate with absolutely gorgeous fish from various regions of the Pacific ocean. The sea dragons are not to be missed! I go to the aquarium at least once a year, and always enjoy the sea otters.I like how the area around the aquarium has developed into a restaurant row with a variety of restaurants like PF Changs and my personal favorite, Gladstones. This is a beautiful setting by the water with a terrific view of the Queen Mary.",COOKIE8A
40,Avoid crowds,"I've been here several times. I could sit and watch the sea otters groom themselves all day long! During the summer and winter vacation it is best to arrive as soon as the Aquarium opens at 9:00 to avoid crowds and difficulty parking. During the school year it is best to arrive at 2:00 p.m. as the groups of touring school kids thins out. In the summer see the outdoor exhibits first while it's cooler then go to the inside halls where it's air conditioned.Don't eat the food here. It's expensive and not that great. The Aquarium can be thoroughly seen in three hours so get a hand stamp at the door and have lunch at one of the restaurants within walking distance (I like P.F. Changs). Or bring your own picnic and eat on the benches near the grass area out front. Then you can always re-enter to see the gift shop, one of their 10 minute educational movies or presentations (they call them shows) that you missed in the morning. The Tropical Pacific Dive is a good one. There are no dolphins or whales here. For those go to Seaworld!",love4pugs
50,GREAT SIGHTS AT AQUARIUM OF THE PACIFIC,This Aquarium is one of the best exhibits of of Pacific Ocean Sea life. The impressive 3 story tall lobby with a life size replica of a Blue Whale swimming above you gives you just a glimps of the sights you will see there. Then walk towards the towering 3 story high glass aquarium will with a school of yellow fin tuna swimming around! It's all a well presented and impressive Sea Life exhibit worth seeing here in Long Beach.,LBMikey
50,Absolutely beautiful!,"It is a wonderful experience. The fish are beautiful! It is fun trying to find the snakes! Being able to read about each fish, reptile ,and mammal makes it very interesting. My mother loved feeding the birds.",Southdow
50,A fun night!,"A special night open to seniors (older people in body not minds). It had been a while since I visited! the displays were incredible! I tried to take pix but didn't turn out. The colors were amazing, the information insightful. The docens were around to answer any questions, petting area was incredable!",Susie Y
40,Long Beach Aquarium,Very nice but there are usually about one million kids there which ruins the serenity of the place. It is visited by Long Beach Unified School district students for field trips so almost always has a crowd of unruly kids. Also....WAY too expensive!,FGard
30,"Nice, but a bit dated","Went to a private event, so that was cool. Food was catered and just ok for the most part. I have been to the GA Aquarium and you can't compare these 2 places. AOTP just seems a bit dated in comparison. But if you are in Long Beach and want to get inside, a few hours would not be wasted.",Jon K
50,Great place for the family.,"We have season passes and always have a great time. It is a fun place for all ages. Plus it is small enough so the kids can have fun and not get lost, but big enough no one gets bored. Plus for the bigger kids they have an activity where the kids can get a stamp at each exhibit.",jennifergradis
50,Pet the sharks,"Fun, Educational, Terrific way to spend the day. Go early in the morning during the summer... It gets very busy in the afternoon. Walk over to the Queen Mary in the afternoon. Bring good walking shoes.",Rennata Levy L
50,Great way to spend half day in long beach - kids or adults!,AOP is a great way to learn about the oceans of the world and everything in them. New exhibits all the time!,NikiTennant
40,Great place for all ages,"The Aquarium of the Pacific is a very nice, intimate venue. It may not be as expansive as the Monterrey aquarium, but it's exhibits are nicely organized and well presented providing an opportunity to view and interact with the animals. As with most exhibits of this type, crowds can be an issue. But if you arrive before their opening time (10:00) ready to enter when the doors open, you'll be able to enjoy the majority of the exhibits before the bus loads of people arrive. My favorites are the lorikeets, the shark petting tank, the octopus (when he honors us with his presence!), and the jellies. The staff is always very helpful, knowledgeable and engaging.",ratboy1
40,Great for the whole family,"The day that we went coincided with multiple summer camp trips. While the exhibits are very kid friendly it was so crowded and noisy with the kids that it was not an ideal day to visit. However, the exhibits and the lectures were fantastic -- many I had never seen in other aquariums. The shark (some you can touch) and jelly fish and dragon seahorse displays are not to be missed. Also there are extensive displays of gorgeous corals. Will definitely return when school is in session.",Baltimore48
50,You never get tired of this attraction,"This Aquarium is well designed, and has beautiful exhibits. They have large reproductions of general habitats (like kelp forests or Northern Pacific Tidal areas) and more concentrated exhibits of individual animals. The jellyfish and the coral displays are so otherworldly and beautiful, they may bring tears to your eyes, or at least a smile to your face. They also have presentations going on everywhere in the Aquarium, so there are always lots of things to do. We saw a delightful demonstration of sea otter care, feeding and training. But every time we go we see some new things. This time it was weedy sea dragons. I can't even describe them to you, but wow. Who knew? And there's always something we miss, so that as we're leaving, having had fun 'til we dropped, we end up saying--""So, next time the giant spider crabs and the lorikeets, right?"" That's really the perfect attraction.",Susan S
40,Great day out,"We were travellers from the UK and really enjoyed the aquarium . Great value with plenty to see and do, you even get to touch several fish and even small sharks. Food options are a bit limited. Overall we really enjoyed the day. A multi-story car park opposite , so easy to park. $8 day. Well worth a visit.",Stephen V
40,Great museum kid friendly,This site has enough to keep both kids and adults informed and entertained. Great stop on the trip. Staff at museum very friendly and accomodating.,Julie C
50,Aquarium of the Pacific,We went to the Aquarium of the Pacific and loved it! They have touch tanks and informative stations all throughout. They also have a booklet to stamp with different stations which made it like a treasure hunt! The price was normal for what you saw. I would recommend this to anyone in the area. You can then go to the Lighthouse nearby. They have other restaurants in the area to see and other sites to see.,Karen D
40,Really neat,"It was really neat to touch sharks and rays. The jellyfish were really neat too. A little pricey, but worth it. The Lorakeets were really neat and the staff was very nice.",BrananMike
40,Great Exhibits!,"My family and I visit the Aquarium of the Pacific each time we are in Southern California. It's a great attraction for all ages with wonderful exhibits. The aquarium is clean and well-maintained and volunteers are all around to offer information regarding the marine life on display. The gift shop also contains a variety of unusual and beautiful marine-related items.We typically visit the Aquarium of the Pacific and then spend some time at The Pike and Lighthouse Point, where you have a great view of the Queen Mary.",Knani
40,Morning at Long Beach Aquarium,"Spent an enjoyable morning at the Long Beach Aquarium. A great place to check out if you are planning on snorkeling on Catalina Island. There is an exhibit that has the flora and fauna that you will encounter, and interesting information pertinent to the kelp forest that you will encounter.",FrederickBurg
50,Nice aquarium,"We purchase tickets for after 5 pm visit at a discounted price of $15 but I would suggest visiting in the morning as soon as they open. The aquarium is pretty big, there is lot to see. It gets very busy. The exibitions are great and the aquarium location is nice, you can plan to spend all day in the area, you won't get bored.",ninamelie07
50,Visit with grandson,"We had never been to the aquarium so we had no expectations. It was just awesome. All of the staff were so helpful and loved talking to our 6 year old grandson and helping us to find the things that he especially wanted to see. You can pet jelly fish, sharks, sting rays, star fish and do so many fun things. This is an absolute must and we will return again soon.",Paula M
50,Beautiful Aquarium,"Lovely setting on the bay and a beautiful building with a huge whale hanging from the ceiling. Divers were in a few of the tanks feeding fish. Beautiful fish, weird fish, hands on displays. Lots and lots of kids groups visiting all having a great time. We've visited many aquariums and I put this near the top.",Sue60133
50,A Wonderful Visit....,"If you are in Long Beach, the aquarium is a nice place to visit. It's beautiful with lots of wonderful sea life to observe and a nice touch tank for the kids. It's up to you on how long you would like to spend there with the shows but it's an attraction that would take about half a day if you do everything. Definitely visit.....it's a beautiful.",igotidea
50,Lots of fun plus even better at half price!,"We went to the aquarium on a half off discount that can be purchased online, if you go after 3pm. Our little 3 year old loved it!!!!. He enjoyed seeing a large octopus. We were shocked to see it so large & so well lite up so you could really see every detail. There were lots of hand on activities including touching sea anemones, jelly fish, manta rays, lokeet birds, & starfish. My son loved seeing the seals & sharks. He especially enjoyed seeing the latest addition, the penguins. They even had an area you could pretend to be standing in Antarctica with them. There was lots to see that in our short 3hours we thought we should have got the family membership so we could return a few times to see more. At half price it was great because my 3 year old was not overwhelmed with hours at the aquarium but just interested enough to ask lots of questions & want to return! Plus we were able to explore downtown Long Beach, the shops, the queen Mary earlier in the day and still see the aquarium!",Fffly
40,Family fun,"A great place for the family! This place kept 2kids (7 and 9) and 2 adults engaged from beginning to end. I think it was about 3 hours that we toured. There were 4 touch tank experiences and they are awesome! We were there during the week so the crowd was not huge. Be sure to look on their website for discount options. We got 10% off for AAA. It was worth the price of admission. Shopping/restaurant options within walking distance,too.",Tamara L
50,Leafy sea dragons are amazing,"First off, it isn't cheap to go to. But you get what you pay for. Plenty of parking. Amazing attractions. Loved the otter exhibit- they are obviously happy & have lots of enrichment items. Leafy sea dragons (a rare find at aquariums) were so cool. Hungry/thirsty? A well run food court offers up all kinds of food & beverages. Enjoy!",TravelPrincess69

50,Excellent aquarium,"I am a member of this aquarium and that in Monterey Bay. I love them both, and feel that the Aquarium of the Pacific gives me an experience nearly equal to that in Monterey. The touch tanks are superior, and the displays are very well done. The whole is set up to be easy for families, and provides excellent educational materials. There is a small playground outside to shake out the sillies, and lots of adjacent parkland for picnics and boat watching.",BarbZoo
50,Worth it,"At first I thought this place was kinda pricy, but after going through it decided it was well worth it. Staff is knowledgeable and friendly. Very educational no matter what your age.",Lisal2013
40,Fun and good to spend time,"I visited the aquarium with a local friend and we had a lot of fun. There are many exhibits and weird sea creatures. The place has beautiful views and many petting pools.The only thing missing was one of those aquarium shows with sea lions, or whales.I would totally recommend anyone to visit it. It's worth the time and money.",Sid_LAS_84
50,So much to see & do for the whole family!,"Went with kids & grandkids. Want to go again. Wonderful displays. Lots of activities for the little ones, much of it outdoors. And the setting is perfect. Beautiful area, near a marina, a park, a lighthouse, great restaurants & shopping. The day we went it was extremely crowded, but I can see why.",daljulie
50,A Place of Wonder,"This exceptional aquarium is a great place to visit for any age, toddlers to adults. The exhibithalls represent different areas of the Pacific, with beautifully designed tanks. which have plenty of room for the creatures to swim about. There is a kelp forest, tropical reef with over a thousand species of fish, an abyssal fish area (something one usually never sees. Outdoors there is a shark lagoon displaying many species of sharks. And there are penguins, and harbor seals.At regular intervals the entrance room darkens with screens depicting various films of sea life, and , perhaps, best of all towards the closing tome, the sea, with fish swimming is projected upon the entire floors, creating the illusion of walking on the water and looking down into the sea. Whether one is interested in moray eels, jellyfish, shorebirds sea otters or huge 0r tiny creatures, this is the place to see them. I can't wait to visit it again.I also enjoyed the excellent gift shop with unusual plush toys as octopi and sea otters. among others.More than any other aquarium that I have visited, this one really is informative, as well as beautiful.",Connecticutosprey
40,Lots of new stuff!,We visit the aquarium pretty much every time we're in the area. There were a number of new things to see this time.,hollimar
40,Small but good.,"This is a nice spot to visit. I have been there in the morning when a lot of children were also present. The Aquarium is not as big as I thought but it is a pretty nice place to visit. The smaller size (compared e.g. to the one in Chicago) makes it perfect with Kids. There are a lot places where children are even allowed to touch fish. In addition the visit can be combined with a harbor trip and a visit of the area around the aquarium. For those traveling by car: if you keep your aquarium ticket, the fee for parking will be $8 no matter how long you stay.",Steffen B
40,Good time,It was a nice aquarium and offered a lot of different species you don't typically see. Having ability to interact with and touch animals is always a big hit with kids. We did combo package with Blue Whale cruise. Didn't see an whales but were able to see a lot of dolphins which was cool.Didn't get chance to see everything as we arrived late and ran out of time before cruise departed. What we did get a chance to see was cool and had a good time overall!,simbadusty
50,Great with the Grandkids,"This is a very easy spot to visit. We had our grandkids and they loved it. Many very large viewing windows for larger species and several pools for touching, etc. Food was average, but again, did not go there to eat.",mitch w
50,Really Nice,They really did a great job with the space they have here. I was really impressed with how clean the place was and how they had different places to visit inside and out,travelshooter71
40,Loved this!,"We've been to many aquariums over the years, and this was one of the best. We loved the fact that is is indoors and outdoors, and they have lots of interactive exhibits for kids (and adults!) Would definitely visit again!",Runwaychic
50,Lots to See & Do,"My family and I planned on visiting for half a day and ended up spending all day at the aquarium. Between the shows and the interactive exhibits - feeding lorikeets and petting sharks - there was so much to occupy our time. Feeding the lorikeets was so much fun, although it did get a little messy! The penguins were so cute...even stopping at the glass to ""pose"" for photos. The movie in the main atrium was nice to sit and watch after a long day of walking.",k2win
40,Educational and fun,"I love aquariums, and we don't have kids. This one is a bit on the smaller side, but they make up for it with all the attractions. There's both an indoor and outdoor area with lots of interactive displays. There are guides everywhere to teach about the animals and exhibits and answer questions. I was really impressed with the guides and the information.The biggest downside is going when there are groups there. It seemed very busy when we went (although I don't have another day to compare it to). The lines for the indoor touch tanks were very long and slow moving, but I love the idea of having them. The deep sea area seemed very cramped, but I'm not sure if that was due to the dimmed lighting or the crowds or just the way the displays there are set up.A must-see spot if you're in the Long Beach area.",MzHartz42
50,world class,"I love to go to Aquariums, and this one, though not very old, has worked very hard to reach world class status. It has amazing displays and I love it.",spanprof1
50,World class. Enuf said.,"Truly a world class aquarium that's great for kids and adults alike. Maybe it's funny to say for a ""fish place"" but one of my favorite things is visiting the Lorikeet. I buy the nectar to feed them and they fly over and land on your arms, your hands, your shoulders and they're such beautiful birds.",TrinaSchoon
50,Fab!,My daughter wants to be a Marine Biologist and she loved the sights. The birds and their colors were fantastic.,lovethesights
50,Your kids will love it,"There is too much to see and do to list everything, so to sum it up; your kids will not want to leave. Bring water and a change of clothes for the kids, there are places they can get soaked. It is very educational especially if you catch the divers giving commentary in the tanks.Take your time to read all of the information posted around the entire facility, it is worth it.",Robert B
50,Great variety of sea exhibits and a strong focus on ecology,"This is a great aquarium that offers a variety of ecosystems on display. The staff is very helpful and knowledgeable, they answer any question you have and help you enjoy the experience more. The ""hands on"" area is awesome, really mesmerizing watching the animals so close.I'm from San Diego and think that this aquarium challenges our Birch Aquarium as far as displays but offers some things (like the penguins!) without the hustle-bustle of Sea World.Long Beach really has a ton to offer for a quick get-away in southern California!",beachfeetSoCal
50,sight seeing,this is a great aquarium fantastic if you have kids loads for them to do lots of exhibits to look at enjoyed the visit.,cowan s
40,pet the sharks,"nice aquarium to take the children too you get to pet many diverse animals small sharks, jelly fish, sea stars, manta rays. jamba juice and snacks located inside. A little on the expensive side i expected there to be way more exhibits for the price of admission.",luis d
40,It's a cute little aquarium,Kids will love the place. The nice thing about this aquarium is the location. You can go for a walk long the beach and dine in many restaurants around there. It's a small but excellent aquarium.,PoySak
40,Great Aquarium and Location,"The Aquarium of the Pacific is conveniently located near the downtown waterfront area of Long Beach. For its size, it features some great exhibits and is very informative. Staff members are usually eager to answer questions.I agree with the other reviews here: You'll enjoy the Aquarium most when the large buses/tours - kids or adults - are not here in bulk. Kids especially get excited to see the beautiful marine life and critters, but you'll enjoy your visit here more if you plan ahead.Bottom Line: The Aquarium of the Pacific is surely worth a visit and is more enjoyable if you plan ahead.",DiveMoreWorkLess
40,Very nice aquarium!,"Great aquarium - large indoor section, pleasant outdoor sections with seals, penguins and parakeets. Would definitely recommend.",frankc6
50,Great Place for Family,"When I was little, my parents would take me here a lot with my younger brother and older siblings. I am a camp counselor; and last July, the camp decided to take the kids there for a field trip. I was overjoyed to see everything again. I must say that the arctic fox exhibit isn't as exciting as they make it to be; but the shark touching, the sea lions, the stingrays, and the bioluminescent creatures are sights to be seen!Fun trick with the sea lions: Bunch up a sweater and push it up against the glass to get the sea lions' attention. They'll get excited and start to chase it.",Denise C
40,nice addition to the city,"educationally and visually appealing; great addition to long beach for a day trip, staycation, out of town guests, family day, something to reward the kids with.",peninsula4
50,Time your visit,"The website tells you to go after 2pm to avoid school groups. Take this advice! it's a much nicer visit without hundreds of kids. If you go later in the day, you can still catch most if not all the shows (which are really short - which is great - about 10 min each) and you miss the crowds. The penguin exhibit is fun - they put on their own show. :)You can get a AAA discount for admission.",barbara h
50,Great Family Attraction,"I have been a supporter of the Aquarium of the Pacific since 2008 and I love this attraction!! Member prices are paid off in 2 visits and you get to know that you are helping to support a wonderful aquarium that loves to help and care for its animals. Not only are the sea exhibits amazing (be absolutely sure to check out the otters and leafy sea dragons - besides the big ones like the sea lions and seals), but there is also an amazing lorikeet exhibit, so be sure to bring a few dollars extra for the special sugar water you can purchase! Go see this aquarium, it is worth your time and your money! =)",shellzep
40,pricey but worth the trip,"we bought the package including the queen mary which i also recommend. skip it if you see school buses outside!! we went on a friday in the morning which we thought was a safe bet, however there were 100's of kids on a school field trip which took away from the exhibits a bit cause of all the screaming and running that kids of course like to do! my favourite was the sealife they let you touch.",kalikea83
50,Good Value Entertainment,Many things to see at this wonderful venue. There are numerous tanks to view both from above and below the water line. You can touch several fish in shallow pools. There are several live shows to see. I was surprised to find displays for birds and a Lorikeet feeding cage at an aquarium but it was fun. The fish are fantastic but the jelly fish and sea horse displays were outstanding. Parking is right across the street for $8.00. The admission price seemed like a pretty good bargain with a nice discount for seniors. They have a huge gift shop and we found the prices to be reasonable. It is a great place to spend at least two to three hours.,manglin
50,Very well done,"Loved this place for cleanliness, displays, and for having an outside area that allowed us to enjoy the weather, and exhibits. There were plenty of employees/volunteers around to teach and assist with live demonstrations. My kids really enjoyed feeding the Lorikeets in the enclosure. Excellent experience with huge tanks and plenty for kids of all ages.",AZ-Traveler85253
20,Overly priced for what are they showing,"The aquarium is small with not so much to see, i consider it expensive to what they offer, we saw a few sharks, seals, fish, penguins and jelly fish.And few birds to see, and that's it.Maybe it's more suitable for small children than to teenageres and adults.",HD76HD76
40,Very Nice Aquarium,"IT is a very nice aquarium; well maintained; all the species of marine life are pretty much the same compared to several other aquariums around the U.S - Shedd in Chicago, Chattanooga, etcThe best part of this aquarium is that there are whale watching tours that depart from the marina, which is an absolutely amazing trip to see fin whales, gray whales and if you are lucky some orcas!!!!",cbrdarsh
50,"Fun, Beautiful & Educational","What a great place to spend the day with the whole family. There are so many neat exhibits -- especially the Sea Otters and the Penguins! -- and everyone there was so nice and helpful. We had a great time and look forward to going back soon. Oh, and don't miss the Seals & Sea Lions show too. In fact, my advise is to get there early and plan your day around the Show Schedule -- they are all fun!",CJ_Reilly
40,Great Aquarium,Favorite place to go when the grandkids come to town. Well thought out exhibits. Could stand in front of the tropical fish for hours.,GlendaleGirl1
50,The Best Aquarium,"This has to be the best aquarium. I love the displays and interactivity of the Aquarium. Getting to touch the sharks, sea stars and sting rays is always exciting. The Aquarium is so clean and the staff and volunteers are so friendly it is amazing. We always enjoy visiting with or without our grand daughters.",BigBill45
30,Cool for events,I have been to both a corporate party here and also a wedding. Very cool concept and nice to be able to check out the sea life without many people around. Super helpful if you are having a wedding where kids are invited. My nephew had a great time checking everything out while photos were being taken and people were grabbing drinks at the bar.,NicoleJS
40,Love visiting the Aquarium of the Pacific!,"The Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach opened to the public in 1998, and my wife and I have been visiting ever since! When you walk in, you are greeted by a huge hanging replica of the Blue Whale (the biggest animal on Earth). One of our favourite exhibits is the Northern Pacific Gallery! it features a playful pair of California Sea Otters with a new baby otter, some massive and creepy Giant Japanese Spider Crabs, and a Giant Pacific Octopus, which are just a few of the cool creatures on exhibit. The Aquarium also has special seasonal exhibits and during one of our visits, they actually had several Nautilus on display in specially pressurized tanks. It was a treat to have gotten the chance to look at these ""living fossils""!Also, there are several educational programs including one which had an American Porcupine on show, as well as touch tanks where one can look 'n feel at various types of seashore life such as anemones, bat rays and round rays. This place is always fun to visit! Over the past several years, quite a few good restaurants have been built up along the boardwalk outside the Aquarium. The parking garage is close, right next to the Aquarium as a matter of fact. You can visit additional stores on the boardwalk, or even take a water taxi across the other side to the Queen Mary ship and the Scorpion submarine. I just wish that the Aquarium would expand as it's the best location possible.Boat tours around the harbour and beyond are available daily, so there's quite a lot to visit while in the area. To top it off, AAA members can get discounted entrance tickets to the Aquarium.Enjoy!",Djinnii
50,Great Afternoon,"The place was full of a ton of cool aquarium exhibits! Also, it was big enough to make it feel like your saw a lot of stuff and not too big that you'll be dead tired afterwards. Overall really nice and fun.",Mike H
50,Family-oriented Education with Pleasure,"The Aquarium of the Pacific was a wonderfully instructive experience for our party of a 5 and a 9- year old with two grandparents. There were many ""volunteens"" and other docents to explain away the many exhibits. Different aspects of the sea were put together in common groupings and in beautiful exhibits. As in many most good aquariums, there were opportunities to touch and sense the animals that were being seen. The sealion and seal exhibit could be viewed from above and below and there was an underwater walkway between the two sections of the tank. Our party found the diving birds exhibit the most entertaining with our arrival at 3:30 coinciding with an unscheduled feeding. Great fun to see how the diving birds swim. The penguins were nesting and weren't as obvious as they were in their dens. Apparently they will come out in later May and June. All in all, a wonderfully entertaining and informative visit. Cost is a bit high, but considering the scope of wildlife support, it was worth it.",John H
40,Perhaps a little pricey with parking on top,"As divers we were wondering how much we would enjoy this aquarium but it is really very well done with lots of things to see, do and touch. Not a cheap day out but well worth the $45 entry fee",Ben O
50,Family fun!,Perfect for my two-year-old nephew and my 70-ish parents. And I got to touch sharks and a ray! Coupons available (pick up tickets at Ralphs) for discounted entry.,jdubstl
50,Best aquarium we've known,"This is another ""must visit"" each time our grandkids come. We have visited other aquariums from Chicago to Seattle -- and believe this to be the best. We must thank the LB Convention Center mgr. for getting us started. Now some of our family members have annual memberships.",joseph b
30,Not very impressed,"I would think going to see an Aquarium on the Pacific Ocean, we could see some whales and dolphins but not here you won't. Try Chicago if that makes any sense, or San Antonio even. The tanks were very cool to look at with all the different areas of the Pacific Ocean represented. I thought the exhibits at Moody Gardens were more impressive personally. I thought the penguin exhibit didn't tell you much about penguins or even have that many penguins. There was a lorikeet area where you could feed the birds tiny cups of nectar for $3, not sure what that has to do with an aquarium but ok. The touch pools were nice, you could pet rays and sharks. We watched a 5 min movie about how our SUV's are destroying the planet, that was a waste of time. The gift shop was nice. This would not be on my top list of attractions for the area.",ljmzta
40,Fun for the kids,"The touch pools were really great for the kids, and for me as well. :) I loved the sharks and jelly fish. They fed the fish in the tanks while we were there and the kids liked to see the scuba diver in with the fish. It was a fun place to visit, but be sure to find coupons before you go because there are plenty out there and it is kind of expensive without them.",PurpleLady123
50,Aquarium and Bird Exhibit Cute.,"The Aquarium is nice, not huge by world standards, but has a unique touch, with interaction with sea life and birds close up.The Bird sanctuary was a big hit with all, and you can feed them as they land right on you for food treats.",Ritchie H
50,Beautiful and educational,"The staff clearly love working with their animals, and with children. They have many different types of exhibits and interactive activities for adults and children. The aquarium is also affiliated with local boating tours, which really adds to the experience for the day.My kids appreciated the approachable staff who made even the shy children comfortable with animals and asking questions.This wasn't our first visit, and I hope it wasn't our last!",kitonjones
30,"Great display, but you won't learn much","Many of the tanks here rival those in other world-class aquariums. The large shark exhibit, and kelp forrest are notable. Unfortunately you will not learn much about the exhibits, sometimes stuggling to identify what you are looking at. The aquarium is located in a great area to walk around once you are done (which could be as soon as 2-3 hours).",cfc113
50,Amazing Aquarium,"2nd time traveling to LA and been to the aquarium both times. A top notch aquarium, such a wide variety of sea life with many interactive exhibits as well. The touch pool where you can ""feel"" the sharks and some other sea life is amazing as well. A must visit if in the LA area.",Edward Y
40,Nice indoor and outdoor exhibits,"Nice exhibits, good for younger kids. We bought the package for both the Aquarium and The Queen Mary, which was a good value.",Loreen U
50,"Great variety, beautifully displayed","The variety of sea life and the well thought out displays were most interesting. Some of the areas had speakers guiding you through what there was to be seen. Some of the areas allowed touching the smaller sharks, rays, anemones, and starfish. There were also interactive digital displays. Children as well as adults will find it both entertaining and educational. If one person buys a membership, pricing for accompanying seniors is halved.",PrH66
40,Educational time that the kids enjoyed,"Went the aquarium with a 6 year old and a 4 year old, they both loved it. Nice clean venue with beautiful exhibits with volunteers available to answer any questions. You are given a map when you enter (there are extras around the aquarium if you need more), in this there are stamps that you can find through out the aquarium that the can impress in the map.A nice family trip, garage parking available. If you get a parking ticket for the garage and eat at Bubba Gump next to the parking deck, they can validate for parking.",Serangel4263
50,Very nice after 5PM,"We saved 50% on the price of tickets to visit the aquarium after 5PM. With day light savings, walking out back to see the shark tank and listen to the excellent live jazz band was a pleasure. Don't expect to see any shows though, other than the 4D film, which is a separate purchase by the way. Didn't see the film, can't comment on it. Otherwise, a beautiful facility, and many more exhibits than I expected to see.",Al M
40,Wonderful place to spend several hours,"Aquarium of the Pacific is not the largest or coolest aquarium that you will ever visit. It is well laid out, with several exhibitions on the second level including the penguins and sea lions. The staff spends alot of time with the exhibitions, and watching the interactive exhibits is what makes this place special. Divers in the large tanks feed the fish and sharks, and discuss the creatures of the sea as they go about their business. The shark exhibit outside pales in comparison to others, but there are petting areas to feel the surfaces of many ""safer"" water dwellers. I give this place a big thumbs up for all the work by the staff, and recommend spending 2-3 hours here next time you are in Long Beach. Parking is plentiful and across the street with easy access. Lots of dining choices within walking distance as well.",Otodoc
50,Enjoyable and Interesting,Wonderful displays attracting adults and children alike. The back of the house tours are very interesting.,JSW842
50,Something for everybone.,We enjoy this place and go often. They're continually adding new exhibits. Great variety. Kid-friendly. Kudos for their emphasis on saving the oceans as well as their inhabitants. Everything is here from big sharks to exquisite little seahorses that look like twigs until they move.One suggestion: Don't assume weekdays are less crowded; this is a popular destination for field trips for elementary schools. Check ahead with the staff if you are flexible about best time to visit.,AuntMaggieHenderson
50,Awesome,"Initially bought a one day admission, thinking -- ""How often could I possibly come to look at fish?"" then, after about 30 minutes inside this fantastic other world, I went back and bought an annual pass. If you are within driving distance of Long Beach - DO NOT miss this attraction. Educational and entertaining.",RIVERMAN63
40,Aquarium visit,"Very nice place, lots of cool stuff...look for the sharks! It is in a very busy area, lots of population, lots of traffic...it IS a neat place to visit...just be aware of the large amount of visitors. The food services are ok, but very busy, and really not too special. The exhibits are special, however. Note....Bubba Gumps restaurant is really close...it is a neat place to go...but also very busy.",DantheMountainMan
40,not only for families and children,"We visited the aquarium on a day, when the weather was not so nice. it' s nice located, near by the queen mary. The best is the sharkpool and you can touch little sharks.It took us 2 hours to see everything. I can not recommend the restaurant inside. But you can find outside the aquarium various restaurants.",Jackie S
50,No bait and switch here!,"We purchased a combo pass to go whale watching and to the aquarium. We'd never been to Long Beach and thought the aquarium would be a good time killer while we waited to go whale watching with our sons (2 1/2 and 6, one of whom is a whale lover).Long story short, the aquarium was a bigger hit than the whale watching. It's well done and a very nice size - not too small and not too big. Also, when we were there it wasn't overly crowded - very comfortable.All that said, we struggled to spend more than an hour at the aquarium. My kids are adventurous and my 6-year-old was enthralled by the interactive whale exhibits, but everyone was done when we left after about 75 minutes.We followed it up with a bout of unexciting whale watching (in the kids' eyes - since all we saw were dolphins and a spray of water that may have been a whale). After getting back to land, the kids wanted to go back to the aquarium...and then each morning for the rest of our trip, the 6-year-old asked if we could go back to the aquarium.All in all, well worth it. I'd suggest visiting in the AM, strolling along the harbor (it's a very nice area), grabbing some lunch, and then going back for a second look at anything you found interesting in the afternoon.",justalittlecrazykc
50,A Little Fishy,"I had a little trouble finding it hte first time, I confused it with stadium or something with fish on the walls, but it was great when I finally found the real Aquarium. You sort of work your way up and around until you reach exhibits on the roof. Jelly Fish are always my favorite. As I watch them slowly drifting around the tank, my stress melts.",Kenneth L
50,very fishy,"Well laid out,never felt crowded.Pools where you can touch baby sharks and full grown rays. Lots of facts and figures available for those who want them. Walk through area of small parrots but be careful not to stand behind them! Eating area with plenty of seating and not too much crab/lobster or fish on the menu,why would you want to eat the exhibits?!",juneP51
50,Great aquarium,"We visited it with our 6 year old and it was way better than we expected. The exhibits were very good with a wide variety of species, my son loved the touch tanks. There were very interesting talks with divers in the tanks. We loved it.",Dlopardo
50,Wonderful place,I visited recently with a 6 year old and we both loved it. He enjoyed petting the sting ray and star fish and we both loved seeing all of the jellies.There were so many different things to see and so much information. There was volunteer staff through out offering fun facts and tips.I also loved that there were healthy snack options.If I lived in the area I would be a member but since I do not I will just have to be a frequent visitor when I am in the area.,KathyO843

50,Wonderful Aquarium and our Kids love this place!,"We have membership passes to this aquarium and visit it often.The kids never tire from revisiting this place since they love all the different activities they offer. Some of those activities are: petting sharks, petting bat rays, feeding the Lorikeets, touching jellyfish, and of course touching different kinds of creatures/plants in their man made intertidal pool. There is so much to see and do and it can easily take up a large portion of your day. Love this place!",Julie R
20,Very Rude to Disablled Guests,"I have been to all of the other major aquariums on the Pacific coast from Vancouver, B.C. down to Acapulco, Mexico.My travelling companion was in a wheel chair. We have been made to feel very welcome at all of the other Aquarium facilities onthe Pacific Coast - not so at the Long Beach Aquarium.I could not believe how rude several of the staff were to us. My Aunt has a medical condition which prevents her from speaking above a normal voice tone. The staff were unwilling to walk a few steps over to her chair so they could hear her speak - several of the staff just pretended she was not there.This facility is also incredibly expensive for the experience they offer.Based on how we were treated, I do not recommend this attraction.",Kelly B
40,Bring the Kids,Wonderful aquatic exhibit in Long Beach. Need to spend a few hours before getting on a cruise ship? Take a stroll through the aquarium. Visit included lots of school kids visiting the exhibits so just be prepared for people. Good displays and wonderful animal talks by trainers and staff.,Cpaw19ski
50,Highlight of our trip,Great stop on our trip of CA.Not sure who enjoyed it more....us or the kids....lolGreat to do as a package with the Queen Mary as offered on the site...very close with free shuttle in between and can easily do both in 1 day.,Sherri2424
50,Educationaly and Fun,"I actually got in free with a fellow teacher on teacher's day....the exhibits were fun, educational and easy for adults or kids to follow. The whale show on the ceiling was wonderful and the variety of fish, animals, sea environments and tank displays were all engaging. The entire venue can be viewed in a good half day. Outside the Aquarium you are right on the ocean in Long Beach with many eating/drinking establishments within walking distance as well as other attractions and coastal views.",pb7711111111111111
50,AWESOMENESS,"this place was very cool! everything you expect out of a aquarium and more! you learn a lot, and i love the animals1",Sara S
40,"Get ready to learn, not see an animal show.","You can't go in expecting Sea World. This is a small aquarium with an emphasis on learning. The aquariums and exhibits they have set up are there for teaching, not thrills.One of the best exhibits is the Blue Cavern. It is a replica of a dive spot on Santa Catalina Island, and regularly has a diver, equiped with a hydrophone, to speak about the various marine life inside the exhibit. In this 30 foot tall exhibit you will see leopard sharks, moray eels, yellowfin tuna, and giant groupers.The Tropical Pacific exhibit is the largest, and has many, many species as well as a beautiful zebra shark. This exhibit also has show times with divers who speak about the environment. This exhibit also has a tubeway where guest walk through making for great pictures, especially if the Olive Ridley Turtle isn't being shy.The Northern Pacific exhibit is where you'll find sea otters, which every time I've gone, are always playful. Here too, there is a speaker who gives information about the otters at various times throughout the day.The Baja California exhibit is one of the smaller galleries, but you will see many smaller displays which eventually lead you to the tubeway where you will see the sea lions, which then leads you outside to the outdoor exhibits.There is an outdoor sea lion viewing area, a penguin viewing area which has a unique underwater box that is great for the kids to crawl into. There is also a bat ray touch pool and touch pools at Shark Lagoon where you can touch bamboo sharks and stingrays. Shark Lagoon also has a large shark pool that has a Fresh Water Sawfish, Sand Tiger Sharks, Black Tip Reef Sharks, Zebra Sharks, and Sand Bar Sharks. This attraction has above water, and lower level viewing.Also outside is a Lorikeet Aviary that lets guests buy some nectar and feed the friendly birds. A great attraction for the kids as long as they're not fraidy-cats. Also outdoors is a small ampitheater for Children's Programs, a small playground for kids, and an Animal Rescue exhibit.They have an outdoor snack shack and an indoor cafe. I've never eaten there, since the Aquarium is located in The Pike section of Long Beach, and has plenty of quality restaurants nearby within walking distance. Also withing walking distance is Rainbow Harbor and it's beautiful park with a lighthouse and great views of The Queen Mary.For those who live nearby, a seasonal pass is well worth the investment. It only cost me $115 with no blackout days and is good for myself, my wife, and my daughter for that one price.Weekends, as you might imagine, are very busy since this a very affordable attraction, so go early. Parking cost $8, and as mentioned before, there is plenty to do withing walking distance, so make a day of it. The Aquarium itself, if you spend the time to see everything, will be about a four hour visit, so plan on having lunch or dinner in the area. There are whale watching and harbor cruises nearby as well.MY BEST RECOMMENDATION is to take a BEHIND THE SCENES TOUR. This tour was so good that I've done it twice. They show you all of the workings of the Aquarium, let you see the breeding areas, class rooms, feeding areas, and in the finale, they take you above the Tropical Pacific exhibit, (which I called ""The James Bond Room"" since it looks like something out of an 007 movie), and let you feed the fish. We got in there just before divers went into the water to do one of their shows and they were so friendly and enthusiastic, and believe it or not, unpaid volunteers!This place really isn't stroller friendly, especially when crowded, so we don't take ours anymore. There are no lockers, so bring a backpack.",Tim S
40,Too many people!,This is an amazing attraction to see sealife of all kinds. The down side were all the people. If a person could go on a week day it might be better as with so many people it was difficult to see some of the exhibits. Overall they did a good job in showing the habitats and history of the sea life in the Pacific. The peguins were amazing and my grandson got to pet a shark! It was worth the drive from San Diego and different from Sea World.,Rave007
50,Fun Day!,"Went here because we unfortunatly found out there was a ""black out day"" in the middle of our 3 day trip to visit ""the Mouse"".It was a VERY pleasant, enjoyable and educational day about 1/2 hour from Disneyland. I would do again.",Desertrose56
50,Amazing aquarium,"Stopped here on impulse with two teenagers. While not expecting too much in terms of entertainment, was pleasantly surprised at this museum. The exhibits were beautiful, and very appealing. They have an incredible array of tropical life, and don't miss the giant, as in 3 foot, sea crab exhibit! Everyone loved watching the sea lions and seals, and of course ,who can NOT not pet the sharks! The only negative was the 4-D theatre production--it was of fairly low quality and ""quirky"". The rest is fabulous.",KittyGirl34
40,"Some very interesting stuff, worth a visit","We spent out last afternoon after visiting Disneyland here, and it was worth it. So much interesting stuff and one of the nicest touches was that there were a couple staff members who appeared to do nothing but walk around the exhibits chatting about what was shown, and doing a very knowledgeable job of it. I wish other places did that.",GregWebs
50,So good and so close,"There are many famous aquariums and I've been to most of them. I had no clue how good this would be. What a pleasant surprise. This place is fabulous. World class displays, very friendly and knowledgable docents/volunteers. None of the snooty "" we are the world's best"" attitude. It is well organized and manageable.We went with my wife and 4 year old grand daughter. She LOVED it and after 2 1/2 hours was finally tired out.We enjoyed the place so much, we joined. This is going to be a regular attraction for my family.",ianbeavis
50,Amazing Aquarium visit and whale watching tour,"I visited with my kids ( 16 and 12) and we had a great time. We purchased the combo tix- aquarium entry and boat tour. We parked across the street in the garage for $8 with our aquarium stub. The exhibits are amazing. Lots of different animals to see and many chances to actually touch sharks, rays, starfish, shrimp, anemones, etc... Great information from staff really helped us to know a lot about the whales we were hoping to see on our boat tour. Even my big kids loved collecting the embossed stamps throughout the aquarium which fit into the free guide. This aquarium is bigger than Scripps in La Jolla, and took us about 3.5 hours to tour. We ate lunch outside the aquarium( lots of choices along the very beautiful long beach dock.....walkable even with small kids.) We then got on the 3pm boat tour and saw dolphins, a sunfish, and seven Fin Whales. The naturalist on board the boat from the aquarium personally greeted everyone and answered any question we had. It was a super fun day and an experience my kids and I really enjoyed.",BeckiW
30,Great for Kids & Families - Adults Only - Maybe Not So Much.,"I visited the Aquarium of the Pacific on a Thursday, arriving around 11:00 am, leaving around 1:30pm. It was fairly crowded but I had no trouble finding a parking space in the adjacent parking garage. The admission line was short.Inside the Aquarium, I found the exhibits to be OK. Nothing spectacular in my opinion. There were a bizillion kids everywhere and they however, seemed to love it. We were able to see everything fairly quickly, so we didn't really feel like it was a great value for the admission price.I was there with my husband and as an adult attraction, we were not that impressed. If you come with children, it will probably be a big hit with them. There are several interactive games and wildlife encounters available.Check their website before you go for on-line specials and discounts.",DeAnna W
40,Worth a trip to Long Beach by itself!,"I have been to the aquarium a couple of times and it is always a good visit. The indoor exhibits are nicely arranged and quite diverse. The outdoor exhibits are an added bonus. The shark tank has some wonderful specimen and the chance to touch sea life is always popular, not only with the children. I would suggest saving the money for feeding the birds unless you are there on a day when there are not a lot of visitors. If it is crowded, the birds will be full and will stay away. If you are skeptical about the cause of global warming being man's activity on the planet, you may find some of the displays a little over the top.",Techkraut
50,Great representation of the Pacific Ocean!,"I had some time to kill before my flight so I decided to visit this aquarium. Not up to the Atlanta or National Aquarium in Baltimore, but a very nice smaller venue. A nice variety animals including penguins, puffins, seals and otters. A little pricey but a good way to spend a few hours.",Donbethesda
40,could be bigger,this place is small!!!so why the great rating? because of the sealife on displaythey had loads!!!at first when we walked in we was like IS THAT IT???its only when we was inside the building thatwe realised thats where all the sealife is keptmanaged to pick up a shrimp !!!,babyangel2007
50,Great aquarium! lots to see and do,"Incredible variety of exhibits with everything from polar regions to the tropics. The sea lions and sea otters were my favorites. They also had some really cool weedy sea dragons, puffins, penguins, rays, sharks, sea horses a sea turtle and more. The staff and volunteers were friendly and engaging.",Jeremy044
50,Had a great time with the kids!,"There are so many things to see at the Aquarium. Prepare to spend a lot of time there as if you were planning a trip to the zoo. Not only is it very educational but very fun for everyone! To me the most interesting sea creature were the seahorses that looked like there were leaves attached to them. I forgot the name of it but it was so cool! You can also touch manta rays, small sharks, and horseshoe crabs. My kids will never forget the experience there!",azpinoyinmesa
40,"Excellent if you have children, but still good if you don't!","Lots of things to see and do and even touch (if you want) Plenty of activities for children (which we don't have), but even my husband enjoyed getting the embossed stamps in the guide! Having been to quite a few aquaria in the past, this ranks quite highly - there are all the 'usual suspects' in tanks, but there were a few things I'd never seen before, and they are definitely working on increasing populations of endangered seahorses & the like. The sea otters are a joy to watch and have been 'trained', but mostly in order to ensure their wellbeing. They seemed to take great care in keeping everything clean too - the sight of a diver in one of the smaller tanks carefully cleaning up the rocks was quite suprising! It all explains why the entrance fee is fairly steep - definitely worth getting the combined ticket for this plus the zoo if you plan to do both. At the time we visited, there was quite a lot of construction work under way - it should make it even better once everything is completed.",GremAndTabs
40,Loved it,Picked this place after hearing it was one of the largest. I planned it for my daughters birthday. We drove from San Diego and we loved it. It was not that crowded. But I was expecting to feed the seals. It was fun and the store does not have high prices. So if your in a budget it's ok to purchase. I will defiantly go back and get the VIP package,Henry M
40,Worth it,My husband and I decided to go to the aquarium as it was recommended by a friend in the area. It was $52 for 2 adults. It was totally worth it. There was actually alot more there then we thought there would be. We seen a lot of fish we have not seen before. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We loved the birds outside. Location was great to. Parking near by is $8 so not bad and there are lots of restaurants right there as well. Located along the water so we took a nice stroll after we left. We recommend it if you have the time and extra $ in your vacation budget.,vacationsalot
50,fantastic place and great for the family or as a solo walk.,We enjoyed the stingrays that swam around in a great pool and the touch display where very gently you could reach into the water and experience interaction with soft sea creatures and snails. The jellyfish were neat to view and the displays explaining the southern pacific ocean and all its vast and unique ecology is educationally rewarding in itself. There is quire a lot to view and enjoy and we rushed through in the final hour they were open. Would recommend a visit to this aquarium if in long beach area.,tanyasm
40,"It ain't Sea World, but it'll do!","I visited the Aquarium back in November 2006, and I was quite impressed with the variety of sea life they had on display, considering the relatively small amount of physical space they had (compared with Sea World). The shark exhibit is particularly impressive, and the staff are knowledgeable and personable.",TrojanSkyCop1
50,The kids love it!,With having a 3 year old it was an easy choice to join and purchase an annual membership. Everytime we come it's always exciting and like the first time for our son. The location is great right on the harbor and near shoreline village. The staff is wonderful and helpful. I think I have as much fun as he does!,jeff M
50,Nice Aquarium,"We're annual members. It's a great place to take a 6 year old who enjoys looking at fish. We've had some fun here, and it's a very nice aquarium, well worth an afternoon if you have one to spare.",BobTheMighty
50,Great Fun for an Afternoon,"Aquariums are always fascinating and this one is no exception - Friendly staff, clean premises and an easily accessible location.There are many exhibits inside and out with all sorts of sea life in various size tanksSmall indoor tanks provide up-close viewing of the colorful tropical fish, seahorses, nettles, jelly fish and various other small creatures.There are quite a few touch pools for that hands on experience with bats rays, shovelnose guitarfish, starfish, coral etc.Sharks, sea lions, otters, penguins, shoreline birds, diving birds are all in larger tanks - amazing to watch and we were able to view the penguins during feeding time which was a lot of fun.Don't miss out on the Lorikeet Forest. They sell small cups of nectar for you to take in and the birds will land all over you and drink the nectar out of your hand. The birds are gentle and small children can feed them as well. The record for number of birds on a person is 16. I had three.Overall - a relaxing educational experience and one you can do over again.",Off2SeeItAll
40,"Cool place, nice way to spend a few hours","Aquariums are always fun. There's sharks, seals, stingrays, lobsters, and other small saltwater fish. I think tickets are about $25, but there's plenty of buy one get one free offers around town. Plenty of restaurants and places to walk to around also. Occasionally they host special events which lower the crowd level a bit. Mostly tourists go here, one of the main attractions of Long Beach",TravelerJoe77
40,Fishy Fun,"Plenty of parking, a great place to be entertained and educated. Well cared for and kept up, Full of families enjoying a family day out, and learning something about our water friends.",Mike90275
40,"One of the nicer aquariums, bit pricey","This is one of the nicer, well maintained aquariums, and I've been to quite a few. Everything was clean and well kept. The variety of sea life is good, and penguins are always fun to see. Still, nothing terribly special about it, but it is nice.I especially enjoyed listening to the different whale calls on the touch-screen.We bought combo tickets for the aquarium and a visit to the Queen Mary. Still on the expensive side, I thought.",redningja
50,Interactive exhibits are great!,"My girls love this place. They have a lot of petting tanks for jellyfish, rays, and even sharks. My wife and the girls visit pretty regularly since we have a season pass. Every time the girls go, I hear about it all that night. Prices for individual visits are a little steep, but the season passes are a great deal if you plan to go more than once or twice in a year.",Brad C
40,Nice aquarium in the greater LA Basin,"It was my first time at this aquarium. I've only been to the Monterey Bay aquarium so not really fair to compare any other to that great venue. I wasn't expecting much but friends had been multiple times and said it was a nice place. The aquarium isn't that big and you can probably see it all in four hours, including the mini 15-min shows they have scattered about. Outdoors has three small pools: seals, sharks and penguins. We liked the seal and sea lion show the best as it has the most action. There is much more inside on the two floors - very nice displays of sea creatures and fish. We did not go to the main movie, but they show a short one on the walls of the great hall every few minutes. The lorikeet bird pen is interesting, but you probably don't need to buy the nectar as most of the birds seemed full and children were abandoning their cups which sat neglected. Save your money instead for your own snacks or lunch. We ate at the Scuba buffet room. Some hot meals, but we had tuna sandwiches with salads which were fresh. A couple of juice and ice cream stands were outside. On the Saturday we were there, it was not that crowded, but most visitors were families. Parking was $8.00 in structure next door. We got our tickets at AAA so paid $19.75 per adult ticket.",monarat
50,Truely amazing,"If you have at least 3+ hours of nothing to do, then go to this place.If you have extra time, then for a few dollars more get the harbor tour as well. I arrived at about 11:30 am and thought it would only take about an hour to go through. Boy, was I wrong. It takes about 3 to 4 hours to go through it all and there is so much to see and do. I really kick myself for not including the harbor tour, but by the time I had seen everything in the aquarium, I was really tired and headed over to supper and then back to my motel. There was live shows, videos, inactive displays, sea creatures of all types. Did you know they have two types of live Sea Dragons? There are several petting pools, where you can touch the different sea creatures. You can feed some real live birds that will land on your hand to eat. This was the best fun I have had in a long time. They are expanding and adding new exhibits and I hope to go again the next time that I am in town, just to see what they have added.",Gerald W
40,"Has improved greatly with time- if you visited years ago, plan to visit again.","When the Aquarium of the Pacific opened over a decade ago, we were excited to have an aquarium in So Cal. To be honest, I was disappointed in the aquarium back thenBut I'm happy to say that things in the aquarium have improved greatly. Many new exhibits were added, a huge variety of fish beautifully displayed.The Reef exhibit alone is worth a visit.Still much of the aquarium is devoted to local fish and the kelp forests.For anyone who loves to learn about and view sea life, this is a worthwhile attraction.",Ronald K
30,Overpriced.,"We were disappointed with the Aquarium of the Pacific. We thought we would have to hurry to see everything in 4 hours, but 2 1/2 hours later we were ready to leave. The whole place seemed shabby to us. Lots of peeling paint and dirty aquarium glass. We realized the it's not easy to keep glass clean with little hands around, but some of the displays looked like the glass had never been cleaned. Come on, Management! It is a great building. Take care of it!",Watermaster
50,Great information and displays,"The aquarium is not huge but the displays and tanks are very informative and enjoyable and you can easily spend 3 hours there reading and learning about the waters and life in the pacific. Kids loved it with the touchable fish. Great to see penguins, otters, sharks and rays. Also a wonderful Lorikeet parrots display. You walk right with the birds and can feed them nectar. Staff and volunteers are at the ready to talk and explain things or answer questions. Nice cafe for sandwiches and soups.",dolls111
30,nice but not overwhelmed,I read the reviews and have to agree that overall the size is somewhat small and I thought expensive for what is there. I went on a weekday so mostly had families with strollers and school groups in house. Lots of hands on stuff for smaller kids but for adults the display areas were pretty minimal. Outside I enjoyed the sea lions and penguins and watched a show or two. A good way to spend a hr or so. What I really did enjoy was the combo ticket that gives you the harbor tour for $12. The area around the aquarium was great so was able to make a full day out of eating at a nearby restaraunt. It was also nice since the restaraunt validated my aquarium parking ticket making the whole days parking $3.50. There is a free shuttle bus that will take you around downtown Long Beach and over to the Queen Mary. Doing the aquarium and some of the side trips made it worthwhile but paying $26 only to see the Aquarium would have been dissapointing. It would be a different experience if I were traveling with small kids.,davidgmg
50,Great way to spend the day!,"Recently visited with my sister and her college-aged granddaughter, and we had a great time. It was early on a weekday, and school had just restarted in the area, so it was not very crowded. We arrived just in time for the feeding at the small shark touch tank, which was very interesting, and also got to observe the feeding at the adjacent touch tank that included hermit and horseshoe crabs and conchs (SP?). Had never actually seen a large conch shell with its original inhabitant, and also got to see a hermit crab molt. Must have been molting season there, as we also got to see an Alaskan crab molt and a couple of other discarded crab shells. Loved all the touch tanks scattered throughout the building! Were not able to see the foxes and the puffins ~ two of our favorite critters ~ but really enjoyed seeing all the other exhibits. A little heavy on global warming and man's destructive habits, but otherwise exhibits and displays very nice. Would have liked to see a really nice cafe with a view of one of the tanks ~ eating out in the open in the foyer seemed a bit off-putting ~ but there are lots of nice waterfront restaurants within walking distance.",GlassInMS
50,They have Penguins!!,"Very fun! and they had just added penguins when i went, so i was thrilled! They have a big variety of fish. Very interesting since i had never before seen most of them!",Monkeysee21

40,Touch a jellyfish and a stingray!,Great place to pat a jellyfish and a stingray! I was here for a conference reception. It was great to be able to touch some of the marine life and see the penguins swimming about outside.,Tui B
40,Beautiful Aquarium,"We visited for the first time on Saturday. The aquarium is very nice with wonderful displays. They kind of push the ""polar bears are disappearing, big oil is awful, the ice caps are melting"" issue a bit too much, but all in all we had a great time.",EricaLyn
40,Fun place to spend a few hours,"Took time out from the trade show I was attending and walked over to the aquarium with my son. The person at the ticket counter noticed our trade show badge and gave us an excellent price for admission. It was even better than the advertised price on the sign. The aquarium was very busy that day, but we still had a good time.",bhillut
50,Always a great afternoon,"Love taking my daughter here to look at the animal life.You can feed the beautiful lorikeets, pet the stingrays, smile at the seal lions antics, and watch in awe at the massive sharks as they swim by.There is also a small play area with water that squirts out for the kiddies.They have educational displays and events throughout the day. They sometimes have cultural events, with Japanese drummers and other community organizations.The cafe has good food and isn't to horribly expensive, and the parking isn't either but they are controlled by the city.You can easily bring small children and watch them be fascinated for hours here, and is definitely a good deal for locals with getting a membership.",David H

40,A fun day for kids and adults of all ages,"You can easily spend about a half a day here, so try to have a few hours available. It's really worth seeing and the kids really love the tanks, petting areas and bird aviary. It's a very modern type of layout, and I like that there are indoor and outdoor areas you can come in and out of.The kids also loved the gift shop... it's a little pricey, but they enjoyed picking out a souvenir. Overall, a nice day with a lot of smiles from the kids!",surfcitydaniels
50,You can spend hours here!,"We went in the afternoon and spent about 3 hours here. Could have spent another 2 hours anyway. We thought it closed at 6pm but it was actually open till 8pm. It was a busy saturday afternoon. Lots to see - the varieties of fish and shellfish was amazing. Took lots of photos. Some species I have come across but hundreds I hadn't. Saw 4 divers in one of the fish tanks - the one with the Giant Sea Bass - and one of the divers gave us a talk on various fish, etc. You can touch jellyfish and some other fishes. It is a must see. Fascinating for young and old alike.",Nette_11
40,Take in the Aquarium while in LA area,We spent several hours looking around the aquarium and taking in the shows. Remember to take your camera since there are some great photos to be taken. There is a lot to see outback so don't miss that part of the facility. We didn't think it was that big when we first entered. Take your time and look around. We combined entrance fees with that of the whale watching so we saved a few dollars.,LovingRetirement67
40,"Interesting and Fun, but Pricey","This aquarium with sleek, modern, and thoughtfully-designed exhibits is worth a visit for those who want hands-on experiences with sea creatures. My son loves sharks, so the shark petting area (Shark Lagoon) was a huge hit. He also got a thrill from touching jelly fish and starfish. There are plenty of films and other activities both indoors and outdoors to keep kids (and even adults) interested. We went in mid-July and it was crowded with lots of kids. Food is available onsite and is a little pricey as is admission generally. General admission is nearly $26 for adults and $15 for kids. If we hadn't had the Los Angeles Go Card, we probably would have passed on the Aquarium because of the price. Figure 3 hours or more in order to take everything in and at least feel that you got your money's worth.",jsctraveler
50,Excellent as Ever!,"As a native of Long Beach, I went to the Aquarium from the time it was new. Now living in AZ, I brought my boyfriend back to see it for the first time. He was very impressed, as was I. My favorite thing, unique to the LBC Aquarium, are the Weedy Sea Dragons....be sure to check them out!",Jaybird61
50,"Did the Behind the Scene Tour, awesome","We decided to do the behind the scene tour offered , $12 per person, as we had been to the aquarium before. It was really neat. You go in above the huge tanks, see babies not seen by the public, see how they feed, meet the divers and so much more. Worth the money.",FlamingoGoes
30,Just Okay,"We found the Aquarium of the Pacific to be just okay. We had planned to spend the day at the aquarium, but found it took no more than 3 hours to see it all. What they have is nice, but honestly it's just a big aquarium. If you interested in visiting an aquarium type place, I prefer Sea World in San Diego. Sea World has some nice aquariums as well as other activities, so you really can spend the day there. As others have noted, the ticket prices are quite high, but luckily for us, we had a half price coupon. As a result, it cost the four of us $50 to get into the aquarium. Had I paid full price I would have been extremely disappointed. Before you go, shop around, and get a discount coupon, because it's not worth the full price of admission.",CoupLand
40,Good Aquarium,"Good aquarium to visit. Good diversity, wide ranging exhibits. They actually have some very rare fish there, which are not labelled. Not that I would know--my son Jared is the enthusiast and was able to point them out. Easy parking, and suprisingly not too crowded for the last Sunday of Christmas break.",ghotai
50,Kids and adults will want to spend hours here!,"As you walk in you are greated by a plexiglass wall 30 feet high that has an amazing aquarium behind it. The main fish in this first tank are tuna, and they are huge! Plenty of interactive exhibits, you can reach into some tanks and touch all types of plants and animals. They actually have decent food here too!",Doug F
10,Terrible value for your dollar,"Visited aquarium first time after Christmas. Ticket prices ridiculously high to enter. Plenty of available shows listed on pamphlet but not enough room to comfortably visit ANY of them. This facility should seriously consider attendance capacity instead of being greedy with ticket sales. Shark lagoon looked like it could have been interesting exhibit but family unable to weed through extremely overcrowded and small viewing areas. Came back to shark lagoon after feeding time and hoped to get a better look, but were still unable to see any living attractions. Seemed like facility was focused on multiple petting exhibits more than actual aquarium tanks. Bathrooms dirty and didn't even attempt to eat or spend more money while inside. This aquarium is a terrible value for the entrance price. DO NOT VISIT HERE.",Kris P
50,Pet a Friendly Sea Creature,"The Aquarium of the Pacific is a first class, quality nature study in sea life. Thoroughly educational on all aspects of oceanic flora and fauna, you can't beat the entertaining videos. Kids can pet sharks and rays and feed the lorikeets too. A real treat!",Michael P
40,Nice setting. Great variety,"This aquarium is set up nicely with a good variety of species. It seems to be pretty crowded whenever I'm there, but that might be because of the quality. Enough to keep the kids busy all day, and keep me well entertained every time I go.",TheParrothead
30,Lots of Kids,Took Japanese visitors to aquarium on a summer day. Wow was it crowded with kids. Hard to move around. Still enjoyed visit.,Connie Z
40,Excellent for young children,"We went here for a visit with our two kids-- a 17 year old and a 20 year old. We had hoped to get to the Monterey Aquarium but chose this one as we were spending most of our time in the L.A. area. From my perspective, Chicago's Shedd Aquarium is among the top 3 in the United States. I would not rank this one as high, but would highly recommend it for young children. The Pacific has lots for kids to see up close and to touch. Tots can put their hands on sharks and rays. They can see over 14,000 live creatures throughout the facility.A few suggestions: Arrive early and go right to the parking garage as it's the only practical place to park your car. Bring your AAA card if you have one. You'll save 10% on your tickets. Since it costs over $100 for four adults, the savings are worth it. Also, check the schedule for the live demonstrations and feedings. The young kids love them!",LikethetripFantastic
50,Fantastic Family Adventure,"Great place for the entire family. Plan the spend the entire day here, there is so much to see. If it is raining your safe indoors. If not, go outside and pet the sharks, or feed the lorikeets. The new penguin exhibit, outside near the sharks hold at least a dozen cute little guys that are fun to watch. My son loves watching the sea lions and seals swim and play. Your inside a tube with glass on both sides and they can swim under and around you so you don't know where they will pop up. The divers are one of my son's favorite attractions. And if you arrive early enough, you can see them feed the fish in the large tank. The whale also puts on a show in the lobby. The lights dim and a slide show talks about endangered ocean species. The whale sounds announce the show. The otters are also fun to watch, weather they are on their backs outside the water, or in the water playing, they are lively and very cute. The cafeteria is pretty good--not great--but the Market salad is very simple, clean and nutritious, without lots of calories. The pizza slices are so big my son and his cousin (4 yo and 2 yo) split one slice.",mariachurchill
50,If in even looks like rain head here!,Went here to fill a hour or so and stayed for 4. It is a great place with kids. The touching tanks were really cool. Sharks and manta rays the kids could touch. The displays inside were also well lit and interesting. The area has some other stuff (Queen Mary) but the Aquarium was plenty and we grabbed a bite and went back to La. Check it out.,DrBob5
30,Rainy day @ the Aquarium,"All the shows were cancelled...you think they would give you something to make up for that. Nope. Walked around and kids enjoyed the sharks and birds the most. Don't eat at Scuba Cafe, yuk for the tables and meh for the food. Service is sucky. Beautiful aquariums and many sea creatures to watch. Would go again in the summer though.",ohtheplaceswego2
40,"""Marine life that thrives in the Pacific""","Viewing marine life in near natural habitat is very relaxing and educational. I enjoy aquariums and the Aquarium of the Pacific was a real surprise. The show stoppers are the penguins, sea otters, and the petting pools for the youngsters. Other exhibits of interest include the varieties of jellyfish, tropical fish, sea urchins, starfish, sharks, and other large fish. Some unusual tanks of sea horses and other marine life add more to your experience. Compared to other aquariums, this one ranks below Monterrey in northern California (favorite) and the Shedd in Chicago. Admission rather pricey as well, so look for coupons if taking the family. Can also couple this with visits to other attractions in Long Beach, like the QE2. Note that climate change is a topic of persuasion, a little over the top in most cases. Worth the visit if in the area.",Shuttrrbug
50,Love the penguins.,"We love to visit the aquarium once a year. It is a great place to watch animals in ""natural"" habitats. The aquarium does a great job with displays, habitats and information on the animals. My daughter also attends a week long summer camp that is by far the best camp we attend all year.",KCfromMT
50,Much more than I expected,"My boyfriend love to go to aquariums and have visted several all over the United States (and even one in Iceland). This one kind of blew me away! They have great shows where they talk about the different animals/fish and show some tricks, try to catch all of the shows if you can! My favorite were the sea otters. This place has amazing touch tanks, I have never touched so many species in one place, you can even touch some sharks! A definite must see if you're in the area!",Ellie H
40,Very nice and enjoyable way to spend a few hours,"Nice surprise, nice place to get get to know our Pacific water friends. Especially nice were the shows, catch as many as you can. Wonderful way to view, some of the best built aquarium areas in the country. It can be a bit pricey for a family though. Be sure to get an Entertainment book for this one and take advantage of the 2 for the price of one coupon inside, made it seem more reasonable. In addition will have to pay to park.",northernk
40,A little sea to see while in Long Beach,"This is not comparable to the Monterey Aquarium, but for a few hours, it is certainly worth the visit. There are giant tanks filled with beautiful fish and many other creatures of the ocean to see. It is easy to get around and the little ones will love it. I know our group did. A good thing to do before or after a Carnival cruise or while visiting the Queen Mary as the Long Beach shuttle bus will take you there and back for free!",Faye G
40,A fine example,"As my kids are now edging toward the end of the Aquarium/Zoo demographic we have visited a good number of these. The Aquarium of the Pacific is towards the top end. It is well laid out and well located in Long Beach with a host of other near by attractions.The aquarium is self is lacking a single awe inspiring exhibit but makes up for it with a bunch of good ones. The layout is a lower lever with exhibits, a nice out side area and a smaller upstairs.The exhibits are well done and the volunteers are great! Very passionate about doing there jobs.Downtown Long Beach is suffering a bit with the economic down turn so the near by retail complex are not as vibrant as they once were but there are still plenty of places to eat near buy.Over all is this a nice stop on a trip to downtown Long Beach.",oldensign

The sea lions seemed to have outgrown their exhibit--fighting and nipping a lot more than others I've seen at other aquariums and zoos across the U.S. The most senior staff member who works in the gift shop at the entrance was outstanding--really made me and others who weren't in my party feel welcome. The vents above the whales models, and the backs of whales themselves need cleaning.",D S

40,A must-do in LGB,"This is a very good aquarium and the employees seemed to be very knowledgeable. The shows hit the right tone of conveying information to the lay person while throwing in the occasional tidbit that appeals to the biologist in me.My only recommendation would be an adults-only time. I know aquariums are built for children, but a one-night per week event would be welcome for those who wish to visit the aquarium without millions of kids bowling you over.",Alan J
50,A great place to visit.,"This was our first visit. We also took the behind the scenes tour. It turned out that only myself and my wife participated. We had the guide to our selves. It was awesome, I recommend this to anyone. On the whole the aquarium is very kid friendly. The exhibits are all beautiful, displaying the animals very well. The otters are my favorite. The aquarium should not be missed.",Brian K
50,A must place to visit!,"We loved this place! Even though we had no small children, it was so worth it. The bird exhibit was so fun, I could have spent hours in there. Touching the jellyfish was interesting. We have been to Shedd Aquarium in Chicago & honestly I prefer this one. I highly recommend this for all ages. You can find coupons on the Internet for 5$ off general admission.",theclayturtle
50,Don't miss this Aquarium,"For Fish, Facts and fun, don't miss this world class aquarium. It's great for whole family. The exhibits are very nicely done. All the animals are from the 4 corners of the Pacific Ocean. There exhibits that make you think about your stewardship of the ocean even if you don't live near the beach. We planned for a couple of hours and stayed all day. Kids loved touching animals. The docents really knew their stuff. The scuba divers gave conservation talks form underwater and we watched them try to catch a fish to move it to another tank - the fish won! We will go back again.",Jeanne S
50,Field trip!,"My 5 year old son loves this place. It's a great opportunity to see ocean life. So many exhibits! My son loves hanging out with the rays and being able to touch them. Plenty of parking. Bring some snacks if you plan on being there all day. If you're local, buy the membership it's totally worth it.",TheKurtzKrew
40,Didn't expect such a great aquarium in Long Beach,"First trip to Long Beach, mainly to see the aquarium (we all have things we like to see). Went on a Tuesday when it opened in the morning. When I gave my ticket to the person at the door (volunteer), she told me there would be about 1200 kids there in about 1 1/2 hours. End of school field trips. It was still worth the hassle of getting through kids. Exhibits were very good, and the shark and ray pools outside were better than I would have thought. Might go back again during the summer when school's not in!",lindalindabm
40,Soooo Cooool,It's a huge facility with lot's to check out. A great date spot for a daytime date. It really let's you get into how much life there is out there in the Pacific. If you love nature and particularly the ocean you gotta check this out.,Geoffrey S
40,Nice Place to See Sea Life Comparism,"Not as great as the Chicago Aquarium, Mandalay Bay Aquarium but on par with Monterey Bay Aquarium & better than Oahu Aquarium! Try to time your visit to feeding time, which I have some nice photos below.",airebornranger
30,Good for kids,"I didn't find the aquarium to have a large variety of animals... mostly lots of fish. It was clean and well kept and is definitely a nice attraction for families with little kids. I'm an adult who went by myself while visiting Long Beach on a business trip, and was looking for something to do to occupy some free time I had one afternoon.",Nancy8041
50,"Beautiful, interesting for all ages","The extensive exhibits are fascinating for all ages. True, it is expensive, but maintaining this facility must cost a fortune. Family memberships allow those who live nearby to come more often. We were there on a rather quiet day and were easily able to enjoy each area. We look forward to visits again.",Joangoodcook
40,Loved it - but was a bit expensive,$50 for two people seemed a bit much but we went in anyway - i enjoyed the place but I think the price was a bit high for what we got. There were no markings when feeding time was going to happen so of course we turned up right at the end (along with everyone else) and it was kind of hard to figure out where you should start. The little pools inside where you could touch starfish and stuff should have had more help as no one was really helping the kids and the line got backed up. The otters were GREAT and I could have just watched them all day. Not sure I would go back again.,anisopterax2
50,A little treasure,"We hadn't expected much of this, but were really impressed. A lot of exhibits and very well laid out and informative. Definitely worth a visit. Buy a ticket to combine a harbour tour or whale watching in season - saves a few dollars!",Helen T
30,Pass Holders No Longer,"We used to have annual passes for the aquarium, but then after several trips it no longer held my children's attention and not much changed exhibit wise, so we decided to no longer buy the passes. Good for those who have never visited, but with Sea World so close, it's a better option, although more expensive.",cakseevers
50,Aquarium - Mesmerizing,"Think if you have seen one fish, you have seen them all. Not true. The Magellanic Penquins at the Aquarium will keep you there all day if you allow yourself to come under their spell. This is an all encompassing acquarium with animal feedings, shows, and behind the scenes tours. Choose whatever your budget allows. But do go! I had a business meeting and my husband reluctantly agreed to go to the aquarium while I was gone. You should have seen the smile on his face when I returned. He was so happy he had gone. He liked it all but he loved the penguins. He was amazed with the aquarium.",4c1h
40,Great for kids,Lots of space and interactive exhibits for the kids--so many things to touch! Also a fun outdoor water play area. Interesting for all ages.,Linda W
40,Great family activity,"This is a great aquarium. We took our 1 1/2 year old and newborn. My son was fascinated and loved every minute. He didn't have a problem skipping his nap he was so excited. It's just enough stuff to do to fill one day. There could have been more food available for lunch, but overall we had a great day.",Rosie S
50,Well worth the price.,"It is so much fun to spend the day petting sharks, bat rays, and jelly fish! Thanks to the aquarium, I have a future marine biologist on my hands.",McInroy-Edwards Family
50,"Impressive collection, beautiful tanks!","Well worth a trip! The boy loved it, very kid friendly. Remarkably good value, spent five hours easily!",mghtycthul
40,Nice aquarium & Good package for whale watching cruise,"The aquarium has so many marine lifes and nice experiences that we can touch & feel with some of them . I have spend more than 3 hours inside . Besides, if you wish to go for whale cruise, I would suggest you may get the package for both aquarium entry+ whale watching ( around USD 60 include tax) .That's will be much cheaper if you buy near the dock . The whale watching was another awesome memories , if you're lucky you might see those whales , else you at least will see dolphins, sea lions & other sea lifes . The cruise will take around 3 1/2 hrs ( p/s: gentle remind to all put on sunblock & bring cap if possible) , the weather is so hot if you depart at 12noon .There was only 2 schedule (12pm & 330pm) .Enjoy & have fun !!",WendyTeh
50,Fun,Just really great. Something to go year round with yearly pass that is tax deductable.Kids love it too.,anne g
40,More than Expected,Our Family has now been here 3 times and I am still amazed at the variety and hugeness of their tanks. Great time for the family and then Shoreline village and Downtown Long Beach with all of its great restaurants are nearby. Queen Mary is very close also. Great place to spend the day.,kevin p
40,See things through the eyes of a child,"When I was a lot younger, I loved to go through the aquarium at Golden Gate Park, San Francisco. This one in Long Beach is a small one, not like Seaworld or anything like that. But they have pool where you can touch the little sharks or were they the sting rays like the Monterey Bay aquarium. Just bring a child and they will show you the way.",LizC2012
40,Nice place to while away time,"A decent aquarium with a good shark pool, plenty of staff on hand to talk you through lots of sea creatures. If your into the aquatic you should enjoy this place",1Sheermadness
40,nice experience,"Took my 3.5 year old and 6 month old. My older son loved it. Nice facility, very clean. My only complaint was the food on site - prices are ridiculous. I was going to have lunch and they had a pizza slice/salad combo for $8.75. I can't eat salad greens due to Inflammatory Bowel Disease so I asked about getting just a slice of pizza. Still $8.75. Crazy!!!! We left and went to Chili's for lunch and came back later to aquarium. However, prices in the gift shop seemed reasonable.",Sabrina M
40,Worth a visit,"I love aquariums and marine mammals and never miss an opportunity to visit. I liked this aquariium, but if you have been to the one in Vancouver or Baltimore you may be a little disappointed. There were plenty of exhibits, although not a tremendous amount of information offered about them. I enjoyed the shark pool and am always enchanted by the sea otters. You can combine the ticket with a harbour cruise. I have to say - don't bother - although pretty cheap - about $7.00 I think - it was not really worth it. The food in the cafeteria is very expensive so go out for lunch - there are plenty of options. Don't forget to get your hand stamped or they will quiz you when you try to get back in again!",B0urnem0uthTraveller
50,Great Day at the Aquarium,"A wide assortment of healthy exotic and typical aquatic life. Loved the penguin tank and the sea horse tank. Others loved the fact that everyone can touch sharks, jellyfish and sting rays. Quite educational. Staff well prepared to explain each tank. Tours available. Scuba divers feed the fish in one of the main tanks. A very large aquarium well suitable for adults and children. There can be many children so be prepared. Everyone seems to want to take pictures with the animals. You will not be disappointed but it is expensive.",CarpeDiem45
30,Expected a little more,"For the cost, we expected there would be a little bit more to see, but overall, we were able to spend a few good hours at the aquarium. There are a few exhibits where you are actually able to touch rays, sharks (small ones, of course), urchins, starfish, etc. A couple of hours is sufficient time to see it all.",stella306
40,That's All Folks,"Cost to get in, $25 a person. Was it worth it? Yes and no. There are some great exhibits and two levels of it, but I was expecting a much bigger place. We did have a blast, me watching the diving birds and the sea otters, so that was good. If you want to see the really big fish, I recommend Sea World.",Rachel R
30,Get up close!,"Great little spot to feel some of our sea freinds, like the ray and starfish. Great view of the seals and enguins as well. Though you don't need a full day here, it is worth coming by to enjoy the sea life!",LauraY23
40,Night time Aquarium,We got reduced price entry as we came to the late night opening the day before the Long island Grand Prix.This place was great very infromative and the interactive exhibits (esp rays) made this a geat trip,JohnandNibs
50,Sea Dragons,There was a beautiful exhibit of jellies with black lighting. Then up stairs there is a tank with sea dragons. They are the coolest critters floating among the seaweed. Tough tanks for the non squeamish.,Lincam
50,Aquarium of the Pacific,Discover what Southern California locals have known for a long time: the Aquarium of the Pacific is a great place. I recently went on a tour of Long Beach looking for family-friendly activities for cruise visitors. The Aquarium of the Pacific is close to the ships and makes for a fun and educational excursion.,CruiseBuzz
40,Great Family Experience,We had a lot of fun here and after we were done at the aquarium we walked around the harbor and found a restaurant to eat dinner! Great experience by far and would definetly come back to the aquarium and i loved long beach!!!,Sam P
50,Exellent Activity for a Trip with kids to LA,"Wen t to the Aquarium with a 4 years old and a 1 year old they love it! a lot of interactive tanks, in a very good condition. the 4D movie is good , but a little scary for the little ones",TheOsorios
50,Aquarium,I did some volunteer work there for a year in the lorikeet forest. This aquarium is beautiful and they have so many wonderful animals.,GinaR643
50,Great place to take the kids and just walk aroung,"What can I say, all kinds of sea life everywhere. You name it they have it. We like walking around and try to see everything. Take the kids they will love it.",clarkcj77
40,Interesting aquarium,It is just so crowed on weekends. If you can go on a different day it would be more enjoyable.They do special events and there are also cupons if you plan ahead.,Babs074
50,Great time had by all,"Our family enjoyed everything they had, especially the sea horse exhibit. They had every type of sea horse & sea dragon imaginable. The facility was very interesting & inviting.",Shane B
50,Aquarium of the Pacific,You can go wrong at the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach! It never gets old when you see fishes and other animals up close and personal. It is a great place to hang out for the day when in Long Beach and great places to eat just outside of the aquarium.,BedBuggin
50,Great family outing!,Love this place. . . Especially feeding the lorikeets!!! Great place to bring friends and relatives.,Lynette T
40,The staff are great,We spent a good few hours here and had a wonderful time. The staff are good at keeping you informed and making sure you're enjoying everything. We got to touch stingrays and we watched them feeding the sharks all the while learning interesting facts. I would come back again,Coleraine3
50,loved it,"great day with young kids (baby to 6 years old) a weekday in september and it did not seem too busy. lots to see and touch, perfect for this age group. we spent a whole week exploring newport beach and touching the starfish at the aquarium was my 4 year olds favorite part. I thought admission was reasonable and parking garage prices ok with admission ticket. went out to eat after at one of the many sit down chain restaurants within walking distance. we found staff to be friendly and helpful.",mommysunshine
50,Fun Day,"We got a family pass to here for my son's birthday, so we go here all the time. They have a few touch tanks that have things like sharks and jelly fish which my son loves. They have some great fish there as well as a bird area. I have not bought any food here so i don't know if it is expensive or not. They do change some of the exhibits around so it is not always the same old thing. Even my baby enjoys going and looking at all the colourful fish. It does take about half a day just to walk around so sometimes when we go we only do one floor or the other, which takes about 1-1/2 hours to walk around. But overall a really nice place.",Kelly P
40,Absolutely loved it!,"My husband and I brought out daughter here for her first birthday, at first I didn't think she would really get what was going on, but to our surprise she love it! She pointed at all the fishes from the very beginning. By the end of the day she had learned a new word, ""fishy"" :) it's great here, they have many things to see here. Fish, sharks, jelly fish, star fish, etc. the list is endless. They even have a scuba diver that gives fun facts from inside the tank. I loved touching the jelly fish and the sting rays. We also got to see the penguins. The only downside was that the aquariam is filled with kids from schools on field trips during the week so therefore that means many un supervised kids running wild. It wasn't much of a problem up until we had rude people shoving us while they squeezed their way to the front of the tank while the sharks were being fed and pretty much at every other tank as well. It also sucked that the otter show ends pretty early. So we didn't get to see that. Overall it's a great place. We didn't pay extra to pretty much go behind the scenes, but we will next time since we saw a family that got to go up and close to the penguins. It's a fair price too. So I would definitely recommend the aquarium of the pacific for a nice family outing where you can also learn new things :)",usmcartywife
40,"Excellent Collection, But Pricey!","Shows sea life from around the world, best range of sea and bird life (loved the Lorikeets!) Even with AAA discount, very expensive admission and food.",torontogal-99
40,penguins and sharks,Spent a lovely half day here .Some amazing displays and very educational. i thoroughly enjoyed it and the children will love it.Highlight for me was stroking the small sharks and stingrays,Brian B
50,Awesome Place,We spent the afternoon at the aquarium. Everyone loved it. Petting the sharks and stingrays is awesome. Enjoyed seeing all the different fish.,tf1965
50,Just Fascinating,I've been to the Aquarium at least a half a dozen times and I learn something everytime. I love watching other peoples reaction to some exhibits... especially the children... they're so excitied and it's infectious. For a nice afternoon and a stroll on the promenade afterward you can't beat this attraction. Prices are fair and parking is terrific. Sometimes it's pretty crowded but there's plenty of room for everyone :),revolor
40,wonderful aquarium,This is a large impressive aquarium with a wide variety of sealife. There are areas to touch some of the animals too. There are beautiful setups and just a wonderful experience.,jelico8
50,If you want great interaction this is the place!,We love this Aquarium! Lots of interaction with aquatic life. It is not a huge place but what they have is very impressive and interesting. Definitely worth it to get the annual membership if you can! We will be back again and again.,cimko2012
40,Small Aquarium,This is a better aquarium for children than adults. It's small but does allows some petting opportunities.,GoingGoingGone123
30,much smaller than I thought it would be,"I have been to a lot of aquariums and so I had high hopes for this one, however, it was small, overcrowded, and the people were so rude I would not ever go back. People need to learn manners and they need more tanks for exhibits.",fancithatt
50,Great to kill some time!,"I went here with my husband, son, and brother before a wedding at night. What a great aquarium! The tanks are so well taken care of and so big! Lots of different species to observe. Didn't get to watch the seal show since it was busy but loved the penguins and the little water exhibit for the kiddos outside. Even got to feed some beautiful birds some nectar. Will definitely visit here again!",Sarah H
30,Just OK,"I visited the aquarium with my son, but was disappointed with the size and value of the complex. Lots of staff members seemed bored and showed a general lack of interest. The food was expensive and the whole experience was very disappointing",PearceFamily
40,Nice afternoon,"I love this aquarium, but only when the children are in school. If you go during the early part of the school year (September-November) there are not a lot of school children, so you can walk and look at your leisure, without having to step on little people.",Jennifer T
50,Great aquarium,"This is the perfect place to see some really interesting sea creatures. It's not Sea World. There are no dolphins, rides or whales but their sea otter exhibit is much better than Sea World's and they have a far greater variety of fish. Prepare to be educated about how much humans have screwed up the oceans with exhibits such as Poles in Peril and the Ocean Science Center and to be educated in general about what the fish here eat and where they live, etc. The halls are divided into the four areas of the Pacific: Northern Pacific, Tropical, Southern Cal/Baja, and Arctic/Antarctic. I could have spent all day watching the Weedy Sea Dragons—very cool creatures. Get there at 9:00 when it opens and if it's hot, see the outside exhibits first: sharks, lorakeets, penguins, seals then come inside where it's air conditioned. Get your hand stamped and walk to one of the many restaurants in the area for lunch (PF Changs, CPK, Chili's, Bubba Gumps) or bring your own food and eat on the picnic benches out front or beneath the lighthouse on the hill next to the Aquarium. A schedule is provided of ""show"" times; in Tropical Pacific a diver feeds a huge swarm of sharks, rays and fish—a must see. You can also buy food to give at scheduled times to the rays and sharks in the touch pools. There's a play area for kids where they can get wet on a hot day so bring a change of clothes. Keep your car parked and ride the free red bus to the Queen Mary down the road if you want to spend the whole day here. Otherwise, four hours is enough to see everything.",love4pugs
50,Thanks!,"I LOVE the aquarium! They have amazing animals there and wonderful attractions there as well. Their information about the animals, their habitats, and the world in general are astounding. If I lived any closer I would definitely have a membership. I'll be sure to come again soon!",Emily M
50,Love this place!,"This has become one of those must do places for our family when we are in LA. I've been there about 5 times and would like to go another 5 times. If I lived in LA, I would have a membership.Be sure to go outside! Visit the lorikeets. Oh, they are great! If you're lucky, one will sit on your shoulder, Watch your fingers, though! These guys bite!Then there is the outdoor shark touch tank. Let's just say that seeing is believing. Way way way cool!BTW: Members of our family (2 aging adults, young adult son) have visited about 20 aquariums in 3 countries and this is one of 2 favorite US aquariums. Shed in Chicago is the other. Have not been to Monterrey Bay or Atlanta but hope to go soon.",Cybermama
30,OK Aquarium,The Aquarium of the Pacific isn't as large or as interesting as the Monterey Bay Aquarium in northern California. One of the more interesting parts of the aquarium are the touch tanks. You can pet baby sharks and bat rays. There is also a bird aviary. It's a nice place to visit if you're in the Long Beach area seeing other attractions.,CentralCoast2
50,great aquarium,"there is a lot to see and do here and it is worth the price of admission. I have been to the aquarium in atlanta gergia and honolulu and the long beach aquarium is nicer and more things to see. after you are done in the aquarium, there is a lot more to see outside. plent of places to eat, boat cruises and walking around the marina. they even have bike rentals. bring your own bikes and ride around and save a couple bucks.",timhoeve
50,Fun for the whole family,"This Aquarium is Good. Saw many different animals. We got there early and purchased the tickets online so there was no lines. We walked right in!Since we were there early, there was no lines to see the fish or seals. There was pleanty of time to see each exhibit. The hands on exhibits were the best. Touch a star fish and sea annemone. Then touch a small shark and bat ray.With all the touching, there were plenty of hand sanitizer and washing stations around.This place is perfect for families with small children because the aquarium is not large. Two - three hours max. Our group included 13 year old boys and they were done even sooner.Behind the aquarium is a picnic area along a grassy knoll to have lunch. You have a perfect view of the queen mary and the ocean and a light house.There are public restrooms outside the aquarium near the picnic area. All very clean and well lit.Purchasing the tickets online saved us a few bucks per ticket and no waiting in line when you arrive. Parking was $8.00.",ScenicSue

30,Nice hands on exhibits-good for children,"We visited here with a 7, 11, and 13 year old. The 7 and 11 year old really enjoyed it and the 13 year old was ok. The aquarium is much smaller than others we have been to such as baltimore and Camden but has some neat hands on exhibits for the kids such as jellyfish, stingrays, and shark. There also is a larakeet feeding area where you can feed the birds for $3. Adults and kids loved this activity.They had a sea lion show and presentations throughout the day.As long as you are not expecting too much this is a nice aquarium to visit for 2 hours maybe a little longer. If you are expecting a Sea World then keep moving and don't stop.",HB92397
30,Just OK...,"Once you've been here there's no need to go back again and again. The exhibits are nice and the place is well maintained but fish are fish. The main hall does make a great event space, however, like for weddings, etc.",Diane W
30,Improving their displays but could be better!,"I have been here three times and still come away wishing the experience had been better. The Aquarium displays are not inviting because many viewing windows are small and some are poorly labeled. The first large hall is devoted to environmental issues and, while valuable, could probably benefit from less signage so the impact of the photos could tell the story. There are very small displays of jelly fish and seahorses, always popular sea creatures. The otter exhibit has a very large curved display tank but get there early to get a good viewing spot. The best parts of the Aquarium are outdoors - sharks, manta rays and lorikeets. There were very few lorikeets on display this Spring while last year there were dozens. The poor artic foxes looked bored cooped up in a small display area. Docents and staff need to be better utilized and interact with visitors. The outdoor play area has to go! Even a painting of the continents and oceans or sea animals would be a better use of the valuable space. Small children and older adults need to take the (one?) elevator because the stairs to the second level are many. The entry fee is steep so look for times, events where you do not pay regular price. The gift shops, souvenirs and food areas are the first things you see upon entering rather than the model of a blue whale hanging from the ceiling. This aquarium should be world class and a true educational experience. Getting better but needs to put education first.",101travelers
40,Very Educational!!1,"While visiting Southern California, we decided to visit this attraction. It was a very educational experience for our young children, and it was very clean. However, it was overrun with aquarium day-camp kids who were sometimes unsupervised and generally out of control.

40,Educational and fun but small and expensive,"This is a neat little aquarium. I have been to several like Monterrey Bay and Tampa, Florida all of them tend to be pretty expensive, but this one is significantly smaller than any other and can be pricey. If you look around for a special sometimes you can find them. There are a lot of great interactive educational displays and presentations. The Jellies are amazing as are the Sea Horses. Monterrey is a lot bigger with many more displays. If you are looking for somehting less expensive although a lot smaller than this there is the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium accross the bridges in San Pedro.",travlinpastor

I brought 2 cameras and felt I should have brought a third! Many people who I show my pictures to almost think I didn't shoot them myself, as there are so many different attractive Marine life displays, It seems unreal to be able to be so close or even be able in some cases to actually touch some living exhibits.

We started later in the early afternoon, but still enjoyed the day and took a walk along the marina around the area and there is alot of dining to enjoy following the aquarium.",family_2go702
50,Beautiful and friendly,"Whether you're an adult or a child, this aquarium has something for everyone. From the amazing array of jellyfish and huge natural tanks to the petting zoo where you can feel a stingray or starfish, this aquarium is a fun stop for all.",Jill_Fish
40,Extensive displays,"Please check out the showtimes and make your way earlier especially for sea lion shows (limited seating) and in the afternoon can be quite hot. The area where you can touch the sharks and the jelly fish is great. Lines can form at the jelly fish touching area. Dont miss out on some the photo op with the concrete penguin, photo came out quite realistically.",sarahtham
30,"Visited with grandson, son and daughter-in-law","Maybe I just expected more. It was okay, but I do not think I will visit again. The exhibits were done nicely, but for some reason I just thought it would be more exciting",Venita J
30,Good but not great,The aquarium in Monterrey is way better. This was still enjoyable though. It just wasn't big enough to hold the crowds.,smileytrips
50,Shark Encounter,Had the most amazing time ever at the aquarium with the shark encounter. We were able to go backstage and prepare food for the sharks. We then donned wetsuits and went into the touch pool and were able to touch and feed the little sharks and the rays swimming about. We then went into the bigger pool and was able to feed and touch the bigger sharks. Seriously recommend this to everyone!!!!! The staff at the aquarium was extremely polite and helpful. Very impressed.,josephinebruin
50,New Penguin Exhibit Worth Seeing,"My wife and I recently went to the Aquarium a couple of months after their new penquin exhibit opened. It is definitely worth seeing. We have been going to the aquarium about once a year since it opened and are aways impressed. They are continuing to add new exhibits nearly every year. We saw the seals & sea lions feeding and show which is great for kids. They also have a nice sea otter display which I like better than the sea otter exhibit at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. It's a little pricey at $25.95 for adults, but you do get what you pay for.",Jerry P
50,Great for the family,"great attraction, see the 4d short movie if you have time...all the exibits were very kool, the giant crabs were awesome as was the california halibutgreat trip",morenoconsulting
50,Great Place for Children and Adults,"Was visiting my daughter in LA and went to this aquarium with my 13 yr old Grandson. It was informative, interesting, great to see all the wild life fish and plants and was a complete pckage.The rest rooms clean, places to eat were wonderful and all in all enjoyed the day. It is layed out so conveniently to accommodate young and old.",Ruth M
50,A nice place to spend some time,"I have been here twice now. A great way to spend some time on a weekend. Good for couples, singles or kids. Very good prices too",Alan W
40,Nice aquarium for kids & adults,"The entire family enjoyed this aquarium today. It is, i believe, the 2nd best aquarium we have visited (2nd to National Aquarium in Baltimore). Very nice balance of hands-on learning and shows along with the usual aquarium exhibits. Good job of showcasing the Pacific sea life.Easy access off of the highway and lots of options for a meal after the aquarium experience. Nice options to purchase a combo ticket with a harbor tour too.",Allen C
30,Fun Few Hours,"Enjoyed the aquarium. Especially loved the tropical reef fish area. Would have given it 4 stars except it was a bit over the top with the not so subtle references to global ""climate change"" being the cause for all the ills of the sea/world at every turn.",BLeiSV
40,Great place for kids to explore,My grandchildren love the hands on exhibits and the shows. They have learned a lot about the local ocean.,jbeyer
50,An excellent experience,Wonderful for kids!! I was a teacher and used to take my class. The staff is wonderful and friendly. The children always loved it.,Erica G
50,Great time!,Spent several hours touring the aquarium. Many exhibits to view. The bird sanctuary is amazing!,DebbieG29101
40,Nice 1/2 day trip,Priced fairly well for what you see. It's interesting to see what you could be swimming with when you are in the ocean.,myopinionz
30,Not impressed,"Of all of the aquariums we've visited all across North America, this was pretty boring.",Kent L
40,Small but jam-packed,"We live in SD, so we frequent the SD Zoo and Sea World a lot. But I will say, I have never seen Otters play non stop with each other, get to watch a deep sea diver feed sharks and sting rays or touch moon jelly fish. This place was able to be conquered in 6 hours by myself, husband 3 children (ages 11, 10 and 8). But it was extremely full of hands on activities and informative videos. We were a little bummed that it seemed every time we found an area we could touch the sea life they made us take our hands out because it was feeding time and patrons did not get to feed them. We just needed to figure out their feeding schedule better. My kids got a huge kick out of the penguin exhibit. There was a fun little window they could watch penguins from. The 4 D Turtle movie was very cute. We were also impressed with the restaurant on site. The food was freshly cooked and not too over priced. We had a great day and don't know if we'll return anytime soon, but definitely glad we can say we've been there.",Kaiyasmom
40,Great for kids,"Definately kid frindly place, perhaps too friendly...kids do not want to leave...and when they do, the purchase of a souvenir is necessary.",HumbertoM
40,Well worth seeing,Collections cover the entire Pacific Ocean- from tropical fish to sharks.,MargeBee12
40,Fun and interesting,"While this is not the biggest aquarium I've been to, it was a very enjoyable and informative visit. We included a whale watching trip while we were there and, although it was near the end of the migration season, we did see some grey whales and young but not very close. However, there were dolphins in abundance swimming close to the boat and the trip was worth it just to see them.",Greg S
50,Amazing Sealife! Great views in Shorline Village!,"This is definitely a world class aquarium. It is so beautifully designed and visitor friendly! We loved the big tank in the main area as well as the huge Blue Whale hanging from the ceiling!What an amazing array of sealife from all around the Pacific Ocean and so well set up for even the first time visitor. The docents and staff are so helpful. And this Aquarium is right on the water in downtwon Long Beach. Spend time enjoying the otters, the sea lions, the shark tank and so much more. We just loved it! And if you don't want to eat at the Aquaruim walk around the little harbor to all of the incredible restaurants in the Shore Village Marina that are right there. The parking structure for the Aquarium is so close. And what's great is that it's all happening right on the waterfront at the end of the Long Beach (710) Fwy. What an incredible time! Just beware, it gets really busy in the afternoon and sometimes that makes the exhibits hard to view",boloca
50,"Nicely laid out, good variety","Huge displays, lots of touch tables, nice variety of fish. Nice aquarium. Go right when it opens, because it gets busy around noon.",fK8b0c6m
50,Awesome place!,Gorgeous surroundings and very cool/informative things all over this place! I would definitly go back!,Tristen C

50,must visit,Great place to visit. I was amazed by all the different displays. Another place I would go back to if I get the opportunity,Mark A
30,Nice family atmosphere,"Liked the educational aspect of the setup and layout. Didn't care for the global warming PSA, but I suppose that's to be expected at any location dealing with water and oceans. Liked the large tank in the center and the many view points to see the seals.",Navy_Lady
50,Fun!,"This is an awesome aquarium! While parking was a mess to figure out and it was packed with people, all the creatures to see made it worth it! You got all your basic sea creatures plus interactive things to go along with the tanks. A variety of animals to touch including sting rays and sharks. A must see.",mmeaghann
40,Great Time,First time visit. We are a family with a 3 year old. Great time. Clean. 3 yo daughter loved getting to touch the little sharks. The birds were fun to feed the nectar. Pictures available to purchase of our family. We had a great time.,rondaholler
40,Penguins !!,Crowed with school trips which was a shame but understandable. Well kept aquarium - we loved the sea otters and the penguins. The jellyfish tanks were great. The cafe where we had coffee and snacks wasn't great (tables not wiped quickly enough (but as I say the place was packed). Not a huge place but very enjoyable.,binky59
40,Lots of fish and animal activities for kids,Every local school plans events here so it is best to visit before 10 am or after 3 pm or when school is out. We have a annual membership and go monthly with the kids.,edvonlef
30,once is enough,Excellant tropical tank tunnel . Once u've gone once nothing new exciting,maryl49
50,Much Better than Expected,It was a very nice aquarium and we enjoyed our visit.,hrdirsteins
40,Wonderful but too crowded,Worth going and is a must visit! Is just too crowded however and is hard to view anything with tour groups going through. Loved the otters!,Laura C
50,Great place for families,A very comprehensive aquarium Harbor tour was fun. Lots of shops and resturants. Parking is easy but does cost $8.,kpcamping
50,Great family attraction!,"My grandson loves all things ocean, and the Aquarium did not disappoint! Kids can 'touch' sea creatures, and the displays are awesome. Feeding the lorikeet birds is fun for the kids and adults too! Food inside is a little pricey, so I would suggest eating before you go...ice cream bars start at $4.00. Go online, Pizza hut has 'kids free' with adult ticket coupons. However, tickets are not out of this world, and I felt that I totally got my moneys worth. (Parking is $8.00 cash be prepared)",Remlapm
50,Fun Day!,"Brought family for this visit. I love petting the rays. The Leafy Sea Dragons are my favorite. Make sure you visit the aquarium during the week while school is in session, the kids are unruly and push their way in on every area and you don't get much of a chance to see anything.",JAMROX69CA
40,great couple of hours,Buy your ticket as a combo with Queen Mary to save money as the aquarium is great,ssenit
40,Fun with the Grandkids!!!,Had a great family time here. Great weather & great all around day. Lots to see and a great gift shop too! Within walking distance when we left was a great Bubba Gump's restatrant...which is our grand daughters favorite place.,sunandpalmtrees
40,Small but lots to offer,don't expect to be there all day because the place is small BUT there are lots of sea creatures to learn about and see.,Tiare224
50,Excellent place to visit,Just looking at this from the outside it doesn't look like it would be the place to visit but it was the best aquarium we have visited. Lots of hands on things to do and everyone there was willing to help and super nice,kimberly t
40,Great Place to visit,"Nice Aquarium! Loved the hands on exhibits where we got to touch Jelly Fish, Sting Rays and more.",cjaeris
50,Fun for any age,"I've been to the aquarium multiple times over the years and it's always a good time.The highlights are the ""touch-tanks"", where you can pet: stingrays, sharks, jellyfish, and plenty of other creatures! Kids LOVE this.I also love the lorakeet exhibit, where you can purchase a sweet drink ($3?) and carry it in your hand to have lorakeet birds land on you and drink out of your hand.They have an outdoor show which is pretty good, lasts about 20 minutes.There is a restaurant where you can expect to pay fairly expensive prices for mediocre food (just like Disneyland, etc).Overall it's a great experience and people of all ages would have a great time.",Jess R
40,a little crowded,It was a nice visit but i dont know if i would go again. it was a bit pricey for what you see and it was way over crowded. I guess its ok to let your kids run around screaming and bang on the glass and run into other people. There is an area outside that allows you to touch sting rays and tiny leapord sharks which is kind of neat. There is a bird sanctuary where you can feed birds and they will just land right on you..but you have to pay $3 for a small cup of necture otherwise you probably wont get that close the birds. I enjoyed the displays and would reccomend checking it out but go first thing when they open so you dont get bombarded with the crowds. If you have kids then i guess anytime would be ok and its deffently kid friendly there and they would love it.,Julie O
30,It was okay.,"We purchased the combo with the Queen Mary which was a good value. My son liked the sharks, sea lions and penguins. But, I just wasn't all that impressed with it. We went on a Sunday and they were crazy busy, it was difficult to see some of the exhibits. Perhaps if we had gone on a weekday we would have had a better experience.",scraphappy256
50,Great for kids,"You can actually touch sharks and rays. Loved the jelly fish display, it's like they are swimming right at you.",Kristi Z
40,Pleasantly surprised,We read and heard mixed reviews. My daughter and I enjoy visiting Aquariums when we travel to new places. We enjoyed our visit here. It's an enjoyable 2 hours with varied marine life to see. When we went on 6/21 there were groups of kids visiting. That was OK. Plenty of room to get around.,mattin54
50,amazing,"Do the combo aquarium and queen mary. take the free passport shuttle bus to queen mary, and the aqua bus ride back to aquarium for $1 per person. such a great experience, the sea otters are soooo cute!",melissa d
50,Excellent,"The Aquarium of the Pacific was a wonderful afternoon filled with beautiful tanks and many touch tanks. The touch tanks, and feeding the Lorakeets was a nice way to break up just viewing the aquariums, it was fun to get our hands wet. Learned a lot too. The Aquarium is a perfect venue for all ages. Parking is easy, gift shop was reasonable. Can't wait to go back and take my younger children.",6jellybeans
50,Ocean life experience,"Feeding seals, life divers communicating with visitirs through huge acrylic glass walls, lot of science and knowledge resources - video, sound, lectures. Worth to see.",Karel K
50,Excellent for all ages!!,"Very well-organized aquarium with a huge variety of ocean creatures. Many touch tanks, knowledgable docents and staff. Great outdoor area for playing, and an aviary where you can feed the birds by hand. Great location for a day trip to Long Beach.",oyyveyy
40,Nice aquarium,Saw the Atlanta aquarium in February. It was amazing but soooo crowded. This aquarium was perhaps not quite as spectacular but was very nice. I must complain about the parking which costs $8 and was without many spaces. The aquarium was very nice though. Indoor and outdoor exhibits. Lots of hands on stuff. Busy but not overcrowded and snack prices not out of line. I got discounted tickets through the MWR and did not pay anywhere near the usual $50 price for two. That was helpful.,lori l
20,A very big disappointment !,I'm just saying don't waste your time or your money. the best part were the seals.,RACEDIVA07
40,Great aquarium for young kids.,"We purchased a family membership two weeks ago and returned for the second time today. Our kids love this place. They have several exhibits that allow children to pet some of the sea animals like jellyfish, small sharks, bat rays. Their favorite is the Lorakeet exhibit where you can buy a cup of nectar to feed the Lorakeets. If you stick out the cup the Lorakeets will stand on your arms or shoulders. The kids love this! Access for people with strollers is a bit cramped but other than that this is a great southern California attraction.",Rafael
40,A very nice attraction,The aquarium was a great place to learn about all the oceans creatures. Amazing how colorful some of them are. I would go again.,Erick S
50,Last years visit during Winter..,"Love the attraction, less kids inline and made it a day of outings and took our time since there are virtually no screaming kids on line. No line to deal with which we love our time together learning about the animals from vetenarian, to petting the live rubbery scary sting ray and tons of education tonal marine live ...we will do this attraction again and again...",jbtujuh
40,Nice aquarium!,"While it may not have been the most expansive aquarium I've ever been to (the Georgia Aquarium takes the cake on that), I spent a few hours here on the last day of an LA spring break trip with my mom, and found it really pleasant. The workers were all incredibly friendly, helpful, and directive, and they seemed to really enjoy their jobs.Petting the stingrays is always a highlight at aquariums! And the galleries here were all beautiful. The most unique aspect setting this aquarium apart from the other half-dozen I've been to before, though, was the Ocean Science Center, a pretty nifty little high-tech show about rising sea levels that runs throughout the day.Ate at the legit and laidback Outback next door, then took a nice little drive through Long Beach. Made it back up to Burbank for a studio tour that afternoon. Would definitely recommend this as something to fill a couple of hours on a trip--also great for kids!",Edna M
50,Fun place to take kids or out-of-town guests,"I love the aquarium! It has lots of interactive exhibits and an outdoor area where kids can run around. I've taken so many out-of-town guests here and they always have a good time. The cost is reasonable too, especially compared to places like Disneyland. We got a membership, which easily pays for itself if you go twice. The membership comes with free tickets, which we gave to out-of-town guests. We just did the membership for the year, but went about 4 times and were never bored.",KMS0782
40,Great local attraction,"Hard to rate excellent after being spoiled by the Atlanta aquarium and Sea World. You only need about half a day at this aquarium. My favorite parts were the sea horses other unique creatures. Very educational and a great place to take children.Admission is pricey, so find cheap tickets through Goldstar, groupon, etc.",dr_pinna
50,Fun With the Grandkids...,"Took my Grandaughters on the first day the Penguins came to town...This wasn't our first trip to th Aquarium and won't be our last...So much to do, but still just enough that Grandparents don't get over tired...Just wish parking wasn't so expensive..",sandymccluskey1953
50,What a great local attraction for Long Beach!,Wonderful sea otter display... brand new penguin attraction... very family friendly...,AnneSoCa
40,A good way to learn about the oceans creatures,"In my party the ages ranged from 26-48, all of us had a great time, so it's safe to say this place is good for all age groups. They offer a Whale/Dolphin watching boat tour, which lasts 3 hours. I wasn't too impressed with the whales, all you see is fins..... we didnt see any jump out of the water or anything like that. But out in the wild you can't expect things. You may see something, you may not. However.....we did get to witness dophins playing, they were even racing the boat. And of course lots of sealions. Once we were off the boat, we toured the aquiarium. Simply beautiful inside. My personal favorite was the comb jellyfish. If you plan on spending longer than just 3 hours in this area, I do strongly recomend you go whale watching. You'll never know what you'll see.",travelcosmolady
50,FRIDAY NIGHT FREE!,Friday nights are free to pet the sharks and stingrays! I am deathly afraid of sharks and I was very proud of myself that I could pet one up close!!! A band was playing the Friday night we were there. And the free admission was an added treat!,Cathy G
50,Great for the family,We love this venue....we bring all our visitors when they come to town,StratoFounder
40,Fun but a little crowded,Fun and affordable but a little too crowded with all the field trips from schools. But the crowds settled down around 1 or 2. Easy to get good lunch nearby when you want a break.,Gerald M
20,It's nothing special.,"It's no SeaWorld nor did I expect it to be. I was expecting an aquarium, this one just doesn't seem as educational or exciting as others. I had been to aquariums all over the country and this one would rank last on my list. No go.",Erika T
50,Great for Kids and the Kid in You!,"So well organized and well documented. Each area has a very well educated and enthusiastic staff member or volunteer. Parking is high but you get half off with a membership. It's both an indoor and outdoor venue so wear a hat and sunscreen. If you aren't with kids, the best time to go would be late afternoon on a weekday. There are a lot of school trips during the school year. My guess is summer is really packed.",palikate
40,Amazing Creatures!!!,"I was given positive and negative reviews of this place, so I checked it out for myself. It's beautiful! I would suggest the late night discount times... because you can take your time and see it in a couple of hours... it's so peaceful and colorful and fascinating. My favorite exhibits are the seahorses and sea dragons.. they're such mythical-looking creatures. :) And I always LOVE touching animals.. such as sharks and rays... and I got to do that, too!",Eiramyzdyl
50,A MUST visit!,"I've been to the aquarium many times and have visited others, around the world, and this one is first class all the way. If you're in the area, don't miss it! Also, don't plan to rush through ... there's so much to see and do ... take your time to enjoy it!",Doggie_Mommy99
50,Oceans,"Wow, what an amazing sight. The oceans is such an amazing place with so many creatures. Being partial to thebigger creatures, whales, occupied most of my time. I love sharks and raises a few in my small tank at home. The knowledge gained from the staff was beyond belief. They know their a stuff. Kids would love it.",dreamwk00
40,Good hands on place,Good place to take kids for the hands on experience. The waterfront around it is a nice place to walk and have a bite for lunch. They also have birds that you can feed.,robert y
50,Aquarium and Whale Watch,"Going to the aquarium was a great choice. We checked online first and were able to get a special web discount for the aquarium and whale watch combo, which made both more worth it. All of the different exhibits at the aquarium were really neat, including places where you can pet sharks and pet jellyfish. The only downside to the aquarium was the penguin exhibit, which was only open to ""aquarium members."" Seeing the penguins was one of the things I was looking forward to, but was not able to enjoy from the wrong side of the barricade. The whale watch was a great experience as well. We didn't see any whales on my trip, but that's not guaranteed, though we did see lots of dolphins. One warning though; wear jeans, bring a coat, and put on sunscreen!! The ride was about 3 hours in the heat of the sun, on the cold cold ocean, so we were freezing and being burnt at the same time. Overall, great day at the Aquarium.",Kat S
50,Great Family Outing,"We spent the afternoon at the Aquarium and loved it.It is in a great location on the waterfront and has many exhibits - pufins, penguins, otters, sea lions/seals, and, of course, fish and sea life.There are interactive exhibits - touch a manta ray, touch a shark, touch a jellyfish.We make a habit out of visiting aquariums and this is right up there with Baltimore in our book.They have Behind The Scenes tours daily and on the weekends options where you can feed an animal - a shark, otter, sea lion/seal, or penguin. Book ahead!",Connie F
40,Sufficient sealife,Recently visited the aquarium. It's a fun few hours for the family. There are no whales or dophins here. The largest animal you'll see is a sea lion. Very simple yet satisfactory for a day of fun and learning about the ocean and it's many wonders. Locations is gorgeous and has many restaurants nearby. A great day out with the kids.,CAgrand
40,Lorakeet exhibit is amazing!,"Getting there when the aquarium opens is definitely the way to go - we did, and were able to view several exhibits in peace before the masses of children arrived. Go to the lorakeet exhibit when it first opens to feed them - they're very friendly!",pentajs
50,Fabulous,"We went to a party at this venue, the food, ambience, and exhibits were spectacular. Highly recommended",tabbyanne
50,Fantastic Aquarium,Got an itch to get yourself an aquarium but don't want all the hassle o maintaining it? Then go to the AOP. It's much easier. Try to go in the mid afternoon. Early in the morning is when all the school kids are there. The place gets almost peaceful after 2pm.,jandlman
50,Easy to experience it all in one day but can get crowded with school field trip groups.,For a smaller aquarium they have done an excellent job utilizing all their space well to offer a wide variety of exhibits. Staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. Gift shop is really good and offers a discount with the annual membership which also includes about 5 or 6 parking vouchers. The setting is beautiful on the shoreline in Long Beach Rainbow Harbor area near Shoreline Village. The food is only okay and over priced. If you get an annual pass (family one is great value) you can go eat at a better restaurant (Bubba Gumps is across the street - and lots of other choices within walking distance) and then return to the aquarium. I think they shouldn't charge extra to see the 3-D movie -tickets are around $3 each for a short movie. The overall experience is great - if you are planning ahead for a one time visit I would call them to find a date not booked with school field trips as those groups tend to not be well supervised and loud.,MomOfSixSanDiego
40,Great Day,"Great family Day Trip. Interactive, educational and a great location. don't forget to check out the nursery",Seeker55
50,a MUST for aquarium lovers,Do not pass up this aquarium! and check out their encounters - you have to book in advance but they were worth EVERY PENNY!,darlene l
50,Awesome place to see.,relatively inexpensive day with much to do nearby.,Mark S
50,Visit the Lorikeets!!,"My family loves to go to this aquarium. It's not the Monterey Bay Aquarium, but it's very nice for the size. My favorite part is the Lorikeet aviary where you can feed the birds nectar. I was so excited to have a bunch of birds perch on my arms : )",LauraRochelle23
30,An OK place to burn a few hours,"It's an OK acquarium. I thought it was extremely overpriced for what it was- $26 to get in and $8 for parking. They do have some good exhibits, but you can do the whole thing in 2 hours. The experience is tainted by the conservationist theme- I felt like every exhibit hall had at least one display or video about how we're destroying our oceans, habitats, etc. Kind of a downer.",Stacy M
30,"Just another fish in the sea, entertaining but could be better.","A delight to the very young, Long Beach's Aquarium of the Pacific is a good ""field trip"" to pique the interest of children, however it is somewhat of a strain for adults and seniors. On the weekday morning we were there, it was swarming with happy children but made it difficulty to view and interpret the exhibits. Most kids were well-behaved but the sheer numbers might have been a Fire Code violation.Later in the day things quieted down and we were able to focus on the Aquarium's good coverage of variations in Pacific coral reef life. The touch-a-shark exhibit served well to educate the public that the vast majority of sharks are harmless and valuable species and not all blood-thirsty ""Jaws"" man-eaters. The sea otters were particularly engaging and seemed to enjoy performing for the public. I wished they had more colorful sea jellies to watch, like in the much larger exhibits at the Monterey Bay Aquarium in Northern California.Exhibits at this non-profit operation are showing their age and are sometimes hard to follow even with the iPhone audio tour app. The recordings didn't always coordinate well with exhibits in the darkened hallways of the ""Great Hall of The Pacific"". Perhaps the app will be refined over time.Parking and food were quite expensive and provided little satisfaction in comparison to the prices paid. Nearby off-site restaurants also seemed very overpriced yet offered only average fare. I advise bringing your own snacks, sandwiches and drinks when practical. Public transit is another good idea as you may use a free bus circulating between the Aquarium and Downtown Long Beach, where there are other sights to see.Bottom line: Give this Aquarium a try, however don't expect a Monterey, Sea World or Atlanta-grade spectacular. It is very entertaining for little kids (ages 3 to 9) but serious adult visitors will need to be patient.",MonkeyOnTheWing
50,Aquarium,"Fabulous displays, changed frequently, childrens touching pools. Excellent family outing. Also whale watching boats leave from their dock daily.",ANonyMouse45
40,very child-friendly,"Smaller than I expected, but lots of different areas, both indoor and out. Hands on for the children - they could touch some of the fish and feed the parrots who would obligingly then sit on them! Also different places you could buy food and/drink.",Lesley M
50,"Aquarium of the Pacific will make your day in Long Beach, CA!","No matter who is visiting me in Long Beach, the Aquarium of the Pacific tops the list for my sightseeng tour. My year-old great-granddaughter loves it (and it was a favorite of her dad's when he was young), as does my 6-year old granddaughter and every adult I've ever brought there. The building itself is a wonder to behold, the curving lines make you think you are inside the ocean. There are fish and other sea creatures from all over the world to view and touch. (You can pet sharks and rays!) You can walk through a garden of larakeets, who will sit on you hands if you like. Otters and sea lions perform in huge tanks and displays. There's even an Arctic Fox to visit with. Divers float in huge tanks and talk with you via radio as they feed and care for the wildlife. As a ""fishy"" Pisces who has visited aquariums all over the world, the Aquarium of the Pacific is still my very favorite place to commune with sea creatures (unless I'm diving among them...)",DSclar
20,False Advertising – The DON’T Have Penguins,"My husband and I made the trip from LA to see penguins as were advertised in the pamphlets that are located around hotels in LA. After arriving at the Aquarium and Paying $25pp to get it, we were advised that the penquins had not arrived yet! Talk about false advertising. The aquarium itself was pretty small and average, it would be more suitable for school day trips, not really suited for adults or teenages.",CCstar14
50,Terrific for Kids & Adults,"This is an all-day visit. There are many rooms and videos that are educational for all ages. The offer stamps at many of the sights that the kids can get marked in their souvenir booklets. Food was decent, too, b/c you will get hungry:-)",Nan V
50,A whale of a good time!,"I saved this for the wrong day...thought it was going to rain but didn't so we spent a beautiful day inside. But parts of the aquarium are outside...it was all good! Very enjoyable, fun and informaative. Will have to do this again as I did not leave enough time to not have to hurry through. We did enjoy it though and my youngest and I ran around the place trying to get all the stamps in the visitors guide! Petting all the creatures was pretty cool, even the jellyfish which I never thought I would do haveing been stung once in my lifetime!",BigSarge03
50,Aquarium,"Recently I was invited to Long Beach, CA, to go to the Aquarium of the Pacific. I have lived in Los Angeles now for over 3 years and had never gone before. Well, I was pleasantly surprised as to how nice it is layed out and displayed! Coming from the state of Oregon, I tend to compare other venues to the ones offered there. This one didn't let me down. The Newport Aquarium in Oregon is wonderful, but the Long Beach one is equally as amazing!This is truly a wonderful day destination to visit for couples , friends or most especially, families!I would say, for Southern California must do's, anyone planning a trip here, should place this in the top 5 on their lists!My favorites, were all the amazing and ethereal displays of jellyfish!, I could watch them for hours!!",HawaiianIrishgirl
40,Avoid the Morning Hours on Weekdays,"This was the last of four aquaria in California that we visited in a whirlwind tour (which also took in Disneyland!). We trekked an hour from Santa Monica to spend a day. The aquarium is not huge, and so a half day would be sufficient to take it all in. The remainder of the day could be spent walking around the waterfront, which looked gorgeous. Highlight of the aquarium is the outdoor ray pool. You can touch the rays, but there is no feeding.All in all, I liked this facility, although I think the Monterey Aqarium is much better in terms of having interactive exhibits.One thing I would like to alert potential visitors: there are several corps of young children that are visiting on field trips on weekday mornings. We started our visit at around 10:30 am and that was a bit of a waste of time because all of the tanks and exhibits were inundated with little children in matching color shirts. If I go back, I would go after 2 pm.Wonderful staff, especially the guy selling plush toys at the gift shop with the octopus on his head.",Mohammedyu
40,Great Place (a bit pricey),"I've been to the Aquarium several times and have enjoyed it complete each time. It's clean, fun and informative. It can be a bit hectic when large groups of children come in, and it can also be too expensive, but it is what one would expect. If possible, try to avoid the food places - the are expensive and the food isn't very good.",mrliterature
40,Good times for the family,"It was fun. However, we went on a Sunday afternoon and it was crazy busy! Way too many people to really enjoy it. I have been to better Aquarium's but my son (2 1/2) had a good time and that is all that matters. It was a little pricey as well",arizcat
40,Good place to vist if you have time,Nice aquarium near the center of Long Beack. Family really enjoyed.,Tmanjk
50,"Great fun, lots to see!","The aquarium was fantastic - incredible fish, sharks, otters and even a chance to touch jellyfish. There's an excellent outdoor area too. We were with 4 children and they loved every minute.",Bonestone
50,fun,clean and its usually not crowded during the week so if ur kids want to touch everything the can with no issues during this time.,Treesa S
50,"I like the Aquarium in Monterrey better, but still wonderful","This is one of the places I would bring kids first in Southern California. They are entranced by the huge aquarium of creatures all swimming around that fills the place. and the smaller side wings with all kinds of jellyfish, etc. The otters are their faces and I could watch otters for hours myself.",Finnagain57
50,Great family entertainment!,Lots to see and do. Not the best value but watch their website and you can grab great deals! The kids love the ray touch pool.,Katherine H
50,What's not to love?,Great for all ages. Love to pet the small sharks. The birds are fun since you are in the cage with them. So many interesting things to see. Great for children. We love the sea lions. :))),Brenda D
50,Fish and kids,"Beautiful, huge aquarium, the second best after the Maryland one and better than the one in San Francisco",Judith I
50,Second time here and still love it,"Visited the aquarium with my 18 month old grandson. Can say that grandparents, great aunt and grandson had a wonderful time. There are enough hands on activities to amuse a toddler. His favorites were the statues that sprayed so he could get nice and wet. He also loved it when the ray in the touching tank splashed him. Obviously the boy loves water. Will definitely bring him back again and again.",Mary S
40,Family Entertainment,"Clean, friendly and very interactive for the kids. Plus it's close to my home and walking distance to many other Shoreline Village activities.",Joni O
40,"It's not Monterey Bay, but still the best aquarium in SoCal.","The Aquarium of the Pacific isn't the biggest or most comprehensive aquarium anywhere, but it really is the best in Southern California (I know, I've looked). It's nice enough that we got the Annual Family pass for $115 so I can bring my kiddos over and over and over again. Parking can be stiff at $8 a pop, but members can buy parking passes for $5 (in a bundle). And for shorter trips, we'll park in the Pike garage across the street and validate at one of the nearby restaurants (3 hours free).Pros: The aquarium is a good size to eat up most of the day, and some of the attractions are really top notch. The Sea Lion/Seal show is a must during your visit. And the Ray touchpool on the upper level and the Jellyfish touchpool in the first room on the lower level were real highlights. The recently remodeled Otter exhibit is decent, and my daughter can spend a lot of time in the outdoor play area which features a few push-button water sprays. We also like the Lorikeet aviary. They're not very aggressive, and you probably need to pay $3 for the nectar to get them to actually land on you, but it's still nice to see the birds up close and personal even if you're not feeding them personally. And overall, there's a very nice variety of animals to see. The spider crabs are FREAKY, and of course, my daughter loves the ""Nemo-fish"".Cons: The children's show is really just a staffer reading a book to the kids, entertaining enough for 5-10 minutes but don't get excited. The Shark exhibit is just one tank that isn't very big. And avoid the single elevator outside if you can, since there are three floors being serviced by a single box and seemingly everyone and their grandparents are trying to use it at the same time.We've only ever been on the weekends, so I haven't seen the supposed school crowds. The place is never super-super busy, so apart from that back elevator it's never been too difficult to get a good view of anything. The shows do fill up fast, so get there early if you want a good spot.All in all, it's a pleasant enough place: clean, modern, and with enough staff to keep things running smoothly. To make it a complete day, I'd also recommend walking out to the lighthouse where you've got some nice views of the harbor and the Queen Mary across the way.",DrHickenlocher
50,Love it!!!,The large tanks full of fish are just mesmerizing!!! Only downside is all the school kids that are there on field trips!,JacarandaSpirit
40,The aquarium is GREAT but don't waste your time on the Behind The Scenes Tour,This aquarium is great!! Exhibits are beautiful and for all ages to enjoy. Do not waste yoru time on the Behind the Scenes tour. We were EXTREMELY disappointed in it. All we basically did was walk in the hallways behind the exhibits and see some old dirty fishtanks with algee in them and a few brine shrimp. It was such a waste of money. When it was over we though we were just moving on to another section of the aquarium and then they told us it was over. So so very disappointed. The aquarium is beautiful and well laid out. If you want to be able to see the exhibits and not get a head ache from all the yelling you need to go after 2:00 pm because then all the school kids are gone. We made the mistake of going at 10:00 on a Tuesday and it was FILLED with school kids that are all shoving to get to the front of the exhibit and yelling and screaming. We noticed that all of a sudden it was quiet about 2:30 and realized that they must have to all get back to school so they had all left.,RonlynnP
50,"Love this place! All the sea life in one place, close to home!","I love going to the Aquarium of the Pacific - that's why I'm a Charter member. This aquarium has so many options for school children on a trip to visiting family from out of the area. There are places to learn about the history of the sea life as well as those where the visitors can touch some of the rays and such. Great exhibits, great interaction between aquarium staff and the public!",MBarnet
50,One of the best....loved it!,"We were completely thrilled with this aquarium. Everything is so well done. Plenty of room to move around and you do not feel crowded like some aquariums. The volunteers do such a great job taking time to interact with the kids. My daughter loved the chance to touch and learn about the jellyfish...first time we had ever done that!We could have watched the otters all day, or sat out with the sea lions and seals.My daughter is 6 and loves a good scavenger hunt...and loved looking for the stampers/embossers throughout the aquarium to stamp her visitor guide. It then makes for a great souvenir.Ample parking in the garage across the street. Right next to the boats if you do the whale or harbor cruise. We did the whale cruise and saw plenty of gray whales. Very neat experience!The food cafe does have a great selection of food and snacks too.....and be warned of the large gift shop!!Highly recommend...and cannot wait to return!",WeThreeAdventurers
40,"Actually June 14th, 2010","Spent a good portion of the day gazing at the puffins and the open aviary, with hand tame parrots landing on our shoulders and arms looking for some chow. It was amazing!A truly delightful experience. A happy day, until the school bus rear ended us on the way back to the resort, where we were staying. The next few days in California spent seeking medical treatment for injuries sustained. This accident had nothing to do with The Pacific Aquarium.",LisaHershner
50,"I hate fish, but I love this aquarium.","This is a beautiful facility overflowing with cool sea creatures. (And I pretty much hate sea creatures, so if *I* like it, that's saying something!) Don't miss the Leafy Seadragon!",katerz
30,"Nice attraction, a little pricey","I went to the aquarium with two children- one in middle school and one in high school. It was fun to see the tanks. Each area was of a different underwater ecology and geographical region. Petting the sharks was a popular activity, but it was very expensive for a family of four.",labonnevie
50,Worth the trip.,They have done a excellent job at this aquarium; the variety of fish is tremendous. Very educational for children and adults alike.,JAMROX69CA
50,Awesome experience,A must go place to visit. Very informative and fun for all ages.,Nissa88
40,Fun for all Ages,"The Aquarium is such a great time to go and see and learn about all sorts of ocean critters. Most of the exhibits are well done and realistic, and the touch opportunities abound. The lorikeets and the ray pool are still so much fun to experience that the $3 for almost no nectar at all in the lorikeet aviary is almost painless.We are when we were done outside the aquarium. Rainbow harbor just outside has so many different restaurants that it really is not worth it to buy even snacks inside the aquarium. Save some money and get what you want just outside the door.",Dustin E
50,Great place for kids,Took my 3 year old on a cold day and we spent hours at the aquarium. tons to get his short attention span. the bird exhibit outside though was a big hit and the petting the sharks was fun as well. a must see in Long Beach if you have kids.,701LongBeach

50,"Great place, especially for kids","We visited the aquarium as part of a relaxing break day from Disneyland. Combining the aquarium in the morning with beach time (Newport Beach to the south) was rejuvenating. There are very nice displays or all kinds of marine life, and for the kids some areas where they can pet sharks, rays, crabs, and other denizens of the deep. There is also a lorikeet (a small parrot) caged area where you can buy little cups of food and the birds will come sit on you had to eat. The two grandkids enjoyed it a lot.",freetogoConnecticut
40,Fun and educational,"More educational than a lot a aquariums, expensive but you can find coupons if you look around. Hard to find if you are not familiar with the area.",JaimieP70
20,SUpervision,although the aquarium itself is great... unfortunately there were bus loads of kids on field trips. 1100 kids is what a worker told us. Usually there are 3500. Needless to say... there were kids running around everywhere. No supervision my poor kids had to fight to see a majority of the attractions. it was a shame. you cant blame the teachers there were just too many kids. call ahead and visit when no field trips are scheduled. they told me they get field trips there daily.,Dave K
40,nice way to spend a few hours,"A good size, lots of opportunities for interactions.",bubbles911
50,The best Aquarium I have been to!,"It may not be the biggest Ive been to, but its certainly the best. And probably the cheapest. The kids absolutely loved their day here and want to go again. There is a good variety of animals to see, and its a very 'hands-on' Aquarium so you get to tough many of the species. There are plenty of experts and volunteers to talk to to find out more if you wish too. I thoroughly recommend it!There is a deal on the website to purchase tickets for the Aquarium and the Los Angeles Zoo (also a great day out!) for a special price.",Markybritt
50,Nice aquarium for kids,"Very nice aquarium for kids. As an adult I loved it too, saw many creatures I had not even seen on TV. I love the Long Beach area anyway so its always nice to be in that area.",BrooklyniteLA
50,Tons to see and experience,"Lots to see and experience. Arrived when they opened and took advantage of wandering the halls without a soul in sight. Also a great deal to get the Aquarium + Queen Mary ticket package, a free shuttle runs between them.",LVI56
40,"Fun, entertaining, exciting!","Seeing fish, and watching them swim is ok, but being able to pet a shark or jellyfish is awesome. This is a great family aquarium with a twist, you can touch sharks, jellies, starfish, anemones, rays, skates, crabs, all kinds of awesome creatures! The admission is average, and the floor plan is small, but they pack a huge number of critters into that place. The gift shop was well stocked with various articles of clothing and toys, as well as books and other trinkets. I would definitely go again! Bring the kids, they will love it!",DominickM
50,I loved it!!,It is a great aquarium with plenty to see! They even have exhibits where you can touch the animals! I will definetly go back :),Diduarte06
30,little small,it was a little too small. but cute. could have used a few more shows. it was nice that it was across the habor from the queen mary hotel. there was a bus that would drop you off there.,bjloveshawaii
40,not enough observation room,The shark area did not have enough room to actually see what the associates were doing. Most of the glass for the exhibits were dirty and we were there on off season. But overall was a knowledgeable experience.,theresa s
40,Fun and Educational,"Very family friendly. We visited on a Sunday afternoon and the Aquarium was filled with families with young kids. That made the experience even more enjoyable for us, but may not be for everyone. Fun to see the sea life and great information on conservation and what we can do to help the ocean environment.",Trink
30,Nice to have but ...,...doesn't really compare to other big city aquariums.,PhillyKid
50,Very kid friendly and fun!!,"Took my four old here and we loved this aquarium! They have really balanced fun and education. There was an outdoor play area for kids with waterworks, my child loved it!!! Also for a small fee you can feed the Lorakeets and they will jump right in your hand.. We really enjoyed this Aquarium and will be back!!",Landlockedslc
30,Ok but Could Be Better,We went on a crowded Sunday and once we got over the shock of the $25 admission had a nice time. It's a bit worn but had some interesting exhibits that captured out interest. However I expected it to be larger- it's not huge- and have more outdoor exhibits. We walked along the waterfront which added to the experience.Not the best tourist attraction in the state but not the worst either.,RoyM1336
40,Beautiful exhibits,"Very interesting, beautiful exhibits, very informative guides. I could watch the jellyfish for hours!",Dakini68
40,Fishes swimming thru my head,Some great exhibits and pretty rewarding overall. Not equal to Monterey's but a close enuf second to make it worth a trip. Great for kids.,bernardoOC
40,very nice aquarium,they have a marvelous aviary. the birds walk around you.... lorikeets i think very colorful and pretty...but do not touch them! thats a no no....the other exhibits were really great also and the staff VERY nice.,Rubyella
50,Loved it so much I became a member,My husband and I went to the aquarium and enjoyed it so much we become members. The behind the scenes tour is a must you really get to see the work they are doing and learn how they are taking care of the animals. On the behind the scenes tour you get to feed fish and touch a few of the animals. You also can touch the manta rays and sharks and jelly fish at different stations throughout the regular exhibits. The building is beautiful the animals wonderful love the lorikeet aviary. Loved the sea lions and seals the sharks and artic foxes. If you love animals and want to spend the day in a beautiful setting surrounded by amazing marine life this is a great place. Staff was all super friendly and helpful A great place.,Darin_and_Christi

40,Great wat to spend a day before a cruise,"Overall, its very good with a lot of interesting exhibits. Its not in the top tier of US aquariums, but its close.Wide variety of marine life.Very crowded on a weekend but thats to be expected. We also enjoyed the outdoor exhibits, which were more open than the tanks inside. Sea lions were especially fun and the related show.Recommended if you are in Long Beach though make sure to get the discounted tickets if you can, its a bit pricey.",David M
30,OK but not great.,"This modern aquarium certainly has beautiful attractions, but the exhibits are not well labeled -- when one tries to identify the fish or other marine creature from the caption boards, half the time it won't be there. The exhibits seem more casually put together rather than well organized for learning. Also -- VERY crowded on weekends; you will find it hard to see many exhibits because of all the people jammed up around them.",Decano
40,Great attractions... Too many strollers.,"This is a fun spot to spend the day... The animal displays are well done and the sea critters housed there are very interesting to see. It is set up in geographical locations and viewing is easy as most of the aquarium windows are large enough for lots of people to see at the same time. There is some kind of interesting sea creature in each aquarium. See them all.Some of the outdoor displays are under renovation at the moment, but most of it is easy to navigate. There are 'petting pools' filled with rays and small sharks. You can choose to 'pet' them as they swim by. (Or not.) Definitely visit the lorikeets! They're beautiful and active birds, very fun to watch. Inside, you can touch jelly fish.There is a water play area for kids, not too big, but enough for everyone to get a little wet.The cafeteria has improved since the first opened, if a little pricy. I had a grilled cheese sandwich which was fine.It gets very crowded, especially on weekends. It's not the fault of the venue, but it's difficult for folks with very little ones using strollers to get around the crowds, and it's difficult for the crowds to get around the folks with strollers. But if you're patient, you'll get to see everything. Children don't always wait their turn. But I guess that was true of us when we were young too.",traylee8
50,Great Long Beach Attraction,"Although this aquarium isn't huge, it has beautiful exhibits and is set up very nicely, with both indoor and outdoor attractions.

50,Fun filled day here.,"We visited Aquarium of the Pacific this weekend with my 9 yr. old niece, 6 yr. old nephew and my 21 month old son. Since I got the tickets for free from my work, I was not expecting much from this place at all. I figured we'd stay here for about an hour or two tops. But I was pleasantly surprised. Truly, time flies so fast when you're having fun; we were there all afternoon! Had I known how much fun this place was for the kids, I would have brought them there earlier so they have all day or more time to linger and explore. The Aquarium is located within downtown Long Beach and by the pier. So there's really lots to see and do here and the vicinity. You can have your hand stamped for re-entry.My 21 month old son had a grand time. He was awed by all the many colors and shapes of different creatures. He laughed when I dipped his hand in the water (but says ""nooo"" when the sharks, bat ray and etc gets close, lol). The playground with a boat and the ""let it rain"" area was pretty fun for the boys as well. My son cried when we had to move on. Had it been summer time, it would have been okay for him to get wet. Even I think the rain showers was pretty cool. When I ask everyone in our party what's their favorite part of the day, it's unanimous, our favorite was the time spent in the Lorikeet Forest. The children love feeding the birds with nectar juice. They get excited when the birds lands on them. Watch out for bird pees! they just squirt pee all over the place - no shame! I'd say, too much nectar juice! lolAnother PLUS is the amount of staff they have all over the park. Every where you turn, there's someone in uniform; approachable and ready to help. Their staffs are also very knowledgeable. Put my animal knowlege to shame! When I asked them simple questions like ""What's that fish called?"", they just don't give you a one word answer, they add an interesting facts to it. Really, fun... even for adults like me!This place is definitely a good place to introduce my 21 month old to sea creatures and birds. They actually have a good selection of different species. This place is just the right size for my lil son. It's not overwhelming or over crowded. An interesting outing, for sure.",Thor G
50,Great Aquarium,Fun for the entire family. Exhibts are well set up for many hands on experiences. Especially enjoy the ray exhibt. I have visited many times.,RB_GF_Girl
40,Lots to see,Enjoyed all the exhibits and everything is very well maintaned,hulalulatravels
40,This isn't a picture of the Aquarium,This is a picture of the Long Beach Sports Arena.,Danikalifornia
40,Always enjoyable. Great for kids.,"We are members of the aquarium which means we have an annual pass and we have been for around 4 or 5 years. They do update the exhibits so there are often new things to see on the first floor near the entrance. They have a added jelly fish touch tank which is so very cool. You can touch different sharks, anemones, urchins, starfish and other animals. They also have the lorikeet forrest so you can feed these small birds which is fun. My daughter is seven and loves to go there over and over. They have sea lions, sea otters, puffins, sharks and loads of fish. The best time to visit is first thing in the morning when they open at 9AM. You will likely be done by noon and since you have already paid for parking, you can easily walk to visit the many restaurants that are nearby. There is a red bus called Passport that will take you to different spots in Long Beach and I believe it is free. They do have some food that can be purchased there but it is not cheap as is usual for most amusement parks. You can get your hand stamped, and eat lunch outside if you brought your own lunch. You can bring snacks for the kids to eat inside. I have never had a problem",jkkm0606
50,So cool!,"Took our kids, 2 and 4 years old here. We didn't know they'd like it so much, we stayed about 6 hours ooooohing and aaahing at all the fish. Such a hit with our kids!!",luvinarlington
50,What a fantastic Aquarium.,"Not only can you see thousands of fish and marine animals, but you can actually touch jellies, sharks, and rays. The knowledgeable staff will tell you all about the creatures you are seeing. Plan on several hours to see it all. An unforgetable experience.",Joan465
50,We love the Aquarium!,The Aquarium is absolutely wonderful! Every time we come here we have a great time and learn something new. The staff is great about answering questions and educating kids on all the different animals and fish. We homeschool and we attended a field trip where the kids dissected a squid--incredible experience. This is a wonderful place to bring your children!,diamondgirl125
50,Awesome aquarium,We spent almost all day there. No one knew there were so many different colored fish in the ocean. I recommend this to everyone.,grandmaDover_AR
40,"Great fun, it's just ALL about how you plan your day!!!","My husband and I enjoyed the aquarium during his Christmas break. It was very busy but still very enjoyable. I would HIGHLY advise the following to make the most out of your trip.*Do not spend your time looking at all the aquariums at once!!! After awhile you start to just speed by and not care as much because they all look the same. RATHER break them up. The aquarium has a first floor and second floor. I would recommend going to see half the aquariums, then taking a break and going outside to the tidepools (this gives your eyes a break) and then after that either go see one of the movies and then go back inside to see the other set of aquariums. We did NOT do this and first went outside. By the time we saw the first floor and second floor aquariums I was tired of looking at the aquariums and just breezed by many of them.",sassystar
50,Wonderful sea life!,"Note: this picture is not of the Aquarium, but of the Sports Arena. The Aquarium is a marvelous exhibit of a number of locations, including Pilau. The exhibits are well done, the animals well cared for, and very educational. Learn which sharks you can touch and which you can't, watch them feed sea otters, and learn about sustainable seafood. The behind the scenes tour is really interesting. Join the Aquarium as a member, and visit anytime.",ladysailor715
50,Best acquarium anywhere,The exhibits inclduing the outoor touch tanks make this one of the best acquariums in the world. Entrance fee is a little pricey but look for coupons and discounts. Whale watching trips are fun too.,WMC08
50,Exhibits theme the Pacific Ocean,"The photo shown is actlally part of the Long Beach Convention Center's Sports Arena which is good for seeing The Long Beach Pop's Symphony Orchestra perform Bugs Bunny on Broadway!!!! ... The Aquarium of the Pacific has exhibits located upstairs, downstairs, inside and out which characterize different locations in the Pacific Ocean's Northern and Southern Hemispheres.",UnionSparky
50,Fun at any age,"I love that they modeled their main tank after Blue Caverns in Catalina. It's beautiful and fun when the divers get in the tank and talk to you. There's lots to see and touch. I go with my husband, my nieces, my mom, anyone who's in town on a visit. Be sure to feed the Lorekeets.",Kellie S
50,Do NOT miss the Lorakeets,"This is a great half day adventure for a family. We have a nine year old. It's not too overwhelming so you have plenty of time to relax, see the exhibit and events. The shark tanks, ray-petting zoo, are great, but the lorakeets are NOT TO BE MISSED. It was so fun, we were in there an hour. Great day.",AMKolat
40,We Love Aquariums,Touch tanks were fun. Good value for the money - we used a AAA discount on admission,Janina M
40,Always a fun time at the Aquarium of the Pacific,We love going to the Aquarium of the Pacific! It is always so well laid out and the staff is very knowledgeable and professional. You will always walk away learning something new! Great way to spend the day!,CrownTownKreisers
50,loved it,I liked everything...well laid out and worth the admission.,cat15
40,Aquarium of the Pacific-Long Beach,"Its very nice,with a good variety of fish if you are into this type of attraction. I would rate it better than the Aquarium in Monterray but not as good as the one in San Diego. Children really enjoy it. Its rather expensive way to spend a few hrs.",anodynemed
40,Aquarium interesting,"I go here every year and really enjoy the aquarium. This time we got to watch a baby shark being born - very interesting. Only problem with this visit was the mutliple schools that were visiting on the same day making it next to impossible to get to see a lot of the main attractions. Having said that, the staff were very accommodating and gave us complimentary passes to come another day when schools wouldn't be visiting. I'd highly recommend a visit, but check for school tours first.",CRM433
50,Best in Southern California,"Exhibits are beautifully staged, and there are hands on things for younger children. Many docents to contribute to your all round experience.",Tina455
50,Interesting and educational,"We visited the aquarium in October when it was reasonably quiet, which allowed us to really look properly at all the fantastic exhibits and not rush around or stand in any queues. The staff were very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful - well worth a visit if you're in the Long Beach area.",Timbob23
30,Not as fun as it used to be,"We have made this aquarium a yearly thing for my family for many years. Although it is still facinating to see all the sea life, it has basically turned into a major environmental propaganda enterprise. My daughter was seriously nervous about us driving back home to Vegas because our car was going to destroy the tropical coral reefs. I understand the need for conservation but they have way overblown it now. If you can get past the, ""we are destroying all this beautiful stuff you are looking at,' mantra you may still enjoy yourself. We are probably done though...",tconk40554
50,Really well done. Good value for the money.,Plan on about 2 hours. Really enjoyed the presentation of information and marine life. A nice way to spend a couple of hours. And close to a lot of great places to eat and see.Easy to get to on the Long Beach Transit system. ( little red bus ) .Would recommend this for families and adults.,rocketman000
50,Excellent,"Lots for kids to see and do. The huge tanks of fish are beautiful and mesmerising, and the highlight of our trip was being able to stroke live sharks.... yes, really! Great selection of restaurants nearby, and a good giftshop with plenty of souvenirs at pocket money prices. Go there, you won't be disappointed...",fiddlewifey
40,Exceptionally child friendly,"This is the most child friendly of the aquariums I have visited, with more than the usual number of ""touchable"" exhibits. If your child is adventurous, and wants to pet a shark, for example, this is the place to take him or her. While it doesn't seem to have much to do with an aquarium, there are a large number of colorful lorikeets in a walk through aviary, whose antics will delight both adults and children. Also, if you are planning a whale watching visit while in the area, there is a life size blue whale model along with educational information that will help you better understand what you are seeing when you see the whales. Since you only see a small part of the live whale at a time, I feel like the model helps put what you are viewing into perspective. I would recommend visiting the aquarium first, and then doing your whale watching trip.",PhotogFun
50,Amazing aquarium!,"We visited the aquarium on a Thursday in October and it was wonderful! There were knowledgeable staff at each exhibit explaining interesting facts. Interactive exhibits to touch jellies, anemones, hermit crabs, sharks, and rays were awesome! The sea otters were fun to watch and we even got to feed the lorikeets (food is an additional charge, but totally worth it).There were some school groups there but it was ok as they moved through pretty quickly. I anticipated an hour or 2 here, but we ended up staying for about 3-1/2 hours!This was such an enjoyable experience for my family and I'd recommend this place as a nice break in between visits to Disneyland (short drive from Anaheim). Would definitely visit here again!",Nic N
50,Great for the little ones!,"My 2 year old little girl adored this place! Lots of things to see, touch, and explore. Will come again next year!!",emma e
50,This place rocks!,"Spent the good part of the day here. It was way better than I thought it would be. It is a very ""hands on"" place. Got to touch sharks, stingrays, and more. The exhibits are done really well. One exhibit looks like the waves are coming in - always in movement. The staff is excellent and very helpful. This place is not to be missed!",chuck807
40,Fun Day,"We went to the Aquarium as a part of a weekend getaway to Long Beach. The Aquarium was a blast. After having gone to La Jolla Aquarium and to Sea World so many times, I was worried about what to expect.It was an amazing time. It had a bit of everything, including petting sting rays, which is always a favorite of mine. It is an indoor and outdoor location, which gives you the best of both worlds. It is also a great opportunity to take some amazing photos.",alykeany
50,A great aquarium!,"I had heard the aquarium was very good so made sure to take a day to visit while in the Long Beach area. It was excellent with a wide variety of indoor and outdoor attractions and displays. The exhibits ranged from very small species-specific tanks to large, multi-species tanks.I especially enjoyed the wide range of jellyfish exhibits, as well as the outdoor shark and ray exhibit. The massive reticulated whiptail ray dwarfed the sharks swimming over her. I loved the South Pacific and Northern Pacific exhibits as well.",mdfloyd322
50,Awesome Place,Well worth a visit. My sister and I took my 12-ye-old nephew and he enjoyed it. Huge multi-story tanks with exhibits to attract a variety of interests and ages. Explore everything from tidepools where you can touch critters to the shark feeding tank. Sea lions and seals play in an exhibit that goes under the walkway so they play around you. There's even a bird aviary. Rude stroller people blocking exhibits a hassle but what are you going to do at family friendly places. Easy parking in the garage.After we at Buba Gump's Seafood across the street and it was pretty good for a chain plus fun and relaxed.,westwomanaz
40,Very nice aquarium- love this place,"I use to live in CA and had a yearly membership to this place. I really enjoy this aquarium. It is fairly small so plan on seeing everything in about 2 hours. They do have a nice touch tank outdoors to touch stingrays (with their barbs removed). My wife loves the touch tank so I am sure kids will get a real kick out of this feature. The aquarium is located on the water in long beach with views of the ocean as well as the Queen Mary ship across the bay. Plenty of food places nearby within walking distance as well. Parking is a multi level parking structure that is used for the shops, restuarants and the aquarium. There is a fee to park (I think it was 6.00). They do offer a discount for AAA members as well as Police and Military with proper ID.",ElitePhx
40,Really great aquarium - we were able to touch so many animals!,"Loved the ability to touch the sharks, sting rays and.... wait for it...Jellyfish. Never had we had the chance to do that and we have been to aquariums on both coasts. Also saw the LARGEST crab we have ever seen. It's a nice sized museum. You can probably see most of it in 2.5 hours. Great indoor and outdoor options. Not too crowded. You can learn and enjoy while still being in a relaxed environment. Great location. Super close to the Long Beach Marina where we rented bikes. Enjoy.",enjoyingtheview
50,Never disappointing!,"I love this aquarium. It's clean and exciting...they have sea horses, amazing coral, shark and sting ray petting on the roof, and other glorious oceanic things. During the summer, admission is half off on Sunday evenings. Love it.",osbornclaire
20,Underwhelmed...,"Ok... So I heard about this place for years and years... Finally mae it here. Not at all what I was expecting!!!! It sucked. I hate to be blunt... I guess it's good if you are 4 or 5 years old... But there was way too much educational exhibits... Which is cool if youbare with kids... But I wanted to see cool sea animals. I have been to the Baltimore aqaurium, the ones on Hawaii, all over. This one in Long Beach has a good reputation... But it did not live up to the rep. Seriously, skip it. I actually was pissed that we paid 25 bucks to get in. Best part was a spontaneous play time with seals that surprised everyone. Btw - if you eat at the Gladstones restaurant by the harbor (which is amazing and has great views) you can get free passes to the Aqaurium. I really don't want to be hard on the place... But it ws WAY over-rated.",phxtravelguy
50,Excellent Aquarium,We went to the aquarium on one of their discount nights. It is a really nice location and a great place to go a few hour with the family.,travelbatty
30,Meh...,"We drove to Long Beach specifically to see the Aquarium. Believe it or not, the Newport Aqarium here in KY is larger and more interesting than this one. I was disappointed in the size and variety of displays. Very ordinary. I suppose that if you haven’t been to many, this may be a nice experience, but if you’ve been to other aquariums, I believe this one will be disappointing.",peekacho_2000
50,"The Long Beach Aquarium is superb, offering something for everyone.","From indepth information on marine life to behind the scenes marine veterinary medicine to otters to a splash playground to spectacular display tanks, this aquarium is wonderful. A great place to spend a couple hours or all day. A membership costs only a bit more than one day's admission. Best to go either on a summer weekday (first thing or in the afternoon) or anytime in the fall, winter, or spring. Cafeteria food is okay.",leyore
50,AMAZING - I will go back!!,"I cannot believe I haven't been to this amazing venue before now.... the size is compact - perfect for families with young kids. I would recommend not going on a weekend and when you do go, go early in the day. Parking is across the street and is only $8.00. BUT, you can spend the entire day walking around Shoreline Village. I would much rather go to the Aquarium of the Pacific than Seaworld - much more educational, less expensive and the volunteers are very knowledgable. The best part is that there are many hands-on exhibits where you can touch the sea life. It is a MUST SEE! TIP: Look for coupons (Baskin/Robbins has them) or use your AAA card. The gift shop has an amazing selection of books.",Blnaq
40,Great with the whale watch,"The aquarium is small & doesnt compare to a New York or Washington type but for the space they have they made great use of it. In combination with the whale watching cruise this was a great day! The aquarium is relatively small and I would not pay the price alone as the only big animals they have are a few sea lions and seals.On the bright side, the tours are exreemely educational & my six year old nephew quoted many of the facts he learned at the aquarium throughout the remainder of our trip. A great feature this aquarium has that I havent seen elsewhere were the embossing stamps in the guidebook. Kids are given a guidebook and told to look in that particular gallery for the embossing stamp which routes them through the variaty of aquatic life the aquarium has to offer.This aquarium also has volunTEENS who have special projects set up throughout the aquarium providing education on how vets care for animals, to size of shark teeth, to water conservation.We started at 10:30 & got through the aquarium by 1:30pm, having stamped all the applicable pages of the guide book. This allowed us to bounce across the street to the malls food court and grab a reasonably priced bite before hoping the 3pm whale watching cruise. We found sea lions, a large school of dolphins and 7 blue whales.... The kids were very happy to have such wonderful views of such large aquatic animals. ( I recommend bringing dramamine for the kids as the boat can get rocky)Upon return we ate at chilis right by the harbor & were back at the hotel by 8:30pm.. After showers the kids passed right out... Overall it was a wonderful family execursion",patientv1976
40,I dare you to touch a shark!,"Lots of hands in tanks w/ sting rays, star fish, and even sharks. Our daughters were fascinated and scared to dip their fingers in. We loved the tunnels with the seals swimming under water. Disliked the lack of shade outside while looking at the tanks. We spent a few hours walking through the entire aquarium. Our kids are 2 & 4, and we had no need for strollers. Also, there are lots of restaurants just outside the aquarium, and a Coldstone ice cream shop. Lots of fun.",planetrainauto99
20,There are much better around than this!,"Aquarium of the Pacific is ok, but there are SOOOO many better aquariums. I really expected one in such a large metro area to be much better. All animals are great to learn about and see, but there's way too many small tanks, skinny hallways, and bad audio. The small tanks fit two or three onlookers, the skinny hallways cannot accomodate the number of folks that they allow in especially because a good 1/2 of the folks have strollers. The audio was so bad in some areas that you really couldn't make out what the ""host' was saying about the seals, or divers, etc. The biggest thing there is their store. So I guess that tells you were their priority is. Go to San Diego for a kind of close-by much better experience. Go to Monteray for a slightly further away but MUCH better experience.",Nigel1127
50,Really Surprised - Excellent Aquarium,"My wife and I visited the aquarium on Saturday and I was really surprised. I have been to aquariums from coast to coast and this is actually one of the best I have been to. This aquarium doesn't get much attention and I was not expecting very much, I was really surprised at what we found. 2 floors and awesome exhibits. The fish were easy to see and identify and the exhibits were clean and in good shape. The animals all looked good and well cared for. We got there about 11:00 and it was busy but not crowded. About 1:00 we left for lunch and when we returned it was very crowded. if not for the oblivious people with strollers it would have been better, but this isn't the aquarium's fault. I really enjoyed the outside shark and ray area and the lorikeets as well as the seals. Some other reviews say this is not as good as other aquariums and it probably isn't, after all, only 1 aquarium can be the ""best"", but this one is great, much better than most others and well worth the $20 admission.",chrisj110
50,One of the BEST Aquariums on the west coast,"Always evolving to provide each guest a WOW experience. Artic foxes, penguins, seals, sea lions, rays, sharks and so much more! Lots of touch labs and exhibits dealing with global warming. The divers and exhibit interpreters do an excellent job taking about the sea animals and how our footprints effects their environments. Hop on the boat and see the whales as the migrate. If you are in the LA area, this is a must see attraction!",Rick&David
30,Nice aquarium but I've seen better,"We were in Long Beach this weekend and decided to go to the Aquarium of the Pacific since my wife had never been to an aquarium. I've never seen this one either so I thought it was a good idea. It was a pretty good sized aquarium with 2 floors. They had a lot of exhibits that my wife enjoyed very much. We especially enjoyed all the animal encounter exhibits (jellyfish, stingrays, small sharks, starfish, etc.) however I'm not sure if the animals enjoyed it very much. We went after 5:00 pm, so we didn't get to see the bird exhibit. We did sneak into to the arctic fox area but the fox was asleep (i think...) and was in a very sad looking cage outside. I was expecting an air-conditioned, indoor exhibit resembling the arctic tundra. Anyways we saw everything in about 2 hours. In my opinion, there are better aquariums out there but this one is nice to see if you haven't been to one yet.Tip: On certain days after 5:00pm you can get in at a discounted price. Check their website for the schedule.",Josue C
50,This is a really great place!,"We decided on a whim to visit The Aquarium of the Pacific and we are so happy that we chose too. It was wonderful! My children were able to pet stingrays, feed birds, and touch a slug (eww!). We will go back whenever in Long Beach. Also the area around this Aquarium looks really neat too...lots of shops and fun food places.",Jends123
30,"OK, kids liked it, parents knew the Atlanta GA is better","My husband and I went to see the Atlanta Aquarium last year; we took the kids to the Aquarium of the Pacific this year. We knew the difference when we walked in. The kids liked the hands on experience but as for the exhibits, Atlanta was so much better. In short, if you haven't seen the Atlanta Georgia Aquarium, you'll like this. If you have been to Atlanta, save your money. I'm happy we had a BOGO coupon; otherwise, I would be very upset. The rating is for the kids, not adults.",AthenaP1
40,"Loads of fun, and educational too.","This is my second time visiting the aquarium and I really enjoy spending time there. They have so many different types of tanks with all sorts of undersea life, some you have seen before and others you have not.Outside the building they have a shark tank, sea lions, otters and some bird wildlife. They also have a Lorikeet forest that you purchase a tiny cup of nectar and these rainbow colored birds flock to you, well worth the it.Getting to the parking is a little confusing if you aren't prepared, it is across the aquarium in a parking structure. They also run a courtesy shuttle from the aquarium to the Queen Mary, that way you don't have to pay for parking twice and they also sell a reduced ticket for both attractions but they have to be used on the same day which is not a problem.",DiabloDeb
20,"Save your money, go to sea world!","Thank goodness we went after hours and paid the discounted night rate for this aquarium. the aquarium is I n need of some TLC and a deep cleaning. So many areas and outside attractions could of used a fresh coat of paint and some elbow grease. We couldn't see into the seal exhibit because the windows were so dirty. The staff was disengaged and unknowledgeable of the exhibits they were working. Our biggest draw to the aquarium was the arctic fox exhibit we had seen all over town. When we called to see I f any exhibits were closed for the night hours they only said the lorikeets would be off exhibit. We searched the entire aquarium for the fox and finally asked an employee where it was....and he said it was closed! Arghhh!!! Come to find out, it is one fox which is outside in a cage....so sad and so disappointing.",disneymama619
30,Small but lots to see,"As some reviews have previously said, the aquarium is on the small side, however we still spent several hours exploring the different exhibits. There were a lot of interactive exhibits as well as a lot of fun shows. The exhibits were very colorful and beautiful, plus there was quite a bit of educational information, for those that are interested.We also did the whale watching boat ride that the aquarium offers. We did not get to see any whales but we did see a lot of dolphins, a seal and another sea creature (I don't remember what it was called but apparently it's prey for sharks). The captain even turned the boat off at one point to see if we could find a shark. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. The boat was VERY rocky and several people in our group got sea sick.",Carolyn S
40,Aquarium of the Pacific is a must see!,My kids and I loved it. There are SO many varieties of sea creatures. The facility is large and open!,RedlandsWeb
50,Very Interactive,"We had a wonderful day at this aquarium. My daughter loved all the things you could touch, from the sharks and stingrays, to the starfish and sea urchins. She had a ball feeding the lorikeets ($3 for a cup of nectar). At one time she had two birds on her and I had three on me. She also got to pretend to be a veterinarian at the aquarium, getting an animal and making a diagnosis using clues they provided on the chart. There are lots of places for hands on learning. Docents stand with boxes that you can put your hand in and try to guess what you're feeling. There were also docents who helped the children put on a little play. It was a very fun way to spend a day.The location is right on the water and my daughter also enjoyed walking around and looking at the boats. We also loved walking up to the lighthouse and looking at the Queen Mary across the harbor. Beautiful location!The only drawback is that you have to pay to park ($8), and there are no in and out privileges, so once you go in, you are stuck. The food at the aquarium was quite expensive, and it was very crowded, so we walked to Chili's and got lunch.",Go2theZoo
40,You can pet sharks and sting rays here!,"The aquarium is ok, nothing super spectacular. There is free public transit to there and other Long Beach attractions.What really makes this place stand out is that there are shark and sting ray petting areas! You can really just stick you hands in the water and pet those guys. It was adorable. We purchased a combo admission ticket for the aquarium and the Ghosts and Legends Tour at the Queen Mary for $36, and we felt it was worth it.",Liz P
50,Wonderful seaside attraction,"While some people may overlook this attraction, I found it very entertaining and relaxing. The staff was very friendly upon entering the aquarium entrance. I enjoyed viewing the many exhibits and was told they are always changing. There is upstairs and downstairs exhibits, also outdoors for the shark laggoon and the petting of sharks and baby rays. Who knew you could pet sharks? I was amazed at how big the aquarium is once inside. Picked up a few nice gifts on my way out. They have a nice selection of books on sealife, postcards, stuffed animals and kechains. There was a cafe as well but did not utilize this.",LBConcierge
50,The sea otters are worth the admission alone,"We had arrived in LA only 12 hours (after being in transit from Australia for 30+hours) before so this was a great way to spend a relaxing Friday in California.Its in a great part of Long Beach, lots to see and do. A really nice clean place. Parking was easy to find (at a price BUT still cheaper than here in Western Australia!), lovely statues & foreshore all around. Fabulous architecture all around, including the aquarium.Our first (but not last) glimpse of the gorgeous Californian Sea Otters.......just adorable.A great place for the entire family, great for all ages.PSWe avoided the Lorikeets as we have them at home so not exciting for us",jhoppy01
50,"""Touching"" experience","My husband and I loved the Aquarium of the Pacific. It was way more than I expected. We enjoyed the seal/sea lion show and the sea otter show and spoke at length with the presenter about her experience while she answered our questions. The facility offers many hands-on exhibits including a tank full of manta rays that literally come to the edge to be touched. It was a remarkable experience. We spent hours viewing all the tanks and exhibits, ate hotdogs and fries in the little patio stand and watched a short movie in the theater. One suggestion: GO EARLY, especially on the weekends. It got crowded as the day wore on which made viewing difficult.",AvenueBee
40,Great aquarium for kids,Went to visit here cause my daughter really liked the lorikeet forest the last time she was there. It was a really cute aquarium perfect for kids. It wasn't too crowded. My daughter who is 8 and my son who is 2 both loved it. The lorikeet forest is a lot of fun for them since the birds will often climb on you. They are very pretty as well. They both like the shark and ray touch pools and the tidepool touch pool. My only complaint was there was only one sink area for all these displays. My son also really liked watching all the colorful tropical fish.,Ltzz
50,Great aquarium in LA,"The Aquarium of the Pacific was a great find on a recent weekend visit to the LA from San Diego. It exceeded my expectations. I am a marine scientist, avid diver and truly enjoyed my visit. I love sharks and they had plenty here on display. The tank that represents the Blue Corner in Palau is a decent replica and a highlight as I have actually been diving there. Impressed. Informative, great tanks, and plenty of exhibits to keep you interested for 2-3 hours. Right up there with Monterey Bay. Highly recommend a visit here if you want to experience the ocean without getting wet! Will return again myself.",Kauff_210
40,"Fun and, please forgive me, delicious!","I've been wanting to get to the Aquarium of the Pacific for nearly a decade - ever since the Albert Brooks movie, The Muse, showed a scene at the site. Sadly, the aquarium is not nearly as impressive as it looks on screen (perhaps in this case, the camera does not really add ten pounds?), but it was still great fun.There is great variety in the exhibits - both in the types or marine life featured and the presentation of the fish - and plenty to capture the attention of both children and adults. There were interactive areas where you could touch the marine life (starfish, sea anenomies, stingrays, etc.) and educational exhibits to learn more about the importance of conservation. My favorite area was the Baja Gallery with its three story high aquarium, but my kids loved the sea otter area the best.I got a bit silly when looking at the pacific lobster tanks (I selected the one that I would prefer for my meal), and maybe it was because we were there at lunchtime, but I realized we had to go when I started thinking that the inhabitants of the tanks looked delicious. Fortunately, there were some great dining options, both in the aquarium and at nearby restaurants.Going to the Aquarium of the Pacific was a fun family outing, and we will go there again!",BostonSummerGirl
40,Interesting Exhibits and Earth Friendly Information - Good Side Trip to the Dog Shows,"This is an easy venue to tour through and I found the employees and volunteers to be really helpful. I went on a weekday afternoon when the boat to Catalina was full at a reasonable ticket price. I was able to use my AAA card for a discount so I paid about $20 to get in. Regular adult price was about $25.The exhibits were well maintained and I lucked out to be right next to a man that was touring the exhibits with his friends and he was a great docent.I liked this as a side trip to other activities, but wouldn't go out of my way to see just the Aquarium.Lorikeet exhibit is nice, but they will dive bomb you for food and be prepared to have lots of birds land on you.",RileyRants
50,"A fantastic, interactive marine experience!""","We chose to visit Aquarium of Pacific on our last day of a family trip to Disneyland. It was superb and we were impressed with the exhibits. Luckily, we arrived just after noon when all of the school tours were clearing out. I would recommend visiting on a weekday afternoon. We didn't find it crowded at all. My five year old son was thrilled with all of the touching pools. Not every day that kids can pet sharks, rays, starfish and more. He was so excited to feed the lorikeet birds nectar too. This is a wonderful facility; very glad we came. My only regret is that we didn't leave more time to explore the nearby pier shops and restaurants the waterfront area has to offer.",cdnma
40,Shark touching was the highlight!,"My Kids loved the shark tanks, they couldn't believe that they were able to actually touch a shark! I loved the Tropical Tank show where a scuba diver went into the tank in front of us, swimming with the sea turtle, sharks etc! The staff were very nice and the facility was very clean. It is a bit pricey but if you buy your tickets online ahead of time, you can save $5 per adult at least.",zeebee_10
40,Nice Aquarium and Petting Areas!,"We decided to visit the aquarium with our Go Los Angeles card after touring the Queen Mary. It was already about 3:30 in the afternoon when we got to the aquarium, and we didn't want to stay too long since we had a 6 hour drive back to Phoenix afterwards. It was perfect timing though, and there weren't really any crowds and we got there just in time for the sea otter presentation. We saw most of the aquarium in the hour and a half that we spent there. We spent quite a bit of time at the touch pools and got to ""pet"" sting rays, sharks, a sea cucumber, and a sea urchin. I would recommend the aquarium if you want to see sea lions, sea otters, and pet some sealife that otherwise you would not be able to do.",pilotgirl21
40,Love Love Love the SEA OTTERS,"We went this past week (on a Thursday). My toddler LOVED it.If you are going on a weekday do not go before noon...too many school kids. Your child will have to maneuver his way to see things. After lunch it was nicer...kids were all gone and I was able to let my child just walk up to the exhibits with no problems.We brought lunch with us and ate outside in the Sea Lion Exhibit. Bring extra clothes for your kids cause there is a water play area and the kids are sure to get wet.Parking is $8WAYS TO SAVE:Most Fridays they have FREE entrance to Shark Lagoon from 6pm - 9pm. You go through a side entrance and you have access to the outside area and see the shark tank with live music. I wouldn't drive to do this (or pay for parking), but if I was already in the area I definitely would.GOLDSTAR has tickets for $15.50 for Adult, $9 per child to visit from 3pm - 6pm (perfect time) http://www.goldstar.com/events/long-beach-ca/aquarium-of-the-pacific.htmlREADY SET GROW LA has coupons you can print out....save $6 Adult $2 Child http://www.readysetgrowla.org/coupons-partners/images/aquarium-of-the-pacific.jpgVISIT LONG BEACH has coupons you can print out...save $3 Adult $1.50 per Child http://www.visitlongbeach.com/coupons/index.cfm?action=showCoupon&couponID=252socalpocketmemories.blogspot",socalpcktmemories
50,Who needs a submarine?,Well worth the money. So many different types of underwater wildlife to see. Great for taking children.,scoutXL
40,Short and sweet,"I just brought my 4th grade class on a field trip here during a weekday. It was perfect, with just enough exhibits to keep us occupied and not overwhelmed. The students enjoyed touching sharks, stingrays, and anemones in the interactive areas. The sea lion and seal show was small, but fun as well!",jchen86
40,Great aqaurium!,"This is a great place to go with or without kids. It's right on the water, so you can go whale watching or boating before or after wards. The Octopus and jellyfish exhibits were great. The sea lion show was great too. We loved petting the sharks and sting rays.",bigfloppy
40,Smaller than we thought,"It was smaller than we expected, but the touch pools were very nice and the exhibits were great. Most of it is inside which is nice to get away from the rays of the sun for a while. The staff was friendly. The aquarium has this amazing giant exhibit with the biggest fish I have ever seen, the glass wall is from floor to ceiling (about 15 feet). Plus once you're done with the aquarium the surrounding area is great. You can see the Queen Mary across the river, the vendors and habor tours are great. Really a nice time.",Inlove621
40,Great but CROWDED,"We had a very good time at the aquarium but you have to fight your way through masses of people just to see the animals. It is pretty big for an aquarium and it seems like the animals are well cared for, but man, the crowds. We went on a Sunday(which was probably dumb) so if you can go during the week, that is a better idea.",dodg1988
40,"Well designed, fascinating venue to learn about life in the Pacific","What other reviewers have said about crowding is true and the best time to visit this museum is after school groups leave (perhaps 1:30). Summer nights, the Aquarium often stays open late. Parking at the nearby garage is convenient though it can get crowded. However, once parked you also have access to the boardwalk and several fine or fun restaurants. The location is lovely.The museum is cleverly designed with 3 main sections highlighting areas of the Pacific. My favorite, and the most colorful, is the Tropical Pacific. Don't just glance at the larger tanks, 9and these are wonderful for seeing interaction and environment), but take in the smaller displays with tiny sea horses, shark eggs hatching, and sea jellies that seem to be pulsating with electricity. Outside one can watch sharks, feed the lorikeets, or stroke sting rays. The otters in the newest exhibit are adorable to watch as are birds in the North Pacific section. Whatever you do, don't miss the leafy sea dragons.",Wendy M
40,Very Nice,"Really enjoyed our visit here. It took us about 4 hours to tour the entire thing, but that was with stopping frequently to take photos. The exhibits are well maintained and there's a good selection of aquatic animals. I would've liked to see more cephalopods (they had only one octopus, and no squid IIRC). They don't have manatees, great whites, belugas or the like. They have lovely jelly exhibits and a very fun seal exhibit.On the day we were there, 1300 children were coming through on field trips (this according to a volunteer in the lorikeet enclosure). It was VERY crowded with loud kids (and louder parents), but they were mostly gone by noon.",CorkNut
20,Not worth the admission cost,"Took me about an hour to see the entire aquarium, exhibits were small and not all that great, and I've seen a better selection of fish to view at local aquarium stores then this aquarium has.For the money its simply not worth the cost to go to this aquarium. There are better aquariums out there and best to save your money for those aquariums.If you do go, make sure to go after 1-2pm when the school groups leave.",jsmith11618
40,An Enjoyable Afternoon,"As part of our Queen Mary Package, my husband and I received two tickets to the Aquarium of the Pacific. We parked in the adjacent parking garage, which will honor a lower rate with aquarium ticket stub.As mentioned in earlier reviews, the best time for those without children would be after 2:00 in the afternoon. The aquarium was teeming with more children than fish! :o) It was very easy to become separated from my husband by a band of excited children on a field trip. The minor inconvenience was outweighed by the children's obvious excitement. We tried to remind ourselves of this fact every time a little one shoved past us to the glass or jumped excitedly into our picture...lolThe highlight of the day was a visit to the Lorikeet Forest. For a fee ($3) you can purchase a small cup of nectar for the birds, who will literally land on you two, three at a time to drink from your hand! If you are taking small children, spare them the heartache...buy them some nectar so the birds will come to them. It was so sad to see little ones not truly enjoying the experience because the birds would not come to them without the little cup of nectar. I tried sharing with a little girl, but the birds would have nothing to do with it. Spend the 3 bucks and make your kid's day.... I can't wait to take my grandchildren to the Lorikeet Forest.The touch pools were adequate as was the sea lion show. Not spectacular. I was disappointed to learn that the Otter exhibit was closed.Other than a few minor inconveniences, we enjoyed the 3 to 4 hours we explored the aquarium. When we were finished, we strolled the boardwalk and ate dinner at Bubba Gumps ...overall, a nice, relaxing way to spend the day.",jimzgrl
40,It's small but still a good acquarium,"The whole self tour is two hours max. but the place is clean, colorful and attractive. If you're going on a weekday, as we did, go after 1 p.m. There were so many noisy little kids on school tours, but once they cleared out it was great. Tickets bought online were $5 cheaper and my 2 teens and I were able to walk to the entrance without waiting in a huge line. Food is expensive so take your drinks and a snack with you or go in after you've already had a meal. Sea lions and seals are always fun, but if you have teens they probably won't be too interested. Mine liked the jellies, sea stars, sharks and hermaphrodite fish.",Monica
50,This place is one of the best aquariums...,"This place is one of the best aquariums in the country! Two level indoors with wonderful galleries showcasing different areas of the Pacific Ocean. Shows include otters, seals and sea lions, divers feeding fish and talking to people outside the exhibits, and shark feeding. There are several touch areas where one can touch sharks, rays and invertebrates. You can feed lorikeets. Every exhibit is wonderful, everywhereis clean and the animals look happy and healthy.Anyone who went through this place in one or two hours missed a lot!",DayCaptain
40,"It isn't the largest aquarium, but it is worth the trip","We have been there a couple of times and enjoy it. They have some good jelly displays, some great Sea Dragons (like Sea Horses, but fancier) and some good-sized sharks. The petting pool has some sharks and rays the kids will love touching. The animals do not avoid being touched at all.",rdeckard
20,Poor Management and Overcrowded,OK aquarium. Harbour Tour was nice. What was inexcusable was the management. Ticket machine was down so we got an old fashioned vise slip that we were tol would get us in everywhere! Not! No one wanted to honor it even with written explanation and signature of cashier. The staff at all places was inefficient and denied us entry. We were not allowed on the boat for the HArbour Cruise and had to puch the issue to be allowed on...last! I was second in line! It was a total overcrowded mess and not worth the price!,DCD2212
40,Shark experience - we got to feed huge sharks!,"This weekend, we visited this aquarium and did the shark experience. (I booked it 3 weeks in advance, as they only offer this on the weekends) It's a little pricey ($90), but it includes admission and 2 hours of personal introduction to sharks. The highlights were feeding and petting, the bamboo sharks, Keith the 8 foot nurse shark and Fern, the 170 lb zebra shark. We were actually in the water with Fern swimmming between us! Once in a lifetime, that's for sure! It was very safe - for both us and the sharks. The staff was enthusiastic about sharing their love of sealife. My kids are 14 and 15 and they now have a more personal appreaciation of sharks..",alice063
20,Okay for kids... I've been to much nicer aquariums,"I have to say that I've been to the Monterey Bay aqwuarium so my rating may be swayed by the fact that that aquarium is FANTASTIC!!! But this aquarium is SMALL. Took us an hour and a half to get through EVRYTHING (and I even took time to take jsut over 400 photographs!) For a 10 year old aquarium everything looked so old and dirty. We were the first ones upstairs on a Saturday morning and the streaks and fingerprints were all over the glass from the day before. The tanks are very poorly lite...and some of them were compeltely dark (and not for a speacial reason either). All of the water was cloudy and merkey with tons of floatys in it making it impossible to see fish near the backs of the tanks. 24 dollars per adult for 1 1/2 hour didn't seem worth it to me. However, all the kids seemed to be enjoying themselves very much and didn't notice any of the dirtyness or merkiness.",hwalker1337
40,"Great place, had lots of fun...just a lil small","Im a big fan of aquariums, and besides going to Sea World, Aquarium of the Pacific was my first aquarium trip. I have to say I was really exited about going, and I guess that was my biggest mistake, I expected alot. I enjoyed the trip, and the only ""bad"" thing I have to say about the aquarium is that its kind off small. I expected at least 3 hours of walking around when in reality it was about 1 and a half to 2 hours. But those two hours were really fun and interesting. I went on a Saturday, so there was a good amount of people, but it was still really fun. The shark tanks are really nice and its ""hand on"" tank is really fun. The price wasnt that bad, and I got to see everything. This is a short afternoon visit with the family or freinds.",TicallionStallion
50,Loved it!,"We booked the aquarium ahead of time after returning from a cruise and our flight was not leaving till 4:15. I am an avid scuba diver and have been to several aquariums throughout the U.S. and due to some of the reviews was not sure if I should visit or not, I will tell you I thought it was excellent. It is just like diving, every place has it's certain things that make it special. I absolutely loved the sea lion exhibit. The shark tank had some impressive larger sharks. I really enjoyed the more exotic smaller creatures like the leafy sea dragon. They had several different kinds of jelly fish tanks along with numerous tropical tanks. Feeding the birds outside was a nice little extra to an aquarium. I only touched on a few of the exhibits, there is much more to see than what I mentioned. We bought our tickets ahead of time online for 5.00 off, so for the price I think it is a definite must see if you have a free day and enjoy sealife. Besides a couple school buses there were few visitors when we were there (on a Monday)",meundrh2oo
30,"OK Aquarium, not great, just OK","Very crowded with people, which is to be expected, but the viewing areas for tanks are small, making the enjoyment of the displays much more difficult. For $10 more we bought tickets for both the aquarium and a 45 minute tour of the harbor. The harbor tour was worth it.",Joandio
50,Fantastic aquarium for the whole family,"This aquarium is both fun and educational. There are a good variety of fish and other animals. The outdoor play area is great for younger kids. You can even feed the birds at the outdoor giant bird ""cage"".",mtnbikeguy
30,Very enjoyable,"I've been to this Aquarium twice and enjoyed both my visits very much. The aquarium is small; however, the exhibits are thoughfully laid out and fun to see. We especially enjoyed the interactive exhibits where you can touch the rays and small sharks, they seem to enjoy being pet. There is also a Lorikeet forest you can enter and if you purchase a little cup of nector the birds will land on your arm to eat.We also paid an extra few dollars and went on a 45 minute harbor tour of Rainbow Harbour, which was very pleasant. The boat takes you out to the breakwater and back stopping briefly to take pictures of sea lions snoozing on any available floating surface!",IncurableAdventurers
50,I loved this aquarium!,"I went on tripadvisor to get reviews of the aquarium, and I felt like most people were really negative about it. We went anyway, and we absolutely LOVED it. As people have pointed out, it's a regular aquarium, not SeaWorld, but as aquariums go I thought it was fantastic. Great close-up opportunities to see sea lions, seals, otters, puffins...not to mention the opportunity to feed lorakeets right out of your hand! I highly recommend this spot if you're in or around Long Beach.",LosAngelesKate1980
30,"Nice Aquarium, but way too crowded","The Aquarium of the Pacific has a lot to offer including several great jellyfish displays, a stingray touch pool, and many species of sharks and rays that you normally don't see at other aquariums. The tanks are well presented and maintained and overall this would be a great aquarium to visit if it weren't for the overwhelming crowds.They sell timed tickets and we got there early (10 a.m.), but it was still really crowded as all the patrons vied for a spot up close to view the tanks. Many visitors were really aggressive in getting up front to see, but if you ever expected to get right up to the tank, you had to stand your ground and make sure that you didn't get pushed back. This does not make for a particularly enjoyable experience, however. The purpose of the timed tickets is supposed to be to control the crowds, but if the aquarium wants to do that, they should consider limiting the number of entrants to about half of whatever it currently is.",Dallas Traveler
40,"Had a great time, Beautiful location, fun show","We went to the aquarium on Friday, July 31, 2009. (me, hubby and 8yr old son)The area is so beautiful.It took us about 2 1/2 hours to see everything at the aquarium, including one show we sat in on. ( It was a harbour seal and sea lion show. )I thought that each exhibit was beautiful and very well thought out. Both the visual display and the replication of the specific fish's typical habitat and surroundings were very pretty and thorough.There are two floors inside the aquarium, and an outdoor area as well.There is a restaurant on the premises and a snack shack area, also reasonably priced souvenir shopping on site.Outside of the aquarium there are several restauarants to choose from as well.We spent some time walking around the boardwalk and pier after going through the aquarium.Oh...we found $3.00 discount coupons in an ""Orange County - things to do"" magazine that was in our hotel room. Also...I think you can get a cheaper admission if you buy your tickets online prior to going.Regular price was $23.95 adults and $11.95 children",imjdubs
20,Very disappointing,"The Aquarium of the Pacific just isn't big or impressive enough to justify the price. I think it says alot when the most interesting exhibit was BIRDS (don't miss the lorakeets) instead of FISH.Even though you buy tickets that allow you to enter at a certain time, we found the crowds to be nearly overwhelming.The focus here is on extracting money from your wallet. You'd be much better off driving up the coast to visit the Monterey Bay Aquarium, or even further to the Oregon Coast Aquarium.We won't be back and don't recommend this aquarium.",gd540
50,"Nice, leisurely half-day trip","Being from the desert southwest, I don't often get to explore marine life, so this aquarium was a real treat for both my daughter and myself. It's large enough to offer a wide variety of exhibits but small enough to tackle in half a day. I loved being able to feed a beautiful lorakeet by hand and have never seen so many jellyfish in my life! The shark/crab/squid waterplay areas were a great photo op and a lot of fun for my daughter. I especially loved the giftshop for the wide selection of unique gifts and souvenirs and reasonable prices. This was especially appreciated after having paid an arm and a leg for souvenirs at Disneyland. Also, the aquarium is in walking distance to several restaurants, including the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. right across the street.",SaguaroHugger
40,Fun and Interesting - never too old!,"I went to this aquarium after finishing the long beach marathon since they gave us free tickets!! it was really fun ( even though I was a senior in college!)Seems like a great place for families and children, but its really interesting for almost anyone!",vladnap
50,"Great Place to visit with kids and support a non-profit, just plan it right.","I've seen so many comments about the Aquarium that state it's boring and crowded. As a member for many years, I think smart travelers will find that neither of these things are true, if you plan ahead and really enjoy marine life.It's a So Cal tourist attraction, holidays and weekends are busy, come at opening. Or, to avoid the kids who come on field trips on the weekdays, come after 2pm on a weekday.The Aquarium has amazing exhibits. Someone mentioned they didn't have any tropical fish. I have to wonder if they made it to the second floor where there is an entire gallery dedicated to them. Small kids love to take their time looking at the animals and there is also a play area outside.Keep in mind that the Aquarium is not Sea World, there aren't big shows and cotton candy. Just like an art museum, you are going to get out of it what you choose to. If you walk by the exhibits without taking the time to learn about the animals and appreciate their movements, and miss out on the touch areas and presentations, then you will be out of there in an hour, having learned nothing and wasting your money, but it wouldn't be the Aquarium's fault.",2hapamama
10,NOthing tO Offer...Go to Monterey Bay Aquarium Instead!!!,"Just visit this aquarium over the weekend, and I tell you it suck!! If you've never been to Monterey Bay Aquarium, go there instead. I quarantee your money will be worth it. Aquarium of the Pacific has nothing to offer; what a waste of $$$. There were 7 of us, and yes it was a waste of money and our time, went thru the aquarium in less than two hours. WARNING DO NOT ENTER!!!!",stars00
50,Beautiful aquarium,"Despite living in San Diego, my family and friends are always tempted to buy a membership to the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach. It is far superior to the little Scripps Aquarium in La Jolla.You can pet the baby sharks, watch the sea otters being fed and see an array of magnificently done large tanks. They have sea lions and an accompanying show, but honestly, we are so close to Sea World and the real ocean, that is not one of the draws for me. I love the weedy and leafy sea dragon tank. The lion fish tank is also great. The large tanks really show off the animals.They have an outdoor lorikeet exhibit, and for a few dollars you can buy about a tablespoon's worth of fruit nectar in a cup to feed them. Be careful with little kids, the birds can (and do) bite, but usually not so hard to break the skin.The restaurant within the aquarium has several soups, hamburgers, kids meals and a few vegetarian options. They have two lines (hard to follow where each starts when it is crowded)-- one for the ""deli"" and one for the ""grill."" I usually order the vegetarian sandwich which comes with huge marinated portobello mushrooms and a side salad. They have free refills on coffee and tea.The aquarium does get crowded on weekends. I recommend coming as soon as they open so that you can see everything without a lot of people and then go back through after lunch and revisit your favorites.Costco members can currently purchase discount tickets from Costco online. AAA members get a small percentage discount. And if you are in town for a conference or convention, there is usually a discount if you mention that at the ticket window as well.",egyptdragon
30,Great place when it is quiet,"It was a nice place to visit until all the school children showed up. I know I shouldn't complain about kids and having fun, but when they go into the aquarium and push my nephew out of the way because he is not apart of the group, it gets a bit old. Lots to do including petting stingrays and sharks. The loraket(s?) forest was very exciting. All in all not a bad time, but not a good time.",jwh223
40,A nice place to visit,"In summary, this is a nice half-day'ish outing for the whole family. It seems to be extremely popular with families with young children so be prepared to deal with a lot of kids underfoot, strollers, and the like.This was our first visit to an aquarium so we really didn't know what to expect. We have been to SeaWorld and the Undersea Adventure (I believe that's the name of it) in Mall of America so I was looking for something between the two of these. Don't go here if you're looking animal shows, etc. While there are some 'shows' (mostly feeding sessions along with narration) and interactive exhibits its a lot more of an ocean museum than it is an entertainment destination.I was initially taken aback by the small size of the facility but my family of four (my wife and I, and our two children aged 7 and 9) spent around 5 hours there including a one hour break for lunch.My two children, ages 7 and 9, really enjoyed the interactive exhibits where you got to touch the various sea creatures. There are two large lagoons where you can touch small sharks and rays, and there are a couple of exhibits where you can touch sea urchins, starfish, anemones, and the like. All of these areas are staffed by friendly folks who were able to answer our questions and provide interesting facts about the animals. We all enjoyed trying to spot all of the various animals contained in each of the exhibits.The downside of this attraction is that while there are small information posters here and there the majority of the exhibits are devoid of any information about the animals they contain, what they eat, where they live, etc. This may not bother you at all (my kids didn't notice) but I would have preferred to be given more of a learning opportunity.Finally, although this isn't clear from the website you can purchase your tickets online and print them out at the venue to save $5 per adult ticket. My wife and I balked at purchasing our tickets online since the site asks for your credit card number very early in the process and we figured we would need to be able to print out the tickets before arriving. Since we were travelling and did not have access to a printer we decided to buy at the gate.",ITAlchemy
50,The Best Aquarium in Southern California,We were pleasantly surprised by the extensive collection and loads of activities for the kids. It is a wonderful educational outing for the day. I think they need to market it more thoroughly. They could draw a whole lot more from the Orange County and Los Angeles markets.,Pavlvsdog
20,"Extremely crowded, not impressed with fish variety","I was not impressed with this aquarium at all, the crowds were out of control. It was difficult to see the fish because of the unruly crowds and kids running every where. The fish were not very impressive. Most were fish you can see at one of those aquariums you see in a chinese restaurant. Save your money.",Travelady007
40,Loved it!,We had a great time . Great for small kids!Go early beat the crowds,MeliC
50,Great place for kids and adults!,Will definitely return the next time we are in LA - the kids loved it and there are a ton of nearby restaurants and things to do. We ended up doing a trip around the harbor as well on a boat tour available nearby.,lbm5673
20,"Plan, plan, plan","Everyone says it's crowded with school kids, so we waited until spring vacation. It was OK in the morning, but roving children had no sense of shared space. It was like a kaleidoscope of bright t-shirts and iridescent fish tanks. My daughter's baby stroller, my 3-year-old grandson, and little old me were all intercepted at different locations by eager -- but rude -- older children. By afternoon the place was teeming. I felt the place needed better crowd control and signage. Employees at the mike did a good job, except for one who made the otter exhibit sound like a college course. To get the most out of this visit, I should have studied long and hard. I don't know what to recommend to improve the situation, but I can suggest that you visit PetSmart as a quick, inexpensive alternative. We always put a dollar in the donation box and leave happy after 20 minutes. Best moments at the Aquarium: shark tank, lorikeet walk-thru aviary, and buying a rubber shark at the gift shop.",Sherz88
20,Not that great,"This place is okay for kids, but pretty boring for the adults. It's very crowed and loud. Parking is only $6, but I think it should be free. The food is way overpriced. The attractions are hard to follow, what with all of the baby strollers and rude people getting in your way and pushing in front of you. My party stayed for less than an hour, then cut out to walk around the harbor. Overall, it was a waste of money. Kind of like being at the McDonald's playground, but with fish.",therealkitkat78
10,I felt sorry for the fish!!!!,"The GOOD: There are many species of fish, and the little kids were able to touch and get to know some of them.The BAD: There is not much info on the fish as far as what kind of place they are from, what they do, what they eat, and any interesting facts about them are very limited.The fish and mammals are all kept in a phony enviroment, with plastic kelp, concrete rocks, and fibreglass sea urchins, etc, etc. etc.I would not be surprised if they were swimming around in windex so we could see them better!!I felt bad for the fish being placed in such an enviroment!Sure they are all there for folks to see, but hardly a humane place for them to live.Just look at those poor otters!! they are so out of their natural enviroment, one even has a nervous disorder.It would be like hell for those creatures there.I will not go back!!!!",BusterWiggins
10,Just got back from this place,"I am never going back there.They were packing people in to the place; it was dangerously full to begin with. I saw a rated capacity for one area of 115 people. It had to have 300 people in that area, and the whole place was like that. God forbid they ever have a fire or earthquake, there will be a stampedeDon't bother with a stroller; you will not be able to get it in anywhere. You can’t move without running in to another person.Also it’s $20.00+ a person and 6 dollars to park?!? (they don’t tell you parking costs on the website), for what, a crowded tiny building with few exhibits??.Go to the LA Zoo, 10$ a person, free parking and it’s gigantic.I want my money back from this place; I got ripped off.",ckeveny
40,Nice Side Attraction,"Visited the Aquarium of the Pacific in December with visiting family members.Everyone enjoyed the experience. Lots of hands on activities for the children and adults, and there were some shows to watch. The place is smaller than I thought it would be, but still nice. They have a restaurant on the location, and an excellent gift shop. We found the prices at the gift shop to be extremely reasonable, unlike other tourist attraction gift shops.The kids really enjoyed the bird santuary, where the birds would actually land on your hand/arm and your could feed them. The petting pools were also really fun for the children.I would not plan on spending the whole day there, the attraction is nice for 1/2 day get away.",SNAFU23
40,"Worth a visit, especially with kids",Not a huge aquarium but it's nicely laid out and a blast for kids. If you want to see some fish but don't want to do a whole day at Sea World this is a good place. No big whales or sharks but lots of neat smaller species. Get there early and you'll avoid the crowds.,tconk40554Vegas
20,Not Impressed,"I was not impressed by this aquarium. The exhibits were nice and informative and fish well taken care of. I was glad I didn't pay the full admission price. I expected a full aquarium like I had seen when I lived in Boston. That aquarium was impressive, this one was not.Their 'shark lagoon' was a small sized pond with a dozen sharks in it and the lagoon was not developed at all into a interesting place to see the sharks in a natural environment.The aquarium was mainly focused on the marine environment around northern and southern california. I felt the aquarium should have been called ""Aquarium of the ocean off the coast of California"" as it did not represent what was in the Pacific Ocean especially in the tropical Pacific Ocean area.I will not go back again. The highlight of the trip was not the aquarium but the Border's bookstore across the street.",ChristyCreaks
50,My trip to Cali,Very interesting aquarium. Lots to see. Great restaurant. Would recommend to anyone.,Kelly W
50,Nice Surpise,"This was such a great aquarium - my kids loved toching the sting rays and sand sharks... very interactive. The location on the waterfornt area is really built up... the approach can be somewhat intimidating for out of towners, but well worth the trip. (Bring your nav system!)",Weekly_Traveler
50,Fun family experience,"We brought the kids here on a day break from Disney. It was wonderful. The staff were very informative and helpful. The kids loved petting the various sea creatures, especially the sharks and sting rays. We learned a lot about sea creatures. And, as an added bonus, the food at the restaurant was very good and not outrageously expensive.",Darrenzo1
50,A great morning trip,"We took our almost five year old here after dropping off relatives at LAX (it's about 20 minutes from there).He loved it. It was set up well and the displays were not so big you couldn't see everything. He especially liked the touch tanks with starfish, rays, urchins etc.We didn't eat there although there are restaurants. Nearby attractions are the Queen Mary and harbor cruises. There are plenty of restaurants and shops within walking distance.I know Costco sells discount tickets and if you book online you save $2 per ticket. We used a coupon from the Ventura County Entertainment book for one free adult admission ($19.50). Parking is $6.It was a great morning trip for the three of us and I'd go back.",chimera22
50,Fantastic Day Out!! Don't Miss It ... Your Kids Will LOVE IT!!!,"Aquarium of the Pacific is NOT your average aquarium - it's better!This is a not-for-profit organization that exists to promote preservation and education. BUT, that doesn't mean it's boring! I've read some reviews on TripAdvisor that this aquarium is boring ... well ... it's not!We don't have children, but from the screams of delight coming from the many groups of school kids that were present, all of them were having a blast!My husband and I love aquariums ... big and small, whether they have whales and dolphins or not.The Aquarium of the Pacific focuses mainly on the sealife that is present off the coast of California and they do a fabulous job with their first class displays and very helpful and educational staff.If you're going to visit the Aquarium, don't just go general admission ... the facility offers many ""Behind the Scenes"" limited participation tours ... and they're FABULOUS! Worth every penny! My husband and I did the ""Behind the Scenes Tour"" and it added an amazing element to our day at the Aquarium. You shouldn't miss it! I wish we'd participated in the Animal Encounters ... those sound amazing!!! You truly get a bigger and better feel for what's going on at the Aquarium when you participate in these additional tours ... you learn so much!! And it's interesting ... certainly NOT BORING! Besides the behind the scenes stuff, they also offer harbour tours .. another trip I'd love to take! So, do your research before you visit and check out all of the additional tours they offer ... plan a full day ... you'll be glad you did! AND, remember ... this is a not-for-profit organization, so the money you spend on extra tours, food and sourveniers ... it all goes back into the Aquarium to help them run it daily ... it's a great cause!Also amazing is the fact that this facility is run through the help of many many voluteers ... it's amazing the time and energy that these folks put in ... heart and soul!We can't say enough about the quality of this facility and would encourage anyone, young or old, with or without children to participate in this great day out!",Wanderer32896
40,Beautiful yet small,"I finally had a chance to visit the Aquarium this weekend and I was pretty pleased. I didn't know they had sea turtles, and they were fantastic! The jellyfish are so amazing, it would be nice if they had benches in there so you could stay and watch for a while. I do think $19 is a bit much, because it is quite small, but there were plenty of people there, well there are plenty of kids. I was pushed out of the way by a stroller many times.",MissChris
40,modern and fun,"it is modern and the building is shaped like a whale. IT wasn't the biggest aquarium I have been in, but everything they had was very good. Go outside to the back where you can take stingrays and small sharks. In the big shark pool watch them feeding them from the underwater viewing side where the big sharks and their rows of teeth come right up to you at the glass, yikes! I thought it was a little pricey at $19 for an adult ticket, but hey, I did touch a shark!",bostravelerBoston
50,"Fun, Educational and Totally Worth a Visit","With the huge crowds on the road and the high price of gasoline, we decided to spend the Labor Day weekend exploring some local attractions. We hadn't visited the Aquarium of the Pacific in years and were delighted with our visit. We arrived early and there were already numerous visitors, all of whom were engaged in viewing the fish tanks and other areas of interest. Even with the crowds, there was plenty of room to navigate between the exhibits and lots of room to view the movie. We found the staff to be more than friendly and actually excited to share their knowledge when I asked a question, and I asked many questions about the facility and the animals. I was surprised when many staff members greeted me and asked how I was enjoying the day. Amazingly excellent training was evident throughout the aquarium. The layout of the facility shows many areas of the oceanic life in parts of the Pacific Rim. We learned far more than we anticipated and had an extremely enjoyable experience. Admission is priced right. It’s an excellent diversion for a couple of hours and left plenty of time for a leisurely lunch at Parker’s Lighthouse, just across the water. For quality of exhibits, staff friendliness and educational value I rate it a five. It’s not the Monterrey Bay Aquarium and it doesn’t try to be. It’s a unique and valuable asset to the redeveloping Long Beach shoreline area.",BolsaChicaMoonDancer
50,"A excellent collection of animals, and nice folks","I wonder, if the individual from Ohio was at another facility?? the gate cost is $19. The kids are bothersome, but we just worked around them and a nice employee told us to get our hand stamped and return later in the afternoon... But we found this wonderful coffee cafe in the big hall where we just sat and watched the whale movie...which I cannot remember seeing in my high schoold days?? The production is interesting and I learned about the whales. I have never bee to the SI, but the whale there is hugh, and I was told it life size.Not the employees are just wonderful, they are friendly, courtious and they havve good stories to tell. Just walk upp to one and they will show and tell you so much. I have been to monterey Bay Aquarium and the folks there are just not friendly. In fact it hard to find someone with a red jacket just to ask those questions...The Aquarium of the Pacific, is very nice. I plan to revisit soon.",FarAway6039
20,Warning! Warning! Tourist Trap Ahead!,"First, know that I am a big fan of aquariums--love the Shedd in Chicago (probably my favorite) and also the Carmel Aquarium in Carmel, CA. Since we were visiting friends in LA, and they had not seen either this aquarium in Long Beach or the near-by Queen Mary, we decided to make a day of it.The Aquarium of the Pacific is a major ripoff. It advertises a ""Whale Adventure"" so that you think they actually have whales somewhere. Wrong. The ""Whale Adventure"" is a brief projected film on the walls of the main lobby. Showings are periodically announced with much fanfare and in excited tones. High school film classes could turn out a better product. The only whale on the premises is the model of one hanging overhead, and even it pales compared to the one in the Smithsonian.The Aquarium was overrun with unruly, poorly disciplined camp or school groups. There were screaming, running children everywhere, knocking into and terrorizing adults and generally driving the pleasant young staff members crazy. When I commented to an attendant at the boring shark area that I'll bet he'd like to toss some of those kids in with the sharks, he said that unfortunately, these sharks would just ignore them!With the exception of a very interesting and large jellyfish collection, this aquarium's specimens are typical and dull. Even with crowds, you can easily see the entire place in an hour. Unless you love jellyfish, save your money and don't bother. The entry fee is very expensive, around $35 per person. The Aquarium should do a much better job of limiting the kiddy groups, and they do not have enough workers/security to protect others from these out of control brats. We were aghast that those supposedly in charge of these groups made no attempt to control them.We were very disappointed with the Aquarium of the Pacific and are telling everyone we know who either lives in California or who may go there to skip it. We usually buy souvenirs in gift shops too, and this Aquarium lost out big time because none of our group wanted any souvenirs!Incidentally, we did enjoy the Queen Mary, once we mastered the extremely unclear and complicated bus system as to how to get to it! However, I'm not sure the Queen Mary was worth the entry fee.",Pennfield
20,Boring,"If you have been to Sea World, Boston's aquarium or Montreal's Biodome you will be disapointed. It's too expensive for what you will see. It is very repetitive (you can touch starfishes everywhere). Not a lot of aquariums, not a lot of explanations, boring movie. I would recommend it only to people who have never visited an aquarium or to family with children (if it's raining...).",MelodyMontreal
50,Great for the kids,Took my 6yr old daughter there and she had the BEST time! Great hands-on experience. It's fun for the whole family. Well worth the time and money and we plan to go back very soon.,Experience10186
40,Good Variety,"This aquarium offers a nice selection of animals from the west coast. The basking Pacific Green Sea Turtles need deeper water in their exhibit, but are open to the sea air and sun. I was told that exhibit is scheduled to be expanded. Staff is very friendly and proactive in their service skills.",LIBRA17
