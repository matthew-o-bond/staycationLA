50,Great Massage,"After only having to wait 5 minutes, my masseuse Niki gave me one of the best massages Iâ€™ve had in a long time. She asked me about my concerns and made sure during the time that she was staying on course. The hot stones are soothing as well and she made sure that the stone was not in one area long enough to burn me. It was very soothing.I will return and ask for Niki again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jeane141
