50,"Nice, smaller venue for concerts.","This place was not in the best area of LA, a tiny bit run down, but the theater has a goth feel to it which we loved. My husband and I had balcony seats which was great for us older kids. We had a great time! The only thing that sucked was that it cost $15 for a beer. That's why we had beers at the brew house next door before we went in. If you can get floor tickets , you will have a great experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ibhayhay
50,Great place,Visited here for the first time recently to see charity event Above Ground. What an amazing venue. Quite an intimate setting with great views of the stage both ground level and balcony. Will definitely keep an eye out to see what's on in the future.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenfanti
50,Awesome LA Venue,My husband and I went to a Betty Who concert here on a Saturday night and I loved the smaller venue size. It is general admission on the bottom level and had seats in the balcony and is located in Hollywood. There is not a bad spot and the music sound quality was great - we got drinks at the bar with no line and thoroughly enjoyed the concert there - will definitely be back!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilytO6138AN
50,Rival Sons Concert,"The Fonda Theater is a fantastic venue to hear a band that rocks with a lead singer that belts it out. I had a drink on the roof before they came on stage. I met a few cool folks. Then I went to the balcony and saw the show. When they sang ""Pressure and Time"" the crowd went wild. The murals are funky in the joint are cool. Great concert. The parking was no issue as long as you got to the venue early. Walk Hollywood Blvd. before the show and just people watch. Awesome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/achillesy
50,"Easy hangs, good music = the best venue in LA!","The Fonda is a great mid-size venue in Hollywood. It's a block away from the train station, there's plenty of parking around, lots of good dinner options before shows... It's truly an easy place to navigate. The sound is really great, whether you're on the floor or balcony. You can easily maneuver yourself into a good sight line and it's super fun to dance on the dance floor. The rooftop is a rarity for any venue in Los Angeles, and it's certainly rare for Hollywood. You'll find good views from that rooftop, and they also project the show up there as well as the sound from the concert so if you need a break from the crowds, it's a nice place to get away. This is what makes it my favorite venue in L.A. Many others provide an outdoor space, but normally you're in an alley or somewhere more dodgy - but not here! There's never too long of a line at the bars either, now that I think about it. Or the restrooms - there are some on each floor! As far as the music goes, I've seen so many good acts here - Sofi Tukker, Metallica, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Thom Yorke, Soulwax, Charlotte Gainsbourg - and that's just in the last year alone. Coming up I'm excited to see Rostam and Phoenix! Not only all this but the Hollywood history of the building is really cool. I personally love the outrageous Bosch wallpaper. Give the history a Google!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helloceleste
50,Fave venue in LA!,"I love the Fonda so much. Such a cozy place for gigs. Doesn’t matter how far away you might be from the stage, you still get a nice view from any angle. Ventilation is nice too so even if you’re in front row you get to breathe!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F3895UVdianat
50,Gogol Bordello gig,Great little venue... views of stage also good . But of a nightmare getting wrist bands on but after that it’s really cool. Beer pricey.. but that’s gig venues in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jojomiles
